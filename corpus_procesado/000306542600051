sex-specific adaptation drives early sex chromosome evolution drosophila 
species sex chromosomes derived ancient autosomes show signatures origins studied sex chromosomes drosophila miranda neo-y chromosome originated approximately million years ago whole-genome transcriptome analysis reveals massive degeneration neo-y male-beneficial genes neo-y likely undergo accelerated protein evolution neo-y genes evolve biased expression toward male-specific tissues-the shrinking gene content neo-y becomes masculinized contrast although older x chromosomes show paucity genes expressed male tissues neo-x genes highly expressed male-specific tissues undergo increased rates protein evolution haploid males thus response sex-specific selection can shift different stages x differentiation resulting masculinization demasculinization x-chromosomal gene content
