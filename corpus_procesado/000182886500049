tumor response radiotherapy regulated endothelial cell apoptosis 
% cancer patients receive radiation therapy investigated hypothesis tumor response radiation determined tumor cell phenotype also microvascular sensitivity mca/ fibrosarcomas b16f1 melanomas grown apoptosis-resistant acid sphingomyelinase asmase deficient bax-deficient mice displayed markedly reduced baseline microvascular endothelial apoptosis grew % faster tumors wild-type microvasculature thus endothelial apoptosis homeostatic factor regulating angiogenesis-dependent tumor growth moreover tumors exhibited reduced endothelial apoptosis upon irradiation unlike tumors wild-type mice resistant single-dose radiation grays gy studies indicate microvascular damage regulates tumor cell response radiation clinically relevant dose range
