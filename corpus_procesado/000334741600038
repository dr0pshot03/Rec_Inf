inhibition mir improves cardiac contractility failing heart 
heart failure characterized debilitating decline cardiac function recent clinical trial results indicate improving contractility heart muscle cells boosting intracellular calcium handling might effective therapy micrornas mirnas dysregulated heart failure whether control contractility constitute therapeutic targets remains speculative using high-throughput functional screening human micrornaome identify mirnas suppress intracellular calcium handling heart muscle interacting messenger rna encoding sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium uptake pump serca2a also known atp2a2 mirnas tested mir potently delayed calcium uptake kinetics cardiomyocytes vitro upregulated heart failure mice humans whereas adeno-associated virus aav9-mediated overexpression mir vivo resulted significant loss contractile function injection antisense oligonucleotide antagomir mir markedly halted established heart failure mouse model improving cardiac function survival relative control antagomir oligonucleotide data reveal increased expression endogenous mir contributes declining cardiac function heart failure suggest might targeted therapeutically restore function
