role thrombin signalling platelets haemostasis thrombosis
platelets critical haemostasis arterial thrombosis causes heart attacks events triggered abnormal clotting- coagulation protease thrombin potent activator platelets ex vivo however thrombin also mediates fibrin deposition multiple agonists can trigger platelet activation relative importance platelet activation thrombin haemostasis thrombosis unknown thrombin triggers cellular responses least part protease-activated receptors pars mouse platelets express par3 par4 ref show platelets par4-deficient mice failed change shape mobilize calcium secrete atp aggregate response thrombin result demonstrates par signalling necessary mouse platelet activation thrombin supports model mouse par3 mpar3 mediate transmembrane signalling instead acts cofactor thrombin cleavage activation mpar4 ref importantly par4-deficient mice markedly prolonged bleeding times protected model arteriolar thrombosis thus platelet activation thrombin necessary normal haemostasis may important target treatment thrombosis
