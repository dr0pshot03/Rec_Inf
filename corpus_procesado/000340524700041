chemical signature first-generation massive stars
numerical simulations structure formation early universe predict formation fraction stars several hundred solar masses clear evidence supernovae massive stars however yet found chemical compositions milky way stars report analysis metal-poor star sdss j001820- possesses elemental-abundance ratios differ significantly previously known star star exhibits low [alpha-element fe] ratios large contrasts abundances odd even element pairs scandium/titanium cobalt/nickel features predicted nucleosynthesis models supernovae stars times massive sun suggesting mass distribution first-generation stars might extend solar masses larger
