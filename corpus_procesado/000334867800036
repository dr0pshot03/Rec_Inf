detection gravitational lens magnifying type ia supernova 
objects known brightness like type la supernovae snia can used measure distances massive object warps spacetime form multiple images background snia direct test cosmic expansion also possible however lensing events must first distinguished rare phenomena recently supernova found shine much brighter normal distance resulted debate: new type superluminous supernova normal snia magnified hidden gravitational lens report spectrum obtained supernova faded away shows presence foreground galaxy-the first found strongly magnify snia discuss lensed snia can found previously predicted
