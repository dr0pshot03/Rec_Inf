induction maintenance neuronal cholinergic phenotype central nervous system bmp- 
bone morphogenetic proteins bmps multiple functions developing nervous system member family bmp- found highly expressed embryonic mouse septum spinal cord indicating possible role regulating cholinergic phenotype cultured neurons bmp directly induced expression cholinergic gene locus encoding choline acetyltransferase vesicular acetylcholine transporter up-regulated acetylcholine synthesis effect reversed upon withdrawal bmp- intracerebroventricular injection bmp increased acetylcholine levels vivo although certain bmps also up-regulated cholinergic phenotype vitro less effective bmp- data indicate bmp differentiating factor cholinergic central nervous system neurons
