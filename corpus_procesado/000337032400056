quantitative flux analysis reveals folate-dependent nadph production
atp dominant energy source animals mechanical electrical work example muscle contraction neuronal firing chemical work equally important role nadph powers redox defence reductive biosynthesis direct route produce nadph glucose oxidative pentose phosphate pathway malic enzyme sometimes also important although relative contribution glycolysis oxidative phosphorylation atp production extensively analysed similar analysis nadph metabolism lacking demonstrate ability directly track liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry passage deuterium labelled substrates nadph combine approach carbon labelling mathematical modelling measure nadph fluxes proliferating cells largest contributor cytosolic nadph oxidative pentose phosphate pathway surprisingly nearly comparable contribution comes serine-driven one-carbon metabolism oxidation methylene tetrahydrofolate formyl-tetrahydrofolate coupled reduction nadp+ nadph moreover tracing mitochondrial one-carbon metabolism revealed complete oxidation formyl-tetrahydrofolate make nadph folate metabolism previously considered nadph producer confirmation functional significance undertaken knockdown methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase mthfd genes depletion either cytosolic mitochondrial mthfd isozyme resulted decreased cellular nadph/nadp+ reduced/oxidized glutathione ratios gsh/gssg increased cell sensitivity oxidative stress thus although importance folate metabolism proliferating cells long recognized attributed function producing one-carbon units nucleic acid synthesis another crucial function pathway generating reducing power
