topology human mouse m6a rna methylomes revealed m6a-seq 
extensive repertoire modifications known underlie versatile coding structural catalytic functions rna remains largely uncharted territory although biochemical studies indicate n--methyladenosine m6a prevalent internal modification messenger rna in-depth study distribution functions impeded lack robust analytical methods present human mouse m6a modification landscape transcriptome-wide manner using novel approach m6a-seq based antibody-mediated capture massively parallel sequencing identify m6a sites characterized typical consensus transcripts human genes sites preferentially appear two distinct landmarks-around stop codons within long internal exons-and highly conserved human mouse although sites well preserved across normal cancerous tissues response various stimuli subset stimulus-dependent dynamically modulated sites identified silencing m6a methyltransferase significantly affects gene expression alternative splicing patterns resulting modulation p53 also known tp53 signalling pathway apoptosis findings therefore suggest rna decoration m6a fundamental role regulation gene expression
