functional role adult hippocampal neurogenesis spatial pattern separation
dentate gyrus dg mammalian hippocampus hypothesized mediate pattern separation-the formation distinct orthogonal representations mnemonic information-and also undergoes neurogenesis throughout life neurogenesis contributes hippocampal function largely unknown using adult mice hippocampal neurogenesis ablated found specific impairments spatial discrimination two behavioral assays: spatial navigation radial arm maze task ii spatial non-navigable task mouse touch screen mice ablated neurogenesis impaired stimuli presented little spatial separation stimuli widely separated space thus newborn neurons may necessary normal pattern separation function dg adult mice
