electrochemically induced annealing stainless-steel surfaces 
modification surface properties metals without affecting bulk properties technological interest demanding applications surface stability hardness important austenitic stainless steel heavily plastically deformed grinding rolling martensitic phase transformation occurs causes significant changes bulk surface mechanical properties- alloy martensitic phase can also generated stainless-steel surfaces cathodic charging consequence lattice strain generated absorbed hydrogen- heat treatment steel temperatures several hundred degrees can result loss martensitic structure alters bulk properties alloy show martensitic structures stainless steel can removed appropriate electrochemical treatment aqueous solutions much lower temperature conventional annealing treatments electrochemically induced annealing process allows hardness cold-worked stainless steels maintained eliminating brittle martensitic phase surface using approach able anneal surface near-surface regions specimens contain rolling-induced martensite throughout bulk well containing surface martensite induced grinding although origin electrochemical annealing process still needs clarification expect treatment will lead development enhancing surface properties metals
