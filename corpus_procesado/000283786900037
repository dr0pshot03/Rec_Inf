video imaging walking myosin v high-speed atomic force microscopy
dynamic behaviour myosin v molecules translocating along actin filaments mainly studied optical microscopy processive hand-over-hand movement coupled hydrolysis adenosine triphosphate thereby demonstrated however protein molecules invisible observations therefore visualized electron microscopy stationary states concomitant assessment structure dynamics unfeasible situation prevailing throughout biological research directly visualize myosin v molecules walking along actin tracks using high-speed atomic force microscopy high-resolution movies provide corroborative visual evidence previously speculated demonstrated molecular behaviours including lever-arm swing also reveal detailed behaviours molecules leading comprehensive understanding motor mechanism direct dynamic high-resolution visualization powerful new approach studying structure dynamics biomolecules action
