cerebellum activation associated performance change motor learning
issue whether cerebellum contributes motor skill learning controversial principally difficulty separating effects motor learning changes performance performed functional magnetic resonance imaging investigation implicit motor sequence-learning task designed separate two processes sequence-encoding phase human participants performed concurrent distractor task served suppress performance changes associated learning upon removal distractor participants showed evidence learned cerebellar activation associated learning phase despite extensive involvement cortical subcortical regions however significant cerebellar activation expression learning thus cerebellum contribute learning motor skill engaged primarily modification performance
