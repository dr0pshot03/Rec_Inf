priming broadly neutralizing antibody response hiv using germline-targeting immunogen 
major goal hiv vaccine research design immunogens capable inducing broadly neutralizing antibodies bnabs bind viral envelope glycoprotein env poor binding env unmutated precursors bnabs including vrc01 class appears major problem bnab induction engineered immunogen binds vrc01-class bnab precursors immunized knock-in mice expressing germline-reverted vrc01 heavy chains induced antibodies showed characteristics vrc01-class bnabs including short cdrl3 light-chain complementarity-determining region mutations favored binding near-native hiv gp120 constructs contrast native-like immunogens failed activate vrc01-class precursors results suggest rational epitope design can prime rare b cell precursors affinity maturation desired targets
