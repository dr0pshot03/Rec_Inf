poleward heat transport atmospheric heat engine 
atmospheric heat transport earth equator poles largely carried mid-latitude storms however satisfactory theory describe fundamental feature earths climate12 previous studies characterized poleward heat transport diffusion eddies specified horizontal length velocity scales little agreement scales be3- propose instead regard baroclinic zone-the zone strong temperature gradients active eddies-as heat engine generates eddy kinetic energy transporting heat warmer colder region view leads new velocity scale tested along previously proposed length velocity scales using numerical climate simulations eddy properties varied changing forcing boundary conditions experiments show eddy velocity varies accordance new scale size eddies varies well-known rhines beta-scale results give new insight atmospheric eddy heat transport also allow simple estimates intensities mid-latitude storms hitherto possible expensive general circulation models
