ectoderm mesoderm lineage switching axolotl tail regeneration 
foreign environments may induce adult stem cells switch lineages populate multiple tissue types whether mechanism used tissue repair remains uncertain urodele amphibians can regenerate fully functional multitissue structures including limb tail determine whether lineage switching integral feature regeneration followed individual spinal cord cells live tail regeneration axolotl spinal cord cells frequently migrate surrounding tissue form regenerating muscle cartilage thus axolotls cells switch lineage real example regeneration
