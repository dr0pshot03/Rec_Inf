crystal structure escherichia coli mscs voltage-modulated mechanosensitive channel 
mechanosensitive channel small conductance mscs responds stretching cell membrane membrane depolarization crystal structure angstroms resolution demonstrates escherichia coli mscs folds membrane-spanning heptamer large cytoplasmic region subunit contains three transmembrane helices tm1 tm3 helices lining pore tm1 tm2 membrane-embedded arginines likely candidates tension voltage sensors transmembrane pore apparently captured open state connects large chamber formed within cytoplasmic region connects cytoplasm openings may function molecular filters although mscs likely structurally distinct ion channels similarities gating mechanisms suggest common structural elements
