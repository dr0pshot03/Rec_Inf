effects antibiotics proto-oncogene homolog destruction protein translocator secy
protein secretion occurs via translocation evolutionarily conserved sec complex lacz hybrid proteins long used study translocation escherichia coli lacz hybrids thought block secretion physically jamming sec complex leading cell death found jammed sec complexes caused degradation essential translocator components protease ftsh increasing amounts stability membrane protein ycca known inhibitor ftsh counteracted destruction antibiotics inhibit translation elongation also jammed translocator caused degradation translocator components may contribute effectiveness intriguingly ycca functional homolog proto-oncogene product bax inhibitor- may share similar mechanism action regulating apoptosis upon prolonged secretion stress
