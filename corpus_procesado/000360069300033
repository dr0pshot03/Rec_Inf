atomic inner-shell laser -angstrom wavelength pumped x-ray free-electron laser 
since invention first lasers visible-light region research aimed produce short-wavelength lasers generate coherent x-rays shorter wavelength better imaging resolution laser shorter pulse duration leading better temporal resolution probe measurements recently free-electron lasers based self-amplified spontaneous emission made possible generate hard-x-ray laser photon energy order ten kiloelectronvolts anngstrom-wavelength regime enabling advances fields ultrafast x-ray spectrosopy x-ray quantum optics atomic laser based neon atoms pumped soft-x-ray photon energy less one kiloelectronvolt free-electron laser achieved wavelength nanometres7 use copper target report hard-x-ray inner-shell atomic laser operating wavelength angstroms x-ray free-electron laser pulses intensity watts per square centimetre tuned copper k-absorption edge produced sufficient population inversion generate strong amplified spontaneous emission copper ka lines furthermore operated x-ray free-electron laser source two-colour mode one colour tuned pumping seed starting light laser
