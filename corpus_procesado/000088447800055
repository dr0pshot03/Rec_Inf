soluble adenylyl cyclase evolutionarily conserved bicarbonate sensor 
spermatozoa undergo poorly understood activation process induced bicarbonate mediated cyclic adenosine -monophosphate camp assumed bicarbonate mediates effects changes intracellular ph membrane potential however demonstrate bicarbonate directly stimulates mammalian soluble adenylyl cyclase sac activity vivo vitro ph-independent manner sac similar adenylyl cyclases cyanobacteria bicarbonate regulation cyclase activity conserved early forms life sac also expressed bicarbonate-responsive tissues suggests bicarbonate regulation camp signaling plays fundamental role many biological systems
