biasing reaction pathways mechanical force
course chemical reactions reactant molecules need surmount energy barrier allow transformation products energy needed process usually provided heat light pressure electrical potential act either changing distribution reactants ground-state potential energy surface moving onto excited-state potential energy surface thereby facilitate movement energy barrier fundamentally different way initiating accelerating reaction use force deform reacting molecules along specific direction reaction coordinate mechanical force indeed shown activate covalent bonds polymers usual result chain scission show mechanically sensitive chemical groups make possible harness mechanical forces generated exposing polymer solutions ultrasound allows us accelerate rearrangement reactions bias reaction pathways yield products obtainable purely thermal light-induced reactions find placed within long polymer strands trans cis isomers -disubstituted benzocyclobutene undergo ultrasound-induced electrocyclic ring opening formally conrotatory formally disrotatory process respectively yield identical products contrasts reaction initiation light heat alone case isomers follow mutually exclusive pathways different products mechanical forces associated ultrasound can thus clearly alter shape potential energy surfaces otherwise forbidden slow processes proceed mild conditions directionally specific nature mechanical forces providing reaction control fundamentally different achieved adjusting chemical physical parameters rearrangement system occurs chain scission effect describe might allow development materials activated mechanical stress fields
