rapid evolution drives ecological dynamics predator-prey system 
ecological evolutionary dynamics can occur similar timescales- however theoretical predictions rapid evolution can affect ecological dynamics inconclusive often depend untested model assumptions report rapid prey evolution response oscillating predator density affects predator-prey rotifer-algal cycles laboratory microcosms experiments tested explicit predictions model system allows prey evolution verified predicted existence evolutionary tradeoff algal competitive ability defence consumption examined effects cycle dynamics manipulating evolutionary potential prey population single-clone algal cultures lacking genetic variability produced short cycle periods typical quarter-period phase lags prey predator densities whereas multi-clonal genetically variable algal cultures produced long cycles prey predator densities nearly phase exactly predicted results confirm prey evolution can substantially alter predator-prey dynamics therefore attempts understand population oscillations nature neglect potential effects ongoing rapid evolution
