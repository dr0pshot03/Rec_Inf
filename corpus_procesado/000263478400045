cytosolic viral sensor rig-i -triphosphate-dependent translocase double-stranded rna 
retinoic acid inducible gene rig cytosolic multidomain protein detects viral rna elicits antiviral immune response two n terminal caspase activation recruitment domains cards transmit signal regulatory domain prevents signaling absence viral rna triphosphate double stranded rna dsrna two molecular patterns enable rig discriminate pathogenic self rna however function dexh box helicase domain also required activity less clear using single molecule protein induced fluorescence enhancement discovered robust adenosine triphosphate powered dsrna translocation activity rig cards dramatically suppress translocation absence triphosphate activation triphosphate triggers rig translocate preferentially dsrna cis functional integration two rna molecular patterns may provide means specifically sense counteract replicating viruses
