combinatorial gene regulation modulation relative pulse timing 
studies individual living cells revealed many transcription factors activate dynamic often stochastic pulses within cell however remained unclear whether cells might exploit dynamic interaction pulses control gene expression using quantitative single-cell time-lapse imaging saccharomyces cerevisiae show pulsatile transcription factors msn2 mig1 combinatorially regulate target genes modulation relative pulse timing activator msn2 repressor mig1 showed pulsed activation either temporally overlapping non-overlapping manner transient response different inputs non-overlapping dynamics efficiently activating target gene expression similarly constant environmental conditions msn2 mig1 exhibit sporadic pulsing glucose concentration modulated temporal overlap pulses two factors together results reveal time-based mode combinatorial gene regulation regulation relative signal timing common engineering neurobiology results suggest also function broadly within signalling regulatory systems cell
