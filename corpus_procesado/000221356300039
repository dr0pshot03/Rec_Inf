food-web interactions govern resistance communities non-random extinctions
growing concern loss biodiversity will affect ecosystems stimulated numerous studies- although studies assumed species go extinct randomly- species often go extinct order sensitivity stress intensifies time climate change show consequences random ordered extinctions differ depend food-web interactions create compensation increase species competitors and/or predators decrease density due environmental stress compensation makes communities whole resistant stress reducing changes combined species densities extinctions progress potential compensation depleted communities become progressively less resistant ordered extinctions however depletion offset communities retain resistance surviving species greater average resistance stress despite extinctions ordered changes food web successive extinctions make difficult predict species will show compensation future unpredictability argues whole-ecosystem approaches biodiversity conservation seemingly insignificant species may become important species go extinct
