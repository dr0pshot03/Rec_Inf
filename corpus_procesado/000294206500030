lgr5 homologues associate wnt receptors mediate r-spondin signalling 
adult stem cell marker lgr5 relative lgr4 often co-expressed wnt-driven proliferative compartments find conditional deletion genes mouse gut impairs wnt target gene expression results rapid demise intestinal crypts thus phenocopying wnt pathway inhibition mass spectrometry demonstrates lgr4 lgr5 associate frizzled/lrp wnt receptor complex four r-spondins secreted wnt pathway agonists can bind lgr4 hek293 cells rspo1 enhances canonical wnt signals initiated wnt3a removal lgr4 affect wnt3a signalling abrogates rspo1-mediated signal enhancement phenomenon rescued re-expression lgr4 genetic deletion lgr4/ mouse intestinal crypt cultures phenocopies withdrawal rspo1 can rescued wnt pathway activation lgr5 homologues facultative wnt receptor components mediate wnt signal enhancement soluble r-spondin proteins results will guide future studies towards application r-spondins regenerative purposes tissues expressing lgr5 homologues
