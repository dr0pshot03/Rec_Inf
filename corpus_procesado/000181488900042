core formation planetesimals triggered permeable flow 
tungsten isotope composition meteorites indicates core formation planetesimals occurred within million years solar system formation12 core formation requires mechanism segregating metal wetting properties molten iron alloy olivine-rich matrix thought preclude segregation permeable flow unless silicate partially molten3- excess liquid metal percolation threshold however can potentially create permeability solid matrix thereby permitting segregation report percolation threshold molten iron-sulphur compounds approximately vol% solid olivine based electrical conductivity measurements made situ high pressure temperature conclude heating within planetesimals decay short-lived radionuclides can increase temperature sufficiently iron-sulphur melting point similar to1000degreesc trigger segregation iron alloy permeable flow within short time-frame indicated tungsten isotopes infer planetesimals radii greater km larger planetary embryos expected formed cores early objects contained much mass terrestrial region protoplanetary nebula earth terrestrial planets likely therefore formed accretion previously differentiated planetesimals earths core may accordingly viewed blended composite preformed cores
