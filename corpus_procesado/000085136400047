connectivity marine populations: open closed
marine populations thought well connected via long-distance dispersal larval stages eulerian lagrangian flow models coupled linear mortality estimates used examine assumption findings show simple advection models used larval exchange rates may overestimated simplistic models fail account decrease nine orders magnitude larval concentrations resulting diffusion mortality alternative process larval retention near local populations shown exist may great importance maintenance marine population structure management coastal marine resources
