powerful bursting radio source towards galactic centre 
transient astronomical sources typically powered compact objects usually signify highly explosive dynamic events1 although high-time-resolution observations often possible radio astronomy2 usually limited quite narrow fields view dynamic radio sky therefore poorly sampled contrast situation x-ray gamma-ray bands wide-field instruments routinely detect transient sources3 report transient radio source gcrt j1745 detected moderately wide-field monitoring programme galactic centre region45 ghz characteristics bursts unlike known class radio transient located near galactic centre brightness temperature k implied energy density within gcrt j1745 vastly exceed observed classes radio astronomical sources6 consistent coherent emission processes7 rarely observed conclude represents hitherto unknown class transient radio sources first possibly many new classes may discovered emerging wide-field radio telescopes8
