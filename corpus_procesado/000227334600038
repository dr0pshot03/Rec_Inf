powerful bursting radio source towards galactic centre 
transient astronomical sources typically powered compact objects usually signify highly explosive dynamic events although high-time-resolution observations often possible radio astronomy usually limited quite narrow fields view dynamic radio sky therefore poorly sampled contrast situation x-ray gamma-ray bands wide-field instruments routinely detect transient sources report transient radio source gcrt j1745 detected moderately wide-field monitoring programme galactic centre region ghz characteristics bursts unlike known class radio transient located near galactic centre brightness temperature k implied energy density within gcrt j1745 vastly exceed observed classes radio astronomical sources consistent coherent emission processes rarely observed conclude represents hitherto unknown class transient radio sources first possibly many new classes may discovered emerging wide-field radio telescopes
