pdz domain binding selectivity optimized across mouse proteome
pdz domains long thought cluster discrete functional classes defined peptide-binding preferences used protein microarrays quantitative fluorescence polarization characterize binding selectivity mouse pdz domains respect genome-encoded peptides trained multidomain selectivity model predict pdz domain-peptide interactions across mouse proteome accuracy exceeds many large-scale experimental investigations protein-protein interactions contrary current paradigm pdz domains fall discrete classes instead evenly distributed throughout selectivity space suggests optimized across proteome minimize cross-reactivity predict focusing families interaction domains facilitates integration experimentation modeling will play increasingly important role future investigations protein function
