carbon-carbon bond cleavage rearrangement benzene trinuclear titanium hydride 
cleavage carbon-carbon c-c bonds transition metals great interest especially transformation can used produce fuels industrially important chemicals natural resources petroleum biomass carbon-carbon bonds quite stable consequently unreactive many reaction conditions industrial naphtha hydrocracking process aromatic carbon skeleton benzene can transformed methylcyclopentane acyclic saturated hydrocarbons c-c bond cleavage rearrangement surfaces solid catalysts1- however chemical transformations usually require high temperatures fairly non-selective microorganisms can degrade aromatic compounds ambient conditions mechanistic details known difficult mimic7 several transition metal complexes reported cleave c-c bonds selective fashion special circumstances relief ring strain formation aromatic system chelation-assisted cyclometallation beta-carbon elimination8- however cleavage benzene transition metal complex reported16- report c-c bond cleavage rearrangement benzene trinuclear titanium poly-hydride complex benzene ring transformed sequentially methylcyclopentenyl -methylpentenyl species cleavage aromatic carbon skeleton multi-titanium sites results suggest multinuclear titanium hydrides serve unique platform activation aromatic molecules may facilitate design new catalysts transformation inactive aromatics
