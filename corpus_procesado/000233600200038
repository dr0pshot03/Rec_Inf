atmospheric methane nitrous oxide late pleistocene antarctic ice cores 
european project ice coring antarctica dome c ice core enables us extend existing records atmospheric methane ch4 nitrous oxide n2o back years present combined record ch4 measured along dome c vostok ice cores demonstrates within resolution measurements preindustrial concentrations antarctica exceeded +/ ppbv parts per billion volume past years years ago interglacials cooler maximum ch4 concentrations ppbv similar lower holocene values contrast n2o record shows maximum concentrations +/ ppbv slightly higher early holocene values
