linus pauling established conceptual framework understanding mimicking enzymes six decades ago notion enzymes selectively stabilize rate-limiting transition state catalysed reaction relative bound ground state reduces problem design one molecular recognition nevertheless past attempts capitalize idea example using transition state analogues elicit antibodies catalytic activities generally failed deliver true enzymatic rates advent computational design approaches combined directed evolution provided opportunity revisit problem starting computationally designed catalyst kemp elimination-a well-studied model system proton transfer carbon-we show artificial enzyme can evolved accelerates elementary chemical reaction x -fold approaching exceptional efficiency highly optimized natural enzymes triosephosphate isomerase angstrom resolution crystal structure evolved enzyme indicates familiar catalytic strategies shape complementarity precisely placed catalytic groups can successfully harnessed afford high rate accelerations making us optimistic prospects designing sophisticated catalysts
