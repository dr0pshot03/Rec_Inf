shallow fault-zone dilatancy recovery bam earthquake iran 
earthquakes radiate slip discrete faults also commonly involve distributed deformation within broader fault zone especially near surface variations rock strain earthquake caused heterogeneity elastic stress earthquake variable material properties geometry fault zones dynamic processes rupture stress changes due earthquake slip dynamic static long thought cause dilatancy fault zone recovers earthquake- decreases velocity seismic waves passing fault zone due coseismic dilatancy observed followed postseismic seismic velocity increases healing dilatancy recovery previously observed geodetically use interferometric analysis synthetic aperture radar images measure postseismic surface deformation bam iran earthquake show reversal coseismic dilatancy shallow fault zone causes subsidence surface compaction fault zone directly patch greatest coseismic slip depth dilatancy compaction probably reflects distributed shear damage material earthquake heals afterwards coseismic postseismic deformation spread fault zone volume may resolve paradox shallow slip deficits strike-slip fault ruptures
