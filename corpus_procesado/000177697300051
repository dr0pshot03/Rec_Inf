oxidation-resistant gold clusters
gold nanoparticles ranging diameter nanometers prepared top silicon wafers order study size dependence oxidation behavior exposed atomic oxygen x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy showed maximum oxidation resistance magic-number clusters containing gold atoms inertness related electron confinement leading size-induced metal-to-insulator transition rather seems linked closed-shell structure magic clusters result additionally suggests gold clusters may act especially effective oxidation catalysts oxidizing carbon monoxide
