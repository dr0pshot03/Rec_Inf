structural diversity sodium 
sodium exhibits pronounced minimum melting temperature similar gigapascals kelvin using single crystal high pressure diffraction techniques found minimum sodium melting curve associated concentration seven different crystalline phases slight changes pressure and/ temperature induce transitions numerous structural modifications several highly complex complexity phase behavior gigapascals suggests extraordinary liquid solid states sodium extreme conditions implications seemingly simple metals
