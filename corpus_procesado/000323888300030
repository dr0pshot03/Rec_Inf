bacteria activate sensory neurons modulate pain inflammation
nociceptor sensory neurons specialized detect potentially damaging stimuli protecting organism initiating sensation pain eliciting defensive behaviours bacterial infections produce pain unknown molecular mechanisms although presumed secondary immune activation demonstrate bacteria directly activate nociceptors immune response mediated tlr2 myd88 t cells b cells neutrophils monocytes necessary staphylococcus aureus-induced pain mice mechanical thermal hyperalgesia mice correlated live bacterial load rather tissue swelling immune activation bacteria induce calcium flux action potentials nociceptor neurons part via bacterial n-formylated peptides pore-forming toxin alpha-haemolysin distinct mechanisms specific ablation nav1-lineage neurons include nociceptors abrogated pain bacterial infection concurrently increased local immune infiltration lymphadenopathy draining lymph node thus bacterial pathogens produce pain directly activating sensory neurons modulate inflammation unsuspected role nervous systemin host-pathogen interactions
