nitride semiconductors free electrostatic fields efficient white light-emitting diodes
compact solid-state lamps based light-emitting diodes leds current technological interest alternative conventional light bulbs brightest leds available far emit red light exhibit higher luminous efficiency fluorescent lamps luminous efficiency transferred white leds power consumption dramatically reduced great economic ecological consequences luminous efficiency existing white leds still low owing presence electrostatic fields within active layers fields generated spontaneous piezoelectric polarization along [] axis hexagonal group-iii nitrides-the commonly used materials light generation- unfortunately crystallographic orientation corresponds natural growth direction materials deposited currently available substrates demonstrate epitaxial growth gan/algan tetragonal lialo non-polar direction allows fabrication structures free electrostatic fields resulting improved quantum efficiency expect approach will pave way towards highly efficient white leds
