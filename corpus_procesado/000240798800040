bose-einstein condensation quasi-equilibrium magnons room temperature pumping 
bose-einstein condensation12 one fascinating phenomena predicted quantum mechanics involves formation collective quantum state composed identical particles integer angular momentum bosons particle density exceeds critical value achieve bose einstein condensation one can either decrease temperature increase density bosons predicted34 quasi-equilibrium system bosons undergo bose einstein condensation even relatively high temperatures flow rate energy pumped system exceeds critical value report observation bose einstein condensation gas magnons room temperature magnons quanta magnetic excitations magnetically ordered ensemble magnetic moments thermal equilibrium can described bose einstein statistics zero chemical potential temperature-dependent density experiments presented show using technique microwave pumping possible excite additional magnons create gas quasi-equilibrium magnons non-zero chemical potential increasing pumping intensity chemical potential reaches energy lowest magnon state bose condensate magnons formed
