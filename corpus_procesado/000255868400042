imaging stem-cell-driven regeneration mammals
ability observe biological processes continuously instead discrete time points holds great promise study tissue regeneration ideally single cells followed continuously within large tissue volumes organs long periods time technical limitations however preclude studies recently improvements imaging technologies biologically compatible labelling agents together new insights molecular characteristics stem cells ultimately responsible regenerative potential tissues researchers now much closer applying single-cell imaging approaches research regeneration clinical applications
