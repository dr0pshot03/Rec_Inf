spin-charge separation localization one dimension 
report measurements quantum many-body modes ballistic wires dependence coulomb interactions obtained tunneling two parallel wires gaas/algaas heterostructure varying electron density observed two spin modes one charge mode coupled wires mapped dispersion velocities modes critical density spontaneous localization observed theoretical calculations charge velocity agree well data although also predict additional charge mode observed measured spin velocity smaller theoretically predicted
