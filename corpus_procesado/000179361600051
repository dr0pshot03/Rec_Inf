combining sensory information: mandatory fusion within senses 
humans use multiple sources sensory information estimate environmental properties example eyes hands provide relevant information objects shape eyes estimate shape using binocular disparity perspective projection etc hands supply haptic shape information means tactile proprioceptive cues combining information across cues can improve estimation object properties may come cost: loss single-cue information report single-cue information indeed lost cues within sensory modality disparity texture gradients vision combined different modalities vision haptics combined
