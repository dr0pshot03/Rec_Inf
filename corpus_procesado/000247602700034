body-centered cubic iron-nickel alloy earths core
cosmochemical geochemical geophysical studies provide evidence earths core contains iron substantial % amounts nickel iron-nickel alloy feni studied situ means angle-dispersive x-ray diffraction internally heated diamond anvil cells dacs resistance measured function pressure temperature pressures gigapascals temperatures kelvin feni adopts body-centered cubic structure experimental theoretical results support interpretation shockwave data pure iron showing solid-solid phase transition gigapascals also suggest iron alloys geochemically reasonable compositions substantial nickel sulfur silicon content adopt bcc structure earths inner core
