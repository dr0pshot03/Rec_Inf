stereospecific binding disordered peptide segment mediates bk channel inactivation
number functionally important actions proteins mediated short intrinsically disordered peptide segments molecular interactions allow disordered domains mediate effects remain topic active investigation- many k+ channel proteins initial channel opening show time-dependent reduction current flux termed inactivation involves movement mobile cytosolic peptide segments approximately residues position physically occludes ion permeation- peptide segments produce inactivation show little amino-acid identity- tolerate appreciable mutational substitutions without disrupting inactivation process solution nuclear magnetic resonance several isolated inactivation domains reveals substantial conformational heterogeneity minimal tendency ordered structures- channel inactivation mechanisms may therefore help us decipher intrinsically disordered regions mediate functional effects whereas many aspects inactivation voltage-dependent k+ channels kv can described simple one-step occlusion mechanism inactivation voltage-dependent large-conductance ca2+-gated k+ bk channel mediated peptide segments auxiliary beta-subunits involves two distinguishable kinetic steps show two-step inactivation mediated intrinsically disordered bk beta-subunit peptide involves stereospecific binding interaction precedes blockade contrast blocking mediated shaker kv inactivation peptide consistent direct simple occlusion hydrophobic segment without substantial steric requirement results indicate two distinct types molecular interaction disordered peptide segments binding sites produce qualitatively similar functions
