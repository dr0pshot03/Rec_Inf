light stimulates growth proteorhodopsin-containing marine flavobacteria 
proteorhodopsins bacterial light-dependent proton pumps discovery within genomic material uncultivated marine bacterioplankton caused considerable excitement indicated potential phototrophic function within organisms previously considered strictly chemotrophic subsequent studies established sequences encoding proteorhodopsin broadly distributed throughout worlds oceans- nevertheless role proteorhodopsins native marine bacteria still unknown show analysis complete genomes three marine flavobacteria cultivated bacteria phylum bacteroidetes one principal components marine bacterioplankton contain proteorhodopsin moreover growth experiments natural artificial seawater low labile organic matter typical worlds oceans establish exposure light results marked increase cell yield one bacterium dokdonia sp strain med134 compared cells grown darkness thus results show phototrophy conferred proteorhodopsin can provide critical amounts energy respiration maintenance also active growth marine bacterioplankton natural environment
