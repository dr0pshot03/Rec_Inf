spin-galvanic effect 
much recent interest exploiting spin conduction electrons semiconductor heterostructures together charge realize new device concepts1 electrical currents usually generated electric magnetic fields gradients example carrier concentration temperature electron spin spin-polarized electron gas can principle also drive electrical current even room temperature general symmetry requirements met demonstrate spin-galvanic effect semiconductor heterostructures induced non-equilibrium uniform population electron spins microscopic origin effect two electronic sub-bands spin-up spin-down electrons shifted momentum space although electron distribution sub-band symmetric inherent asymmetry spin-flip scattering events two sub-bands resulting current flow detected applying magnetic field rotate optically oriented non-equilibrium spin polarization direction sample plane contrast previous experiments spin-polarized currents driven electric fields semiconductor23we complementary situation electron spins drive current without need external electric field
