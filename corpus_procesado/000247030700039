high-resolution high-sensitivity nmr nanolitre anisotropic samples coil spinning 
nuclear magnetic resonance nmr can probe local structure dynamic properties liquids solids making one powerful versatile analytical methods available today however intrinsically low sensitivity precludes nmr analysis small samples frequently used studying isotopically labelled biological molecules advanced materials preferred conducting high-throughput screening biological samples lab-on-a-chip studies sensitivity nmr improved using static micro-coils alternative detection schemes pre-polarization approaches strategies easily used nmr experiments involving fast sample spinning essential obtaining well-resolved spectra non-liquid samples demonstrate inductive coupling allows wireless transmission radio-frequency pulses reception nmr signals fast spinning detector coil sample enables nmr measurements characterized optimal filling factor high radio-frequency field amplitudes enhanced sensitivity increases decreasing sample volume signals obtained nanolitre-sized samples organic powders biological tissue increase almost one order magnitude equivalently acquired two orders magnitude faster compared standard nmr measurements approach also offers optimal sensitivity studying samples need confined inside multiple safety barriers radioactive materials principle co-rotation micrometre-sized detector coil sample use inductive coupling techniques heart method enable highly sensitive nmr measurements mass-limited sample requires fast mechanical rotation obtain well-resolved spectra method easy implement commercial nmr set-up exhibits improved performance miniaturization accordingly expect will facilitate development novel solid-state nmr methodologies find wide use high-throughput chemical biomedical analysis
