evidence young volcanism mercury third messenger flyby
first two flybys mercury messenger spacecraft acquired images confirming pervasive volcanism occurred early planets history messengers third mercury flyby revealed kilometer-diameter peak-ring impact basin among youngest basins yet seen inner floor filled spectrally distinct smooth plains plains sparsely cratered postdate formation basin apparently formed material flowed across surface therefore interpreted volcanic origin irregular depression surrounded halo bright deposits northeast basin marks candidate explosive volcanic vent larger previously identified mercury volcanism planet thus spanned considerable duration perhaps extending well second half solar system history
