promiscuity evolutionary transition complex societies
theory predicts evolution cooperative behaviour favoured low levels promiscuity leading high within-group relatedness- however vertebrates cooperation often occurs non-relatives promiscuity rates among highest recorded resolve apparent inconsistency phylogenetic analysis bird species demonstrating cooperative breeding associated low promiscuity cooperative species helping common promiscuity low intermediate levels promiscuity favour kin discrimination overall results suggest promiscuity unifying feature across taxa explaining transitions cooperative societies
