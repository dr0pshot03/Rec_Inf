human cytomegalovirus directly induces antiviral protein viperin enhance infectivity
viperin interferon-inducible protein directly induced cells human cytomegalovirus hcmv infection hcmv induce viperin antiviral activity unknown show hcmv-induced viperin disrupts cellular metabolism enhance infectious process viperin interaction viral protein vmia resulted viperin relocalization endoplasmic reticulum mitochondria viperin interacted mitochondrial trifunctional protein mediates beta-oxidation fatty acids generate adenosine triphosphate atp interaction viperin mutant lacking viperin iron-sulfur cluster-binding motif reduced cellular atp generation resulted actin cytoskeleton disruption enhancement infection function viperin previously attributed vmia suggests hcmv coopted viperin facilitate infectious process
