nuclear genomic sequences reveal polar bears old distinct bear lineage 
recent studies shown polar bear matriline mitochondrial dna evolved brown bear lineage since late pleistocene potentially indicating rapid speciation adaption arctic conditions present high-resolution data set multiple independent loci across nuclear genomes broad sample polar brown black bears bayesian coalescent analyses place polar bears outside brown bear clade date divergence much earlier middle pleistocene thousand years ago provides time polar bear evolution confirms previous suggestions polar bears carry introgressed brown bear mitochondrial dna due past hybridization results highlight multilocus genomic analyses crucial accurate understanding evolutionary history
