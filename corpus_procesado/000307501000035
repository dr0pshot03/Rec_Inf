massive cooling-flow-induced starburst core luminous cluster galaxies 
cores clusters galaxies hot intracluster plasma dense enough cool radiatively clusters lifetime- leading continuous cooling flows gas sinking towards cluster centre yet cooling flow observed low observed star-formation rates cool gas masses cool-core clusters suggest much cooling must offset feedback prevent formation runaway cooling flow- report x-ray optical infrared observations galaxy cluster spt-clj2344 ref redshift z observations reveal exceptionally luminous x erg s- galaxy cluster hosts extremely strong cooling flow around solar masses year central galaxy cluster appears experiencing massive starburst formation around solar masses year suggests feedback source responsible preventing runaway cooling nearby cool-core clusters may yet fully established spt-clj2344- large starformation rate implies significant fraction stars central galaxy cluster may form accretion intracluster medium rather currently thought assembling entirely via mergers
