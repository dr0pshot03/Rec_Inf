erk/cdk5 axis controls diabetogenic actions ppar gamma
obesity-linked insulin resistance major precursor development type diabetes previous work shown phosphorylation ppar gamma peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma serine cydin-dependent kinase cdk5 stimulates diabetogenic gene expression adipose tissues inhibition modification key therapeutic mechanism anti-diabetic drugs bind ppar gamma thiazolidinediones ppar gamma partial agonists non-agonists better understanding importance obesity-linked ppar gamma phosphorylation created mice ablated cdk5 specifically adipose tissues mice paradoxical increase ppar gamma phosphorylation serine worsened insulin resistance unbiased proteomic studies show extracellular signal-regulated kinase erk kinases activated knockout animals show erk directly phosphorylates serine ppar gamma robust manner cdk5 suppresses erks direct action novel site map kinase/ erk kinase mek importantly pharmacological inhibition mek erk markedly improves insulin resistance obese wildtype ob/ob mice also completely reverses deleterious effects cdk5 ablation data show erk/cdk5 axis controls ppar gamma function suggest mek/erk inhibitors may hold promise treatment type diabetes
