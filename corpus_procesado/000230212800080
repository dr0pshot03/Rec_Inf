effects landscape corridors seed dispersal birds
habitat fragmentation threatens biodiversity disrupting dispersal mechanisms consequences disruption controversial primarily organisms difficult track examined effect habitat corridors long-distance dispersal seeds birds tested whether small-scale < meters movements birds scaled predict dispersal seeds across hundreds meters eight experimentally fragmented landscapes simulation model accurately predicted observed pattern seed rain revealed corridors functioned edge-following behavior birds study shows models based easily observed behaviors can scaled predict landscape-level processes
