motor skill learning requires active central myelination 
myelin-forming oligodendrocytes ols formed continuously healthy adult brain work study function late-forming cells myelin produce learning new motor skill juggling alters structure brains white matter contains many ols suggesting late-born ols might contribute motor learning consistent idea show production newly formed ols briefly accelerated mice learn new skill running complex wheel irregularly spaced rungs genetically manipulating transcription factor myelin regulatory factor ol precursors blocked production new ols adulthood without affecting preexisting ols myelin prevented mice mastering complex wheel thus generation new ols myelin important learning motor skills
