co-evolution transcriptional posttranslational cell-cycle regulation
dna microarray studies shown hundreds genes transcribed periodically mitotic cell cycle humans budding yeast fission yeast- plant arabidopsis thaliana show despite fact protein complexes involved process largely among eukaryotes regulation evolved considerably comparative analysis several large-scale data sets reveals although regulated subunits protein complex expressed just time action identity periodically expressed proteins differs significantly organisms moreover show changes transcriptional regulation co-evolved post-translational control independently several lineages loss gain cell-cycle-regulated transcription specific genes often mirrored changes phosphorylation proteins encode results indicate many different solutions evolved assembling molecular machines right time cell cycle involving transcriptional post-translational layers jointly control dynamics biological systems
