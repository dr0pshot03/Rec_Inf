critical role eosinophils allergic airways remodeling
features chronic asthma include airway hyperresponsiveness inflammatory infiltrates structural changes airways termed remodeling contribution eosinophils cells associated asthma allergy remains established show mice total ablation eosinophil lineage increases airway hyperresponsiveness mucus secretion similar observed wild-type mice eosinophil-deficient mice significantly protected peribronchiolar collagen deposition increases airway smooth muscle data suggest eosinophils contribute substantially airway remodeling obligatory allergen-induced lung dysfunction support important role eosinophil-targeted therapies chronic asthma
