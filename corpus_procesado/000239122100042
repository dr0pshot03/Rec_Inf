atom-by-atom analysis global downhill protein folding 
protein folding inherently complex process involving coordination intricate networks weak interactions stabilize native three-dimensional structures conventional paradigm simple protein structures assumed fold all-or-none process inaccessible experiment existing experimental methods therefore probe folding mechanisms indirectly widely used approach interprets changes protein stability and/or folding kinetics induced engineered mutations terms structure native protein addition limitations connecting energetics structure mutational methods significant experimental uncertainties unable map complex networks interactions contrast analytical theory predicts small barriers folding possibility downhill folding theoretical predictions confirmed experimentally recent years- including observation global downhill folding however key remaining question whether downhill folding can indeed lead high-resolution analysis protein folding processes show use nuclear magnetic resonance nmr downhill protein bbl escherichia coli unfolds atom atom starting defined three-dimensional structure thermal unfolding data backbone side-chain protons total provide detailed view structural events folding view confirms statistical nature folding exposes interplay hydrogen bonding hydrophobic forces backbone conformation side-chain entropy data also obtain map interaction network protein reveals source folding cooperativity approach can extended proteins marginal barriers less 3rt providing new tool study protein folding
