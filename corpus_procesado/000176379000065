place cells place recognition maintained direct entorhinal-hippocampal circuitry
place cells hippocampal area ca1 may receive positional information intrahippocampal associative network area ca3 directly entorhinal cortex determine whether direct entorhinal connections support spatial ring spatial memory removed input areas ca3 ca1 thus isolating ca1 area pyramidal cells isolated ca1 area developed sharp stable place fields rats isolated ca1 area showed normal acquisition associative hippocampal-dependent spatial recognition task spatial recall impaired results suggest hippocampus contains two functionally separable memory circuits: direct entorhinal-ca1 system sufficient recollection-based recognition memory recall depends intact ca3-ca1 connectivity
