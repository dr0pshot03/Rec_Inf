astrocyte-encoded positional cues maintain sensorimotor circuit integrity
astrocytes abundant cells central nervous system promote synapse formation help refine neural connectivity although allocated spatially distinct regional domains development unknown whether region-restricted astrocytes functionally heterogeneous show postnatal spinal cord astrocytes express several region-specific genes ventral astrocyte-encoded semaphorin 3a sema3a required proper motor neuron sensory neuron circuit organization loss astrocyte-encoded sema3a leads dysregulated alpha-motor neuron axon initial segment orientation markedly abnormal synaptic inputs selective death alpha adjacent gamma-motor neurons addition subset trka+ sensory afferents projects ectopic ventral positions findings demonstrate stable maintenance positional cue developing astrocytes influences multiple aspects sensorimotor circuit formation generally suggest regional astrocyte heterogeneity may help coordinate postnatal neural circuit refinement
