de novo design transmembrane zn2+-transporting four-helix bundle 
design functional membrane proteins first principles represents grand challenge chemistry structural biology report design membrane-spanning four-helical bundle transports first-row transition metal ions zn2+ co2+ ca2+ across membranes conduction path designed contain two di-metal binding sites bind negative cooperativity x-ray crystallography solid-state solution nuclear magnetic resonance indicate overall helical bundle formed two tightly interacting pairs helices form individual domains interact weakly along dynamic interface vesicle flux experiments show zn2+ ions diffuse concentration gradients protons antiported experiments illustrate feasibility designing membrane proteins predefined structural dynamic properties
