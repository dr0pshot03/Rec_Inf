fluidity water confined subnanometre films 
fluidity water confined geometries relevant processes ranging tribology protein folding molecular mobility pores slits extensively studied using variety approaches- studies liquid flow measured directly suggest viscosity aqueous electrolytes confined films thickness greater nm remains close bulk- behaviour similar non-associative organic liquids confined films thicker molecular layers observe effective viscosity water remains within factor three bulk value even confined films thickness range +/ +/ nm contrasts markedly behaviour organic solvents whose viscosity diverges confined films thinner molecular layers- attribute fundamentally different mechanisms solidification two cases non-associative liquids confinement promotes solidification suppressing translational freedom molecules- however case water confinement seems primarily suppress formation highly directional hydrogen-bonded networks associated freezing
