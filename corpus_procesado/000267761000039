dna sequence motifs structure-specific recognition separation carbon nanotubes 
single-walled carbon nanotubes swnts family molecules cylindrical shape different chiralities1 many fundamental studies technological applications2 swnts require population tubes identical chirality current syntheses provide swnt sorting problem-that separation synthetic mixture tubes individual single-chirality components-has attracted considerable attention recent years intense efforts far focused largely resulted solutions weaker version sorting problem: metal/semiconductor separation34 systematic general method purify every single-chirality species electronic type synthetic mixture swnts highly desirable task proven insurmountable date report method allows purification major single-chirality semiconducting species synthetic mixture sufficient yield fundamental studies application development designed effective search dna library similar size identified short dna sequences recognizes enables chromatographic purification particular nanotube species synthetic mixture recognition sequences exhibit periodic purine-pyrimidines pattern can undergo hydrogen-bonding form two-dimensional sheet fold selectively nanotubes well-ordered three-dimensional barrel propose ordered two-dimensional sheet three-dimensional barrel provide structural basis observed dna recognition swnts
