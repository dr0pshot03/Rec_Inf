topological versus chemical ordering network glasses intermediate extended length scales
atomic ordering network glasses length scales longer nearest-neighbour length scales long source controversy- detailed experimental information therefore necessary understand network properties fundamentals glass formation address problem investigating topological chemical ordering structurally disordered ax systems applying method isotopic substitution neutron diffraction glassy zncl2 system may regarded prototypical ionic network forming glass provided ion polarization effects taken account thus focus much attention- experiment show topological chemical ordering described two length scales distances greater nearest-neighbour length scales one associated intermediate range manifested appearance measured diffraction patterns first sharp diffraction peak angstrom- associated extended range shows ordering glass angstrom also find general features characteristic glassy gese2 prototypical covalently bonded network material results therefore offer structural insight length scales determine many important aspects supercooled liquid glass phenomenology
