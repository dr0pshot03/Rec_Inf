suppression star formation galaxy ngc starburst-driven molecular wind
under-abundance massive galaxies universe frequently attributed effect galactic winds- although ionized galactic winds readily observable expelled mass total mass flowing nuclear region likely atomic molecular phases- cooler ionized phases expanding molecular shells observed starburst systems ngc ref m refs may facilitate entrainment molecular gas wind although shell properties well constrained determining amount outflowing gas emerging shells connection gas ionized wind requires spatial resolution better parsecs coupled sensitivity wide range spatial scales combination hitherto available report observations ngc nearby starburst galaxy distance similar megaparsecs known possess wind- trace cool molecular wind parsec resolution resolution extraplanar molecular gas closely tracks ha filaments appears connected expanding molecular shells located starburst region observations allow us determine molecular outflow rate greater solar masses per year probably solar masses per year implies ratio mass-outflow rate star-formation rate least probably similar indicating starburst-driven wind limits star-formation activity final stellar content
