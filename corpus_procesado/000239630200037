card9 controls non-tlr signalling pathway innate anti-fungal immunity 
fungal infections increasing worldwide due marked rise immunodeficiencies including aids; however immune responses fungi poorly understood dectin major mammalian pattern recognition receptor fungal component zymosan dectin represents prototype innate non toll like receptors tlrs containing immunoreceptor tyrosine based activation motifs itams related adaptive antigen receptors identify card9 key transducer dectin signalling although dispensable tlr/ myd88 induced responses card9 controls dectin mediated myeloid cell activation cytokine production innate anti fungal immunity card9 couples bcl10 regulates bcl10 malt1 mediated nf kappa b activation induced zymosan yet card9 dispensable antigen receptor signalling uses carma1 link bcl10 malt1 thus results define novel innate immune pathway indicate evolutionarily distinct itam receptors innate adaptive immune cells use diverse adaptor proteins engage selectively conserved bcl10 malt1 module
