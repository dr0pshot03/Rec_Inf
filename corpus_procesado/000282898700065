hundreds variants clustered genomic loci biological pathways affect human height
common human traits diseases polygenic pattern inheritance: dna sequence variants many genetic loci influence phenotype genome-wide association gwa studies identified variants associated human traits typically explain small fractions phenotypic variation raising questions use studies using individuals show hundreds genetic variants least loci influence adult height highly heritable classic polygenic trait large number loci reveals patterns important implications genetic studies common human diseases traits first loci random instead enriched genes connected biological pathways p underlie skeletal growth defects p< second likely causal gene often located near strongly associated variant: loci containing known skeletal growth gene gene closest associated variant third least loci multiple independently associated variants suggesting allelic heterogeneity frequent feature polygenic traits comprehensive explorations already-discovered loci discover additional variants appreciable fraction associated loci may identified fourth associated variants enriched likely functional effects genes over-represented among variants alter amino-acid structure proteins expression levels nearby genes data explain approximately % phenotypic variation height estimate unidentified common variants similar effect sizes increase figure approximately % phenotypic variation approximately % heritable variation although additional approaches needed dissect genetic architecture polygenic human traits fully findings indicate gwa studies can identify large numbers loci implicate biologically relevant genes pathways
