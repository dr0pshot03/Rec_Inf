antagonistic actions msx1 osr2 pattern mammalian teeth single row 
mammals single-rowed dentitions whereas many nonmammalian vertebrates teeth multiple rows neither molecular mechanism regulating iterative tooth initiation restricting mammalian tooth development one row known found mice lacking transcription factor odd-skipped related osr2 develop supernumerary teeth lingual molars expansion odontogenic field osr2 expressed lingual-to-buccal gradient restricted expression bone morphogenetic protein bmp4 essential odontogenic signal developing tooth mesenchyme expansion odontogenic field osr2-deficient mice required msx1 feedback activator bmp4 expression findings suggest bmp4-msx1 pathway propagates mesenchymal activation sequential tooth induction spatial modulation pathway provides mechanism patterning vertebrate dentition
