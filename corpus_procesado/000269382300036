chemical structure molecule resolved atomic force microscopy
resolving individual atoms always ultimate goal surface microscopy scanning tunneling microscope images atomic-scale features surfaces resolving single atoms within adsorbed molecule remains great challenge tunneling current primarily sensitive local electron density states close fermi level demonstrate imaging molecules unprecedented atomic resolution probing short-range chemical forces use noncontact atomic force microscopy key step functionalizing microscopes tip apex suitable atomically well-defined terminations co molecules experimental findings corroborated ab initio density functional theory calculations comparison theory shows pauli repulsion source atomic resolution whereas van der waals electrostatic forces add diffuse attractive background
