transformation optics subwavelength control light
intuitive understanding light foundation ray approximation intimately connected vision far eyes concerned light behaves like stream particles look inside wavelength study properties plasmonic structures dimensions just nanometers tenth even hundredth wavelength visible light ray picture fails review concept transformation optics manipulates electric magnetic field lines rather rays can provide equally intuitive understanding subwavelength phenomena time can exact description level maxwells equations
