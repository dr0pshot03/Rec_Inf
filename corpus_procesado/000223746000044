epigenetic regulation translation reveals hidden genetic variation produce complex traits 
phenotypic plasticity exposure hidden genetic variation affect survival evolution new traits- contributing molecular mechanisms largely unknown single factor yeast prion [psi+] may exert profound effect [psi+] conserved protein-based genetic element formed change conformation function translation termination factor sup35p transmitted mother progeny curing cells [psi+] alters survival different growth conditions produces spectrum phenotypes different genetic backgrounds show examining three plausible explanations phenotypic diversity traits tested involved [psi+]-mediated read-through nonsense codons notably phenotypes analysed genetically complex genetic re-assortment frequently converted [psi+]-dependent phenotypes stable traits persisted absence [psi+] thus [psi+] provides temporary survival advantage diverse conditions increasing likelihood new traits will become fixed subsequent genetic change epigenetic mechanism globally affects relationship genotype phenotype [psi+] expands conceptual framework phenotypic plasticity provides one-step mechanism acquisition complex traits affords route genetic assimilation initially transient epigenetic traits
