chaos long-term experiment plankton community 
mathematical models predict species interactions competition predation can generate chaos1- however experimental demonstrations chaos ecology scarce limited simple laboratory systems short duration artificial species combinations9- present first experimental demonstration chaos long term experiment complex food web food web isolated baltic sea consisted bacteria several phytoplankton species herbivorous predatory zooplankton species detritivores food web cultured laboratory mesocosm sampled twice week days despite constant external conditions species abundances showed striking fluctuations several orders magnitude fluctuations displayed variety different periodicities attributed different species interactions food web population dynamics characterized positive lyapunov exponents similar magnitude species predictability limited time horizon days slightly longer local weather forecast hence results demonstrate species interactions food webs can generate chaos implies stability required persistence complex food webs long term prediction species abundances can fundamentally impossible
