sub-luminous type ia supernovae mergers equal-mass white dwarfs mass similar 9mcircle dot 
type ia supernovae thought result thermonuclear explosions carbon-oxygen white dwarf stars existing models generally explain observed properties exception sub-luminous 1991bg-like supernovae long suspected merger two white dwarfs give rise type ia event hitherto simulations failed produce explosion report simulation merger two equal-mass white dwarfs leads sub-luminous explosion although expense requiring single common-envelope phase component masses similar 9mcircle dot light curve broad synthesized spectra red colour low expansion velocities close observed sub-luminous 1991bg-like events although mass ratios can slightly less one still produce sub-luminous event masses range 83mcircle dot 9mcircle dot
