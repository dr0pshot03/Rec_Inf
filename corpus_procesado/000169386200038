overflow cold dense water nordic seas across greenland-scotland ridge atlantic ocean main source deep water north atlantic ocean flow also helps drive inflow warm saline surface water nordic seas faroe bank channel deepest path across ridge deep flow channel accounts one-third total overflow previous work demonstrated overflow become warmer less saline time show using direct measurements historical hydrographic data volume flux faroe bank channel overflow also decreased estimating volume flux conservatively rnd decrease least per cent relative reduction deep flow nordic seas compensated increased flow sources implies weakened global thermohaline circulation reduced inflow atlantic water nordic seas
