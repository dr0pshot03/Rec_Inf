sign change poissons ratio carbon nanotube sheets
materials shrink laterally like rubber band stretched poissons ratios positive likewise materials contract directions hydrostatically compressed decrease density stretched positive linear compressibilities found plane poissons ratio carbon nanotube sheets buckypaper can tuned positive negative mixing single walled multiwalled nanotubes density normalized sheet toughness strength modulus substantially increased mixing simple model predicts sign magnitude poissons ratio buckypaper relative ease nanofiber bending stretch explains poissons ratios ordinary writing paper positive much larger theory also explains negative plane poissons ratio associated large positive poissons ratio sheet thickness predicts hydrostatic compression can produce biaxial sheet expansion tunability poissons ratio can exploited design sheet derived composites artificial muscles gaskets chemical mechanical sensors
