human telomerase holoenzyme protein required cajal body localization telomere synthesis 
telomerase ribonucleoprotein rnp complex synthesizes telomere repeats tissue progenitor cells cancer cells active human telomerase consists least three principal subunits including telomerase reverse transcriptase telomerase rna terc dyskerin identify holoenzyme subunit tcab1 telomerase cajal body protein notably enriched cajal bodies nuclear sites rnp processing important telomerase function tcab1 associates active telomerase enzyme established telomerase components small cajal body rnas involved modifying splicing rnas depletion tcab1 using rna interference prevents terc associating cajal bodies disrupts telomerase telomere association abrogates telomere synthesis telomerase thus tcab1 controls telomerase trafficking required telomere synthesis human cancer cells
