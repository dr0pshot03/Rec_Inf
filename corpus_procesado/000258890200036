widespread changes protein synthesis induced micrornas 
animal micrornas mirnas regulate gene expression inhibiting translation and/ inducing degradation target messenger rnas unknown much translational control exerted mirnas genome wide scale used new proteomic approach measure changes synthesis several thousand proteins response mirna transfection endogenous mirna knockdown parallel quantified mrna levels using microarrays show single mirna can repress production hundreds proteins repression typically relatively mild number known features mirna binding site seed sequence also govern repression human protein synthesis report additional target sequence characteristics demonstrate addition downregulating mrna levels mirnas also directly repress translation hundreds genes finally data suggest mirna can direct indirect effects tune protein synthesis thousands genes
