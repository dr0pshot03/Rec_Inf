retrospective prospective coding predicted reward sensory thalamus
reward important shaping goal-directed behaviour- stimulus-reward associative learning organism can assess motivational value incoming stimuli basis past experience retrospective processing predict forthcoming rewarding events prospective processing- traditional role sensory thalamus relay current sensory information cortex rnd non-primary thalamic neurons respond reward-related events two ways early phasic responses occurred shortly onset stimuli depended sensory modality magnitudes resisted extinction correlated learning experience late responses gradually increased cue delay periods peaked just delivery reward responses independent sensory modality modulated value timing reward observations provide new evidence single thalamic neurons can code acquired significance sensory stimuli early responses retrospective coding predict upcoming reward value late responses prospective coding
