re-os isotopic evidence long-lived heterogeneity equilibration processes earths upper mantle 
geochemical composition earths upper mantle- thought reflect billion years melt extraction well recycling crustal materials fractionation rhenium osmium partial melting upper mantle makes re-os isotopic system well suited tracing extraction melt recycling resulting mid-ocean-ridge basalt report osmium isotope compositions osmium-rich platinum-group element alloys derived upper mantle osmium isotopic data form wide essentially gaussian distribution demonstrating respect re-os isotope systematics upper mantle extremely heterogeneous depleted enriched domains can apparently remain unequilibrated timescale billions years effective equilibration seems require high degrees partial melting occur mid-ocean ridges back-arc settings percolating melts enhance mobility osmium rhenium infer gaussian shape osmium isotope distribution signature random mixing process depleted enriched domains resulting plum pudding distribution upper mantle rather individual melt depletion events
