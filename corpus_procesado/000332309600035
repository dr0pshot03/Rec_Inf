lost transition: start-up glycolysis yields subpopulations nongrowing cells
cells need adapt dynamic environments yeast fail cope dynamic changes abundance glucose can undergo growth arrest show failure caused imbalanced reactions glycolysis essential pathway energy metabolism organisms imbalance arises largely fundamental design glycolysis making state glycolysis generic risk cells unbalanced glycolysis coexisted vital cells spontaneous nongenetic metabolic variability among individual cells determines state reached consequently cells survive transient atp adenosine -triphosphate hydrolysis futile cycling reduces probability reaching imbalanced state results reveal dynamic behavior glycolysis indicate cell fate can determined heterogeneity purely metabolic level
