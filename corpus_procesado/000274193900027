opposing microrna families regulate self-renewal mouse embryonic stem cells
embryonic stem cells escs differentiate must silence esc self-renewal program activate new tissue-specific programs absence dgcr8 dgcr8-/- protein required microrna mirna biogenesis mouse escs unable silence self-renewal show introduction let mirnas-a family mirnas highly expressed somatic cells-can suppress self-renewal dgcr8-/- wild-type escs introduction esc cell cycle regulating escc mirnas dgcr8-/- escs blocks capacity let suppress self-renewal profiling bioinformatic analyses show let inhibits whereas escc mirnas indirectly activate numerous self-renewal genes furthermore inhibition let family promotes de-differentiation somatic cells induced pluripotent stem cells together findings show escc let mirnas act common pathways alternatively stabilize self-renewing versus differentiated cell fates
