genome-wide association study indicates two novel resistance loci severe malaria
malaria causes approximately one million fatalities per year mostly among african children although highlighted strong protective effect sickle-cell trait full impact human genetics resistance disease remains largely unexplored genome-wide association gwa studies designed unravel relevant genetic variants comprehensively however malaria infectious diseases studies partly successful identify two previously unknown loci associated severe falciparum malaria patients controls ghana west africa applied gwa approach diverse clinical syndromes severe falciparum malaria thereby targeting human genetic variants influencing step complex pathogenesis disease one loci identified chromosome 1q32 within atp2b4 gene encodes main calcium pump erythrocytes host cells pathogenic stage malaria parasites second indicated intergenic single nucleotide polymorphism chromosome 16q22 possibly linked neighbouring gene encoding tight-junction protein marveld3 protein expressed endothelial cells might therefore role microvascular damage caused endothelial adherence parasitized erythrocytes also confirmed previous reports protective effects sickle-cell trait blood group o-o-o- findings underline potential gwa approach provide candidates development control measures infectious diseases humans
