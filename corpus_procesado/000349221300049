structural insight tight junction disassembly clostridium perfringens enterotoxin
c-terminal region clostridium perfringens enterotoxin c-cpe can bind specific claudins resulting disintegration tight junctions tjs increase paracellular permeability across epithelial cell sheets present structure mammalian claudin complex c-cpe angstrom resolution structure shows c-cpe forms extensive hydrophobic hydrophilic interactions two extracellular segments claudin- claudin-/c-cpe complex shows density short extracellular helix critical claudins assemble tj strands helix displacement may thus underlie c-cpe-mediated disassembly tjs
