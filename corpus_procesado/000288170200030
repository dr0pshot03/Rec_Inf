wiring specificity direction-selectivity circuit retina 
proper connectivity neurons essential implementation algorithms used neural computations detection directed motion retina analysis neuronal connectivity possible electron microscopy technological limitations impeded acquisition high-resolution data large enough scale show using serial block-face electron microscopy two-photon calcium imaging dendrites mouse starburst amacrine cells make highly specific synapses direction-selective ganglion cells depending ganglion cells preferred direction findings indicate structural wiring asymmetry contributes computation direction selectivity nature asymmetry supports models direction selectivity rules others also puts constraints developmental mechanisms behind formation synaptic connections study demonstrates otherwise intractable neurobiological questions can addressed combining functional imaging analysis neuronal connectivity using large-scale electron microscopy
