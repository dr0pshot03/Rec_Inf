non-cell-autonomous driving tumour growth supports sub-clonal heterogeneity 
cancers arise process somatic evolution can result substantial sub-clonal heterogeneity within tumours mechanisms responsible coexistence distinct sub-clones biological consequences coexistence remain poorly understood used mouse xenograft model investigate impact sub-clonal heterogeneity tumour phenotypes competitive expansion individual clones found tumour growth can driven minor cell subpopulation enhances proliferation cells within tumour overcoming environmental constraints yet can outcompeted faster proliferating competitors resulting tumour collapse developed mathematical modelling framework identify rules underlying generation intra-tumour clonal heterogeneity found non-cell-autonomous driving tumour growth together clonal interference stabilizes sub-clonal heterogeneity thereby enabling inter-clonal interactions can lead new phenotypic traits
