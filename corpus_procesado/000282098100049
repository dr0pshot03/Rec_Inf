dendritic discrimination temporal input sequences cortical neurons
detection discrimination temporal sequences fundamental brain function underlies perception cognition motor output applying patterned two-photon glutamate uncaging found single dendrites cortical pyramidal neurons exhibit sensitivity sequence synaptic activation sensitivity encoded local dendritic calcium signals somatic depolarization leading sequence-selective spike output mechanism involves dendritic impedance gradients nonlinear synaptic n-methyl-d-aspartate receptor activation generalizable dendrites different neuronal types enables discrimination patterns delivered single dendrite well patterns distributed randomly across dendritic tree pyramidal cell dendrites can thus act processing compartments detection synaptic sequences thereby implementing fundamental cortical computation
