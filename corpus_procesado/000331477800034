protein-guided rna dynamics early ribosome assembly
assembly 30s ribosomes requires precise addition proteins 16s ribosomal rna early binding proteins change ribosomal rna structure later proteins may join complex poorly understood use single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer fret observe real-time encounters escherichia coli ribosomal protein s4 16s domain rna early stage 30s assembly dynamic initial s4-rna complexes pass stable non-native intermediate converting native complex showing non-native structures can offer low free-energy path protein-rna recognition three-colour fret molecular dynamics simulations reveal s4 changes frequency direction rna helix motions guiding conformational switch enforces hierarchy protein addition protein-guided dynamics offer alternative explanation induced fit rna-protein complexes
