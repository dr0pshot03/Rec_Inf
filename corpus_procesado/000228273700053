antigen recognition determinants gamma delta t cell receptors
molecular basis gamma delta t cell receptor tcr recognition poorly understood analyze tcr sequences natural gamma delta t cell population specific major histocompatibility complex class ib molecule t22 find t22 recognition correlates strongly somatically recombined tcr delta complementarity-determining region cdr3 motif derived germ line-encoded residues sequence diversity around residues modulates tcr ligand-binding affinities whereas v gene usage correlates mainly tissue origin results show antigen-specific gamma delta tcr repertoire can generated high frequency suggest gamma delta t cells recognize limited number antigens
