evidence spin-charge separation quasi-one-dimensional organic conductors retracted article see vol pg 
interacting conduction electrons usually described within fermi-liquid theory states spite strong interactions low-energy excitations electron-like quasiparticles charge spin recent years tremendous interest conducting systems fermi liquids motivated observation highly anomalous metallic states various materials notably copper oxide superconductors non-fermi-liquid behaviour generic one-dimensional interacting electron systems predicted luttinger liquids one key properties spin-charge separation: instead quasiparticles collective excitations charge spin spin charge formed move independently different velocities however experimental confirmation spin-charge separation remains challenge report experiments probing charge heat current quasi-one-dimensional conductors-the organic bechgaard salts- found charge spin excitations distinctly different thermal conductivities gives strong evidence spin-charge separation spin excitations much larger thermal conductivity charge excitations indicates coupling charge excitations lattice important
