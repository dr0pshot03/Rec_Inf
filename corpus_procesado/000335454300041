nrros negatively regulates reactive oxygen species host defence autoimmunity 
reactive oxygen species ros produced phagocytes essential host defence bacterial fungal infections individuals defective ros production machinery develop chronic granulomatous disease conversely excessive ros can cause collateral tissue damage inflammatory processes therefore needs tightly regulated describe protein termed negative regulator ros nrros limits ros generation phagocytes inflammatory responses nrros expression phagocytes can repressed inflammatory signals nrros-deficient phagocytes produce increased ros upon inflammatory challenges mice lacking nrros phagocytes show enhanced bactericidal activity escherichia coli listeria monocytogenes conversely mice develop severe experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis owing oxidative tissue damage central nervous system mechanistically nrros localized endoplasmic reticulum directly interactswith nascent nox2 also known gp91phox encoded cybb monomer one membrane-bound subunits nadph oxidase complex facilitates degradation nox2 endoplasmic-reticulum-associated degradation pathway thus nrros provides hitherto undefined mechanism regulating ros prodution-one enables phagocytes produce higher amounts ros required control invading pathogens minimizing unwanted collateral tissue damage
