cetz tubulin-like proteins control archaeal cell shape 
tubulin major component eukaryotic cytoskeleton controlling cell shape structure dynamics whereas bacterial homologue ftsz establishes cytokinetic ring constricts cell division12 different roles tubulin ftsz evolved unknown studying archaea may provide clues organisms share characteristics eukarya bacteria3 report structure function proteins distinct family related tubulin ftsz named cetz co-exists ftsz many archaea cetz x-ray crystal structures showed ftsz/tubulin superfamily fold one crystal form contained sheets protofilaments suggesting structural role however inactivation cetz proteins haloferax volcanii affect cell division instead cetz1 required differentiation irregular plate-shaped cells rod-shaped cell type essential normal swimming motility cetz1 formed dynamic cytoskeletal structures vivo relating capacity remodel cell envelope direct rod formation cetz2 also implicated h volcanii cell shape control findings expand known roles ftsz/tubulin superfamily include archaeal cell shape dynamics suggesting cytoskeletal role might predate eukaryotic cell evolution support premise major function microbial rod shape facilitate swimming
