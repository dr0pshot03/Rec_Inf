cassini discovers kinematic spiral ring around saturn 
since time voyager flybys saturn saturns eccentric f ring known accompanied either side faint strands material new cassini observations show strands initially interpreted concentric ring segments fact connected form single one-arm trailing spiral winding least three times around saturn spiral rotates around saturn orbital motion constituent particles structure likely result differential orbital motion stretching initial cloud particles scattered dense core f ring different scenarios formation implying ringlet-satellite interactions explored recently discovered moon candidate s/ s6 orbit crosses f-ring core intersection spiral ring suggests dynamical connection s/ s6 spiral
