disruption histone methylation developing sperm impairs offspring health transgenerationally
fathers lifetime experiences can transmitted offspring affect health development however mechanisms underlying paternal epigenetic transmission unclear unlike somatic cells nucleosomes sperm function epigenetic inheritance unknown generated transgenic mice overexpression histone h3 lysine h3k4 demethylase kdm1a also known lsd1 spermatogenesis reduced h3k4 dimethylation sperm kdm1a overexpression one generation severely impaired development survivability offspring defects persisted transgenerationally absence kdm1a germline expression associated altered rna profiles sperm offspring show epigenetic inheritance aberrant development can initiated histone demethylase activity developing sperm without changes dna methylation cpg-rich regions
