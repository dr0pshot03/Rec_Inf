comparison human genetic sequence-based physical maps
recombination exchange information two homologous chromosomes meiosis rate recombination per nucleotide profoundly affects evolution chromosomal segments calculated comparing genetic physical maps human physical maps constructed using cytogenetics overlapping dna clones radiation hybrids ultimate far accurate physical map actual nucleotide sequence completion draft human genomic sequence provides us best opportunity yet compare genetic physical maps describe estimates female male sex-average recombination rates % genome recombination rates varied greatly along chromosome least centimorgans per megabase cm mb- among several sequence marker parameters tested relative marker position along metacentric chromosomes males correlated strongly recombination rate identified several chromosomal regions mb length particularly low deserts high jungles recombination rates linkage disequilibrium much common extended greater distances deserts jungles
