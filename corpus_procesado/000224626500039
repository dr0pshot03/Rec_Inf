cognitive memory: cellular network machineries top-down control 
brain-wide distributed network orchestrates cognitive memorizing remembering explicit memory ie memory facts events network initially identified humans systematically investigated molecular/genetic single-unit lesion imaging studies animals types memory identified humans extended animals episodic-like event memory semantic-like fact memory unique configurational association environmental stimuli behavioral context likely basis episodic-like memory depends neural circuits medial temporal lobe whereas memory traces representing repeated associations likely basis semantic-like memory consolidated domain-specific regions temporal cortex regions reactivated remembering contribute contents memory two types retrieval signal reach cortical representations one runs frontal cortex active effortful retrieval top-down signal spreads backward medial temporal lobe automatic retrieval sending top-down signal temporal cortex frontal regions manipulate organize to-be-remembered information devise strategies retrieval also monitor outcome dissociated frontal regions making functionally separate contributions challenge understand hierarchical interactions multiple cortical areas correlational analysis also interventional study demonstrating causal necessity direction causality
