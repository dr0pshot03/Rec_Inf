disentangling type diabetes metformin treatment signatures human gut microbiota 
recent years several associations common chronic human disorders altered gut microbiome composition function reported reports treatment regimens controlled conclusions thus confounded effects various drugs microbiota may obscure microbial causes protective factors diagnostically relevant signals study addresses disease drug signatures human gut microbiome type diabetes mellitus t2d two previous quantitative gut metagenomics studies t2d patients unstratified treatment yielded divergent conclusions regarding associated gut microbial dysbiosis show using available human gut metagenomes antidiabetic medication confounds results analyse detail effects widely used antidiabetic drug metformin provide support microbial mediation therapeutic effects metformin short-chain fatty acid production well potential microbiota-mediated mechanisms behind known intestinal adverse effects form relative increase abundance escherichia species controlling metformin treatment report unified signature gut microbiome shifts t2d depletion butyrate-producing taxa turn cause functional microbiome shifts part alleviated metformin-induced changes overall present study emphasizes need disentangle gut microbiota signatures specific human diseases medication
