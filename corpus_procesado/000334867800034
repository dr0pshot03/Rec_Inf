discovery brainwide neural-behavioral maps via multiscale unsupervised structure learning 
single nervous system can generate many distinct motor patterns identifying neurons circuits control behaviors laborious piecemeal process usually one observer-defined behavior time present fundamentally different approach neuron-behavior mapping optogenetically activated identified neuron lines drosophila larvae tracked behavioral responses animals application multiscale unsupervised structure learning methods behavioral data enabled us identify discrete statistically distinguishable observer-unbiased behavioral phenotypes mapping neural lines behaviors evoke provides behavioral reference atlas neuron subsets covering large fraction larval neurons atlas starting point connectivity activity-mapping studies investigate mechanisms neurons mediate diverse behaviors
