bose-einstein condensation microelectronic chip 
although bose-einstein condensates- ultracold atoms experimentally realizable several years formation manipulation still impose considerable technical challenges all-optical technique enables faster production bose-einstein condensates recently reported demonstrate formation condensate can greatly simplified using microscopic magnetic trap chip achieve bose-einstein condensation inside single vapour cell magneto-optical trap little ms-more factor ten faster typical experiments factor three faster all-optical technique coherent matter wave emitted normal chip surface trapped atoms released free fall alternatively couple condensate atomic conveyor belt used transport condensed cloud nondestructively macroscopic distance parallel chip surface possibility manipulating laser-like coherent matter waves integrated atom-optical system holds promise applications interferometry holography microscopy atom lithography quantum information processing
