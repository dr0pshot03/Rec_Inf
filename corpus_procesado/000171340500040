bose-einstein condensation microelectronic chip 
although bose-einstein condensates1- ultracold atoms experimentally realizable several years formation manipulation still impose considerable technical challenges all-optical technique4 enables faster production bose-einstein condensates recently reported demonstrate formation condensate can greatly simplified using microscopic magnetic trap chip5 achieve bose-einstein condensation inside single vapour cell magneto-optical trap little ms-more factor ten faster typical experiments factor three faster all-optical technique4 coherent matter wave emitted normal chip surface trapped atoms released free fall; alternatively couple condensate atomic conveyor belt6 used transport condensed cloud nondestructively macroscopic distance parallel chip surface possibility manipulating laser-like coherent matter waves integrated atom-optical system holds promise applications interferometry holography microscopy atom lithography quantum information processing7
