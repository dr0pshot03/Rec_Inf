role carbon dioxide onset antarctic glaciation 
earths modern climate characterized polar ice sheets large equator-to-pole temperature gradients rooted environmental changes promoted antarctic glaciation similar million years ago onset antarctic glaciation reflects critical tipping point earths climate provides framework investigating role atmospheric carbon dioxide co2 major climatic change previously published records alkenone-based co2 high-and low-latitude ocean localities suggested co2 increased glaciation contradiction theory investigate alkenone records demonstrate antarctic subantarctic data overestimate atmospheric co2 levels biasing long-term trends results show co2 declined antarctic glaciation support substantial co2 decrease primary agent forcing antarctic glaciation consistent model-derived co2 thresholds
