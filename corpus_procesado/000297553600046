role carbon dioxide onset antarctic glaciation 
earths modern climate characterized polar ice sheets large equator-to-pole temperature gradients rooted environmental changes promoted antarctic glaciation similar million years ago onset antarctic glaciation reflects critical tipping point earths climate provides framework investigating role atmospheric carbon dioxide co major climatic change previously published records alkenone-based co high-and low-latitude ocean localities suggested co increased glaciation contradiction theory investigate alkenone records demonstrate antarctic subantarctic data overestimate atmospheric co levels biasing long-term trends results show co declined antarctic glaciation support substantial co decrease primary agent forcing antarctic glaciation consistent model-derived co thresholds
