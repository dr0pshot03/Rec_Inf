millennial orbital-scale changes east asian monsoon past years 
high resolution speleothem records china provided insights factors control strength east asian monsoon- understanding factors remains incomplete however owing gaps record monsoon history past two interglacial glacial cycles particular missing sections hampered ability test ideas orbital scale controls monsoon- causes millennial scale events relationships changes monsoon climate regions present absolute dated oxygen isotope record sanbao cave central china completes chinese-cave-based record strength east asian monsoon covers past years record dominated -year long cycles synchronous within dating errors summer insolation degrees n ref supporting idea tropical/ subtropical monsoons respond dominantly directly changes northern hemisphere summer insolation orbital timescales cycles punctuated millennial scale strong-summer-monsoon events chinese interstadials new record allows us identify complete series events past two interglacial glacial cycles duration decreases frequency increases glacial build last penultimate glacial periods indicating ice sheet size affects character pacing ages events exceptionally well constrained may thus serve benchmarks correlating calibrating climate records
