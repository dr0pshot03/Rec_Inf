early developmental arrest mammalian limbs lacking hoxa/hoxd gene function
vertebrate hoxa hoxd cluster genes required proper limb development- however early lethality compensation redundancy made full assessment function difficult- describe mice lacking hoxa hoxd functions forelimbs show limbs arrested early developmental patterning display severe truncations distal elements partly owing absence sonic hedgehog expression results indicate evolutionary recruitment hox gene function growing appendages might crucial implementing hedgehog signalling subsequently leading distal extension tetrapod appendages accordingly mutant limbs may reminiscent ancestral trunk extension related proposed arthropods
