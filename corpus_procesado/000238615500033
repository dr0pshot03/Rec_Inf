asymmetric symmetric stem-cell divisions development cancer
much made idea asymmetric cell division defining characteristic stem cells enables simultaneously perpetuate self-renew generate differentiated progeny yet many stem cells can divide symmetrically particularly expanding number development injury thus asymmetric division necessary stem-cell identity rather tool stem cells can use maintain appropriate numbers progeny facultative use symmetric asymmetric divisions stem cells may key adaptation crucial adult regenerative capacity
