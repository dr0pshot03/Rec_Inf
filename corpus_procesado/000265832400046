host inhibition bacterial virulence effector triggers immunity infection 
plant pathogenic bacteria secrete effector proteins attack host signaling machinery suppress immunity effectors can recognized hosts leading immunity one effector avrptob pseudomonas syringae degrades host protein kinases tomato fen e3 ligase domain pto kinase highly related fen recognizes avrptob conjunction resistance protein prf show pto resistant avrptob-mediated degradation inactivates e3 ligase domain avrptob ubiquitinated fen within catalytic cleft leading breakdown loss associated prf protein pto avoids phosphorylating inactivating avrptob e3 domain thus inactivation pathogen virulence molecule one mechanism plants resist disease
