serial time-encoded amplified imaging real-time observation fast dynamic phenomena 
ultrafast real-time optical imaging indispensable tool studying dynamical events shock waves chemical dynamics living cells neural activity laser surgery- microfluidics however conventional ccds charge-coupled devices complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor cmos counterparts incapable capturing fast dynamical processes high sensitivity resolution due part technological limitation-it takes time read data sensor arrays also fundamental compromise sensitivity frame rate high frame rates fewer photons collected frame-a problem affects nearly optical imaging systems report imaging method overcomes limitations offers frame rates least times faster conventional ccds technique maps two-dimensional 2d image serial time-domain data stream simultaneously amplifies image optical domain capture entire 2d image using single-pixel photodetector achieve net image amplification db factor overcomes compromise sensitivity frame rate without resorting cooling high-intensity illumination proof concept perform continuous real-time imaging frame speed ns frame rate mhz shutter speed ps also demonstrate real-time imaging microfluidic flow phase-explosion effects occur laser ablation
