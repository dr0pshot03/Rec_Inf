high-frequency secondary event parkfield earthquake
using seismic records magnitude parkfield earthquake identified burst high-frequency seismic radiation occurred kilometers northwest hypocenter seconds rupture initiation imaged event three dimensions using waveform back-projection method well timing distinct arrivals visible many seismograms high-frequency event located near south edge large slip patch seen seismic geodetic inversions indicating slip may grown abruptly point time history obtained full-waveform back projection suggests rupture velocity kilometers per second energy estimates subevent together long-period slip inversions indicate lower average stress drop northern part parkfield earthquake compared region near hypocenter agreement stress-drop estimates obtained small-magnitude aftershocks
