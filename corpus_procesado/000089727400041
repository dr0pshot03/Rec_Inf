direct detection pulsations cepheid star xi gem independent calibration period-luminosity relation
cepheids class variable pulsating stars whose absolute luminosities related simple manner pulsational periods measuring period using `period-luminosity relationship astronomers can use observed visual brightness determine distance star stars luminous can observed galaxies therefore can used help determine expansion rate universe hubble constant calibration period-luminosity relation necessary first step small number sufficiently nearby cepheids forced use number indirect means associated systematic uncertainties present distance cepheid zeta geminorum determined using direct measurement optical interferometer changes diameter pulsates within uncertainty per cent distance agreement previous indirect determinations planned improvements instrument will allow us calibrate directly period-luminosity relation better per cent
