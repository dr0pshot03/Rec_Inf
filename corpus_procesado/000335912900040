nmr spectroscopy native vitro tissues implicates polyadp ribose biomineralization 
nuclear magnetic resonance nmr spectroscopy useful determine molecular structure tissues grown vitro fidelity relative native tissue can established use multidimensional nmr spectra animal vitro model tissues fingerprints respective molecular structures allowing us compare intact tissues atomic length scales obtain spectra animal tissues developed heavy mouse enriched % nmr-active isotopes carbon- nitrogen- resulting spectra allowed us refine vitro model developing bone probe detailed structure identification unexpected molecule polyadenosine diphosphate ribose may implicated calcification bone matrix illustrates analytical power approach
