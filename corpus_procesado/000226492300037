grain boundary decohesion impurity segregation nickel-sulfur system 
sulfur-induced embrittlement nickel long wrapped mystery sulfur weakens grain boundaries nickel critical intergranular sulfur concentration required first-principles calculations found large grain-boundary expansion caused short-range overlap repulsion among densely segregated neighboring sulfur atoms expansion results drastic grain-boundary decohesion reduces grain-boundary tensile strength one order magnitude decohesion may directly cause embrittlement critical sulfur concentration decohesion agrees well experimental data embrittlement
