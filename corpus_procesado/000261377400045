optical absorption radiative thermal conductivity silicate perovskite gigapascals
mantle convection plate tectonics driven heat flow earths core surface radiative contribution heat transport usually assumed negligible report near infrared optical absorption spectra silicate perovskite main constituent lower mantle gigapascals silicate perovskite remains quite transparent pressures core mantle boundary estimates radiative thermal conductivity derived spectra approach watts meter- kelvin- lowermost mantle conditions implying heat conduction dominated radiation however increase radiative conductivity temperature t less pronounced expected t dependency
