combinatorial temporal patterning progenitors expands neural diversity 
human outer subventricular zone osvz neural progenitors drosophila type ii neuroblasts generate intermediate neural progenitors inps populate adult cerebral cortex central complex respectively unknown whether inps simply expand also diversify neural cell types show drosophila inps sequentially generate distinct neural subtypes inps sequentially express dichaete grainy head eyeless transcription factors transcription factors required production distinct neural subtypes moreover parental type ii neuroblasts also sequentially express transcription factors generate different neuronal/glial progeny time providing second temporal identity axis conclude neuroblast inp temporal patterning axes act together generate increased neural diversity within adult central complex osvz progenitors may use similar mechanisms increase neural diversity human brain
