neuronal representation pitch primate auditory cortex 
pitch perception critical identifying segregating auditory objects especially context music speech perception pitch unique humans experimentally demonstrated several animal species pitch subjective attribute sounds fundamental frequency f determined temporal regularity average repetition rate acoustic waveform spectrally dissimilar sounds can pitch share common f even acoustic energy f removed missing fundamental pitch still perceived despite importance hearing pitch represented cerebral cortex unknown show existence neurons auditory cortex marmoset monkeys respond pure tones missing fundamental harmonic complex sounds f providing neural correlate pitch constancy pitch-selective neurons located restricted low-frequency cortical region near anterolateral border primary auditory cortex consistent location pitch-selective area identified recent imaging studies humans
