wing-assisted incline running evolution flight
flapping wings galliform birds routinely used produce aerodynamic forces oriented toward substrate enhance hindlimb traction document behavior natural laboratory settings adult birds fully capable aerial flight preferentially employ wing-assisted incline running wair rather flying reach elevated refuges cliffs trees boulders day hatching attaining sustained aerial flight developing ground birds use wair enhance locomotor performance improved foot traction ultimately permitting vertical running wair provides insight behaviors observable living birds possible role incipient wings feathered theropod dinosaurs offers previously unstudied explanation evolution avian flight
