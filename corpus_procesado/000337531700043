genomic landscape underlying phenotypic integrity face gene flow crows 
importance extent mode interspecific gene flow evolution species long debated characterization genomic differentiation classic example hybridization all-black carrion crows gray-coated hooded crows identified genome-wide introgression extending far beyond morphological hybrid zone gene expression divergence concentrated pigmentation genes expressed gray versus black feather follicles small number narrow genomic islands exhibited resistance gene flow one prominent genomic region < megabases harbored fixed differences million single-nucleotide polymorphisms total linking genes involved pigmentation visual perception-a genomic signal reflecting color-mediated prezygotic isolation thus localized genomic selection can cause marked heterogeneity introgression landscapes maintaining phenotypic divergence
