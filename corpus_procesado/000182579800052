cooperation rna polymerase molecules transcription elongation
transcription elongation responsible rapid synthesis rna chains thousands nucleotides vivo contrast single round transcription performed vitro frequently interrupted pauses arrests drastically reduce elongation rate yield full-length transcript demonstrate transcriptional delays disappear one rna polymerase rnap molecule initiates promoter anti-arrest anti-pause effects trailing rnap due forward translocation leading backtracked complexes cooperation rnap molecules links rate elongation rate initiation explains elongation still fast processive vivo even without anti-arrest factors
