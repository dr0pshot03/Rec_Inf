stem cell division regulated microrna pathway
one key characteristics stem cells capacity divide long periods time environment cells quiescent therefore critical question stem cell biology stem cells escape cell division stop signals report necessity microrna mirna pathway- proper control germline stem cell gsc division drosophila melanogaster analysis gscs mutant dicer dcr- double-stranded rnaseiii essential mirna biogenesis revealed marked reduction rate germline cyst production dcr mutant gscs exhibit normal identity defective cell cycle control basis cell cycle markers genetic interactions conclude dcr mutant gscs delayed g1 s transition dependent cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor dacapo suggesting mirnas required stem cells bypass normal g1/s checkpoint hence mirna pathway might part mechanism makes stem cells insensitive environmental signals normally stop cell cycle g1/s transition
