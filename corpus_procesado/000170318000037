generation characterization fairly stable triplet carbene 
molecules held together covalent bonds-electron pairs jointly shared two atoms linked bond free radicals contrast least one unpaired electron case carbon-based radicals carbon atom radical centre longer makes four bonds atoms normal tetravalent state presence unpaired electrons renders radicals highly reactive normally occur transient intermediates chemical reactions discovery gomberg triphenylmethyl first relatively stable free radical containing central trivalent carbon atom illustrated radicals suitable geometrical electronic structures can stable compounds containing divalent carbon atom uses two four valence electrons bonding usually less stable gomberg-type radicals trivalent carbon- although role so-called carbenes chemical reactions long postulated unambiguously identified 1950s recently stable carbenes prepared singlet state molecules- two nonbonding valence electrons paired means radicals carbenes second possible electronic state triplet state radicals: two nonbonding electrons parallel spins occupy different orbitals report preparation characterization triplet carbene whose half-life minutes room temperature shows significantly stable previously observed triplet carbenes-
