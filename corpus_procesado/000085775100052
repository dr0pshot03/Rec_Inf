delayed activation paternal genome seed development 
little known timing maternal-to-zygotic transition seed development flowering plants plant embryos can develop somatic cells microspores maternal contributions considered crucial early embryogensis early-acting embryo-lethal mutants arabidopsis including emb30/gnom affects first zygotic division fuelled perception maternal paternal genomes active immediately fertilization show none paternally inherited alleles loci tested expressed early seed development arabidopsis genes expressed later stages paternally inherited allele becomes active three four days fertilization genes tested involved various processes distributed throughout genome indicating paternal genome may initially silenced findings corroborated genetic studies showing emb30/gnom maternal-effect phenotype paternally rescuable addition zygotic lethality thus contrary previous interpretations early embryo endosperm development mainly maternal control
