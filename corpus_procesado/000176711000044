alternative flavin-dependent mechanism thymidylate synthesis 
although deoxythymidylate provided directly ribonucleotide reductase gene encoding thymidylate synthase thya absent genomes large number nonsymbiotic microbes show thyx thy1 proteins previously unknown function form large distinct class thymidylate synthases thyx wide sporadic phylogenetic distribution almost exclusively limited microbial genomes lacking thya thyx thya use different reductive mechanisms thyx activity dependent reduced flavin nucleotides findings reveal complexity evolution thymidine present-day dna thyx proteins found many pathogenic microbes present previously uncharacterized target antimicrobial compounds
