ahr sensing bacterial pigments regulates antibacterial defence
aryl hydrocarbon receptor ahr highly conserved ligand-dependent transcription factor senses environmental toxins endogenous ligands thereby inducing detoxifying enzymes modulating immune cell differentiation responses hypothesized ahr evolved sense environmental pollutants also microbial insults characterized bacterial pigmented virulence factors namely phenazines pseudomonas aeruginosa naphthoquinone phthiocol mycobacterium tuberculosis ligands ahr upon ligand binding ahr activation leads virulence factor degradation regulated cytokine chemokine production relevance ahr host defence underlined heightened susceptibility ahr-deficient mice p aeruginosa m tuberculosis thus demonstrate ahr senses distinct bacterial virulence factors controls antibacterial responses supporting previously unidentified role ahr intracellular pattern recognition receptor identify bacterial pigments new class pathogen-associated molecular patterns
