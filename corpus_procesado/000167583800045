twisted gastrulation can function bmp antagonist
bone morphogenetic proteins bmps including fly homologue decapentaplegic dpp important regulators early vertebrate invertebrate dorsal-ventral development- evolutionarily conserved bmp regulatory mechanism operates fly fish frog mouse control dorsal-ventral axis determination several secreted factors including bmp antagonist chordin/short gastrulation sog- modulate activity bmps drosophila twisted gastrulation tsg also involved dorsal-ventral patterning- yet mechanism function unclear report characterization vertebrate tsg homologues show tsg can block bmp function xenopus embryonic explants inhibits several ventral markers whole-frog embryos tsg binds directly bmps forms ternary complex chordin bmps coexpression tsg chordin leads efficient inhibition bmp activity ectodermal explants unlike known bmp antagonists however tsg also reduces several anterior markers late developmental stages data suggest tsg can function bmp inhibitor xenopus furthermore tsg may additional functions frog embryogenesis
