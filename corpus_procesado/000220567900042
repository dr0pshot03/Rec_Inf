molybdenum isotope evidence widespread anoxia mid-proterozoic oceans 
much dissolved oxygen present mid-proterozoic oceans billion years ago debated vigorously one model argues oxygenation oceans soon initial rise atmospheric oxygen similar to23 billion years ago recent evidence h2s mid-proterozoic marine basins suggests however deep ocean remained anoxic much later new molybdenum isotope data modern ancient sediments indicate expanded anoxia mid-proterozoic compared present-day ocean consequently oxygenation deep oceans may lagged atmosphere billion years
