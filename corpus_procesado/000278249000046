folding cooperativity protein controlled chain topology
three-dimensional structures proteins often show modular architecture comprised discrete structural regions domains cooperative communication regions important catalysis regulation efficient folding lack coupling implicated formation fibrils misfolding pathologies different structural regions protein communicate contribute proteins overall energetics folding however still poorly understood use single-molecule optical tweezers approach induce selective unfolding particular regions t4 lysozyme monitor effect regions directly acted force investigate topological organization protein order structural elements along sequence affects coupling folding cooperativity domains probe status regions directly subjected force determine free energy changes mechanical unfolding using crooks fluctuation theorem pull topological variants circular permutants find topological organization polypeptide chain critically determines folding cooperativity domains thus parts folding/unfolding landscape explored speculate proteins may evolved select certain topologies increase coupling regions avoid areas landscape lead kinetic trapping misfolding
