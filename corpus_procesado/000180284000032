quantum phase transition organic charge-transfer complexes 
phase transition organic charge-transfer complex originates neutral-ionic valence instability can tuned toward zero kelvin use external pressure chemical modi cation control parameter phase diagram observed dielectric behaviors typical quantum paraelectricity yet zero-kelvin transition point namely quantum critical point accompanies large quantum fluctuation molecular charge demonstrated molecular vibrational mode spectra result indicates pi-electron transfer donor acceptor molecules coupled zero-point lattice dynamics around quantum critical point
