selection bias heterosexual hiv transmission bottleneck 
heterosexual transmission hiv typically results one genetic variant establishing systemic infection compared linked transmission pairs amino acid sequences encoded non-envelope genes viruses partners demonstrate selection bias transmission residues predicted confer increased vivo fitness viruses newly infected immunologically naive recipient although tempered transmission risk factors donor viral load genital inflammation recipient gender selection bias provides overall transmission advantage viral quasispecies dominated viruses high vivo fitness thus preventative therapeutic approaches even marginally reduce viral fitness may lower overall transmission rates offer long-term benefits even upon successful transmission
