pseudo-random unitary operators quantum information processing 
close analogy fundamental role random numbers classical information theory random operators basic component quantum information theory unfortunately implementation random unitary operators quantum processor exponentially hard introduce method generating pseudo-random unitary operators can reproduce statistical properties random unitary operators relevant quantum information tasks method requires exponentially fewer resources hence enables practical application random unitary operators quantum communication information processing protocols using nuclear magnetic resonance quantum processor able realize pseudo-random unitary operators reproduce expected random distribution matrix elements
