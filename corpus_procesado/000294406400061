entrainment population synthetic genetic oscillators
biological clocks self-sustained oscillators adjust phase daily environmental cycles process known entrainment molecular dissection mathematical modeling biological oscillators progressed quite far quantitative insights entrainment clocks relatively sparse simultaneously tracked phases hundreds synthetic genetic oscillators relative common external stimulus map entrainment regions predicted detailed model clock synthetic oscillators frequency-locked wide intervals external period showed higher-order resonance computational simulations indicated natural oscillators may contain positive-feedback loop robustly adapt environmental cycles
