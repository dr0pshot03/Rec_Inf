causes effects n-terminal codon bias bacterial genes
amino acids encoded multiple codons codon choice strong effects protein expression rare codons enriched n terminus genes organisms although causes effects bias unclear measure expression > synthetic reporters escherichia coli show using n-terminal rare codons instead common ones increases expression similar fold median fold quantify individual n-terminal codons affect expression show effects shape sequence natural genes finally demonstrate reduced rna structure codon rarity responsible expression increases observations resolve controversies roles n-terminal codon bias suggest straightforward method optimizing heterologous gene expression bacteria
