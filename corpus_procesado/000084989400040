three-dimensional direct imaging structural relaxation near colloidal glass transition
confocal microscopy used directly observe three-dimensional dynamics particles colloidal supercooled fluids colloidal glasses fastest particles moved cooperatively connected clusters mobile particles identified: cluster size distribution structure dynamics investigated characteristic cluster size grew markedly supercooled fluid glass transition approached agreement computer simulations glass transition however sudden drop size clusters fast-moving particles largest near alpha-relaxation time scale supercooled colloidal fluids also present albeit markedly different nature shorter beta-relaxation time scales supercooled fluid glass colloidal phases
