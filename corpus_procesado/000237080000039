wave defect dynamics nonlinear photonic quasicrystals
quasicrystals unique structures long-range order periodicity properties intrigued scientists ever since discovery initial theoretical analysis lack periodicity excludes possibility describing quasicrystal structures well-established analytical tools including common notions like brillouin zones blochs theorem new unique features fractal-like band structures- phason degrees freedom introduced general difficult directly observe evolution electronic waves solid-state atomic quasicrystals dynamics structure use optical induction- create two-dimensional photonic quasicrystals whose macroscopic nature allows us explore wave transport phenomena demonstrate light launched different quasicrystal sites travels lattice way equivalent quantum tunnelling electrons quasiperiodic potential high intensity lattice solitons formed finally directly observe dislocation dynamics crystal sites allowed interact experimental results apply photonics also quasiperiodic systems matter waves quasiperiodic traps generic pattern-forming systems parametrically excited surface waves liquid quasicrystals familiar atomic quasicrystals
