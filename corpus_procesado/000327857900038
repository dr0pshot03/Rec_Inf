mechanism reorientation cortical microtubule arrays driven microtubule severing
environmental hormonal signals cause reorganization microtubule arrays higher plants mechanisms driving transitions remained elusive organization arrays required direct morphogenesis discovered microtubule severing protein katanin plays crucial unexpected role reorientation cortical arrays triggered blue light imaging genetic experiments revealed phototropin photoreceptors stimulate katanin-mediated severing specifically microtubule intersections leading generation new microtubules locations show activity serves basis mechanism amplifies microtubules orthogonal initial array thereby driving array reorientation observations show severing used constructively build new microtubule array
