enantiospecific electrodeposition chiral catalyst
many biomolecules chiral-they can exist one two enantiomeric forms differ structures mirror images one enantiomer tends physiologically active inactive even toxic drug compounds increasingly produced enantiomerically pure form using solution-phase homogeneous catalysts enzymes chiral surfaces offer possibility developing heterogeneous enantioselective catalysts can readily separated products reused addition surfaces might serve electrochemical sensors chiral molecules date chiral surfaces obtained adsorbing chiral molecules- slicing single crystals exhibit high-index faces- surfaces act enantioselective heterogeneous catalysts show chiral surfaces can also produced electrodeposition relatively simple solution-based process resembles bio-mineralization- organic molecules adsorbed surfaces profound effects morphology inorganic deposits- electrodepositing copper oxide film achiral gold surface presence tartrate ion deposition solution chirality ion determines chirality deposited film turn determines films enantiospecificity subsequent electrochemical oxidation reactions
