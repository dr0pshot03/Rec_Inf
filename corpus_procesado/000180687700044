paucity genes drosophila x chromosome showing male-biased expression 
sex chromosomes primary determinants sexual dimorphism many organisms chromosomes thought arise via divergence ancestral autosome pair almost certainly influenced differing selection mates females exploring sex chromosomes differ autosomes highly amenable genomic analysis examined global gene expression drosophila melanogaster report dramatic underrepresentation x-chromosome genes showing high relative expression mates using comparative genomics find x-chromosome genes exceptionally poorly conserved mosquito anopheles gambiae data indicate x chromosome disfavored location genes selectively expressed males
