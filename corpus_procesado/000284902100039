video-rate molecular imaging vivo stimulated raman scattering 
optical imaging vivo molecular specificity important biomedicine high spatial resolution sensitivity compared magnetic resonance imaging stimulated raman scattering srs microscopy allows highly sensitive optical imaging based vibrational spectroscopy without adding toxic perturbative labels however srs imaging living animals humans feasible light collected thick tissues motion-blur arises slow imaging based backscattered light work enable vivo srs imaging substantially enhancing collection backscattered signal increasing imaging speed three orders magnitude video rate approach allows label-free vivo imaging water lipid protein skin mapping penetration pathways topically applied drugs mice humans
