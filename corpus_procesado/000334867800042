single-cell genomics reveals hundreds coexisting subpopulations wild prochlorococcus
extensive genomic diversity within coexisting members microbial species revealed selected cultured isolates metagenomic assemblies yet cell-by-cell genomic composition wild uncultured populations co-occurring cells largely unknown work applied large-scale single-cell genomics study populations globally abundant marine cyanobacterium prochlorococcus show composed hundreds subpopulations distinct genomic backbones backbone consisting different set core gene alleles linked small distinctive set flexible genes subpopulations estimated diverged least million years ago suggesting ancient stable niche partitioning large set coexisting subpopulations may general feature free-living bacterial species huge populations highly mixed habitats
