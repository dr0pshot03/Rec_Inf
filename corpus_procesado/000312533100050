optomechanical dark mode 
thermal mechanical motion hinders use mechanical system applications quantum information processing whereas thermal motion can overcome cooling mechanical oscillator motional ground state alternative approach exploit use mechanically dark mode can protect system mechanical dissipation realized dark mode coupling two optical modes silica resonator one mechanical breathing modes regime weak optomechanical coupling dark mode superposition two optical modes decoupled mechanical oscillator can still mediate effective optomechanical coupling two optical modes show formation dark mode enables transfer optical fields two optical modes optomechanical dark mode opens possibility using mechanically mediated coupling quantum applications without cooling mechanical oscillator motional ground state
