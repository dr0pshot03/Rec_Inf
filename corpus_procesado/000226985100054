lymphotoxin-mediated regulation gamma delta cell differentiation alpha beta t cell progenitors 
thymus gives rise two t cell lineages alphabeta gammadelta thought develop independently one another hence double positive dp thymocytes expressing cd4 cd8 coreceptors usually viewed simply progenitors cd4+ cd8+ alphabeta t cells instead report dip cells regulate differentiation early thymocyte progenitors gammadelta cells mechanism dependent transcription factor rorgammat lymphotoxin lt beta receptor ltbetar finding provokes revised view thymus lymphoid-tissue induction-type processes coordinate developmental functional integration two t cell lineages
