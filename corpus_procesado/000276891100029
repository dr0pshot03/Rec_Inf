lateral competition cortical space layer-specific horizontal circuits
cerebral cortex constructs coherent representation world integrating distinct features sensory environment although features processed vertically across cortical layers horizontal projections interconnecting neighbouring cortical domains allow features processed context-dependent manner despite wealth physiological psychophysical studies addressing function horizontal projections coordinate activity among cortical domains remains poorly understood addressed question selectively activating horizontal projection neurons mouse somatosensory cortex determined resulting spatial pattern excitation inhibition affects cortical activity found horizontal projections suppress superficial layers simultaneously activating deeper cortical output layers layer-specific modulation result spatial separation excitation inhibition layer-specific ratio two opposing conductances mechanism cortical domains exploit horizontal projections compete cortical space
