comparative analysis evolution imperfect mimicry 
although exceptional examples adaptation frequently celebrated outcomes natural selection seem far perfect example many hoverflies diptera: syrphidae harmless batesian mimics stinging hymenoptera however although hoverfly species considered excellent mimics species bear superficial resemblance models unclear evaluate hypotheses put forward explain interspecific variation mimetic fidelity palearctic syrphidae use comparative approach show plausible explanation predators impose less selection mimetic fidelity smaller hoverfly species less profitable prey items particular findings combination previous results allow us reject several key hypotheses imperfect mimicry: first human ratings mimetic fidelity positively correlated morphometric measures avian rankings indicating variation mimetic fidelity simply illusion based human perception second species syrphid maps multidimensional space intermediate appearance several different hymenopteran model species multimodel hypothesis requires third find evidence negative relationship mimetic fidelity abundance calls question kin-selection hypothesis contrast strong positive relationship mimetic fidelity body size supports relaxed-selection hypothesis suggesting reduced predation pressure less profitable prey species limits selection mimetic perfection
