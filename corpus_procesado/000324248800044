molecular trigger high-speed wing beats bee 
high-frequency wing beat higher-order insects driven self-sustained oscillations constantly activated flight muscles however whether underlying mechanism based flight muscle-specific features preexisting contractile functions unknown recorded x-ray diffraction movies rate frames/second simultaneously two antagonistic flight muscles bumblebees wing beat signals occurred right timing triggering wing-beat stroke resolved muscles signals likely reflect stretch-induced myosin deformation also enhance force vertebrate muscles results suggest insects use refined preexisting force-enhancing mechanism high-frequency wing beat rather developing novel mechanism
