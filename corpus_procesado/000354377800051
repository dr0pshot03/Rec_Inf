neural dynamics landmark orientation angular path integration 
many animals navigate using combination visual landmarks path integration mammalian brains head direction cells integrate two streams information representing animals heading relative landmarks yet maintaining directional tuning darkness based self-motion cues use two-photon calcium imaging head-fixed drosophila melanogaster walking ball virtual reality arena demonstrate landmark-based orientation angular path integration combined population responses neurons whose dendrites tile ellipsoid body toroidal structure centre fly brain neural population encodes flys azimuth relative environment tracking visual landmarks available relying self-motion cues darkness visual self-motion cues absent representation animals orientation maintained network persistent activity potential substrate short-term memory several features population dynamics neurons circular anatomical arrangement suggestive ring attractors network structures proposed support function navigational brain circuits
