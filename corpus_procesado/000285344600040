crtc3 links catecholamine signalling energy balance 
adipose-derived hormone leptin maintains energy balance part central nervous system-mediated increases sympathetic outflow enhance fat burning triggering beta-adrenergic receptors adipocytes stimulates energy expenditure cyclic amp camp-dependent increases lipolysis fatty-acid oxidation although mechanism unclear catecholamine signalling thought disrupted obesity leading development insulin resistance show camp response element binding creb coactivator crtc3 promotes obesity attenuating beta-adrenergic receptor signalling adipose tissue crtc3 activated response catecholamine signals reduced adenyl cyclase activity upregulating expression rgs2 gtpase-activating protein also inhibits adenyl cyclase activity common human crtc3 variant increased transcriptional activity associated adiposity two distinct mexican-american cohorts results suggest adipocyte crtc3 may play role development obesity humans
