genome sequence drosophila melanogaster
fly drosophila melanogaster one intensively studied organisms biology serves model system investigation many developmental cellular processes common higher eukaryotes including humans determined nucleotide sequence nearly similar megabase euchromatic portion drosophila genome using whole-genome shotgun sequencing strategy supported extensive clone-based sequence high-quality bacterial artificial chromosome physical map efforts way close remaining gaps however sequence sufficient accuracy contiguity declared substantially complete support initial analysis genome structure preliminary gene annotation interpretation genome encodes similar genes somewhat fewer smaller caenorhabditis elegans genome comparable functional diversity
