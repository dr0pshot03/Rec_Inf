voice-selective areas human auditory cortex 
human voice contains acoustic structure wealth information speakers identity emotional state perceive remarkable ease accuracy- although perception speaker-related features voice plays major role human communication little known neural basis- here:we show using functional magnetic resonance imaging human volunteers voice-selective regions can found bilaterally along upper bank superior temporal sulcus sts regions showed greater neuronal activity subjects listened passively vocal sounds whether speech non-speech non-vocal environmental sounds central sts regions also displayed high degree selectivity responding significantly vocal sounds matched control stimuli including scrambled voices amplitude-modulated noise moreover response stimuli degraded frequency filtering paralleled subjects behavioural performance voice-perception tasks used stimuli voice-selective areas sts may represent counterpart face-selective areas human visual cortex existence sheds new light functional architecture human auditory cortex
