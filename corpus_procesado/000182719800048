calculated phonon spectra plutonium high temperatures 
constructed computer-based simulations lattice dynamical properties plutonium using electronic structure method incorporates correlation effects among f-shell electrons calculates phonon spectra arbitrary wavelengths predicted spectrum face-centered cubic delta phase agrees well experiments elastic limit explains unusually large shear anisotropy material spectrum body-centered cubic phase shows instability zero temperature broad region wave vectors indicating phase highly anharmonic can stabilized high temperatures phonon entropy
