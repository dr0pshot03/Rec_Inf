removal phospho-head groups membrane lipids immobilizes voltage sensors k+ channels 
fundamental question gating mechanism voltage-activated k+ kv channels five positively charged voltage-sensing residues12 fourth transmembrane segment energetically stabilized operate low dielectric cell membrane simplest solution pair negative charges3 however negatively charged channel residues positioned role45 recent studies suggest channels positively charged residues exposed cell membrane phospholipids interact head groups5- key question nevertheless remains: phosphohead membrane lipids necessary proper function voltage sensor show given type kv channel may interact several species phospholipid enzymatic removal phospho-head creates insuperable energy barrier positively charged voltage sensor move initial gating step s thus immobilizing also raises energy barrier downstream step s
