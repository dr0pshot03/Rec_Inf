mobilization transposons mutation abolishing full dna methylation arabidopsis 
major component large genomes higher plants vertebrates comprises transposable elements derivatives potentially reduce stability genome proposed methylation cytosine residues may suppress transposition experimental evidence limited- reduced methylation repeat sequences results mutations arabidopsis gene ddm1 decrease dna methylation encodes protein similar chromatin-remodelling factor swi2/snf2 ref ddm1-induced hypomethylation background silent repeat sequences often reactivated transcriptionally transposition endogenous elements observed- striking feature ddm1 mutation induces developmental abnormalities causing heritable changes loci report one ddm1-induced abnormalities caused insertion cac1 endogenous cacta family transposon class arabidopsis elements transposes increases copy number high frequencies specifically ddm1 hypomethylation background thus ddm1 gene epigenetically ensures proper gene expression- also stabilizes transposon behaviour possibly chromatin remodelling dna methylation
