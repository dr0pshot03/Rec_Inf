equatorial oscillation saturns middle atmosphere
middle atmospheres planets driven combination radiative heating cooling mean meridional motions vertically propagating waves originate deep troposphere difficult model effects therefore observations essential advancing understanding atmospheres equatorial stratospheres earth jupiter oscillate quasi periodically timescales two four years respectively driven wave induced momentum transport- venus titan waves originating surface atmosphere interaction inertial instability thought drive atmosphere rotate rapidly surface superrotation however relevant wave modes yet precisely identified report infrared observations showing saturn equatorial oscillation like found earth jupiter well mid latitude subsidence may associated equatorial motion latitudinal extent saturns oscillation shows obeys basic physics earth jupiter future highly resolved observations temperature profile together modelling three different atmospheres will allow us determine wave mode wavelength wave amplitude lead middle atmosphere oscillation
