low dose oral cannabinoid therapy reduces progression atherosclerosis mice 
atherosclerosis chronic inflammatory disease primary cause heart disease stroke western countries derivatives cannabinoids delta--tetrahydrocannabinol thc modulate immune functions therefore potential treatment inflammatory diseases investigated effects thc murine model established atherosclerosis oral administration thc mg kg- per day resulted significant inhibition disease progression effective dose lower dose usually associated psychotropic effects thc furthermore detected cb2 receptor main cannabinoid receptor expressed immune cells human mouse atherosclerotic plaques lymphoid cells isolated thc-treated mice showed diminished proliferation capacity decreased interferon-gamma secretion macrophage chemotaxis crucial step development atherosclerosis also inhibited vitro thc effects completely blocked specific cb2 receptor antagonist data demonstrate oral treatment low dose thc inhibits atherosclerosis progression apolipoprotein e knockout mouse model pleiotropic immunomodulatory effects lymphoid myeloid cells thus thc cannabinoids activity cb2 receptor may valuable targets treating atherosclerosis
