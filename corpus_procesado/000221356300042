enhanced synaptic plasticity newly generated granule cells adult hippocampus
neural stem cells various regions vertebrate brain continuously generate neurons throughout life- mammalian hippocampus region important spatial episodic memory thousands new granule cells produced per day exact number depending environmental conditions physical exercise survival neurons improved learning conversely learning may promoted neurogenesis- although suggested newly generated neurons may specific properties facilitate learning cellular synaptic mechanisms plasticity neurons largely unknown show young granule cells adult hippocampus differ substantially mature granule cells active passive membrane properties young neurons t-type ca2+ channels can generate isolated ca2+ spikes boost fast na+ action potentials contributing induction synaptic plasticity associative long-term potentiation can induced easily young neurons mature neurons identical conditions thus newly generated neurons express unique mechanisms facilitate synaptic plasticity may important formation new memories
