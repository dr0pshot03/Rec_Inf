pol kappa: dna polymerase required sister chromatid cohesion
establishment cohesion sister chromatids coupled replication fork passage unknown mechanism report trf4 evolutionarily conserved gene necessary chromosome segregation encodes dna polymerase beta-polymerase-like properties double mutant redundant homologs trf4 trf5 unable complete s phase whereas trf4 single mutant completes presumably defective s phase results failure cohesion replicated sister chromatids suggests trfs key link coordination dna replication sister chromatid cohesion trf4 trf5 represent fourth class essential nuclear dna polymerases designated dna polymerase kappa saccharomyces cerevisiae probably eukaryotes
