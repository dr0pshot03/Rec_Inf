global distribution pure anorthosite moon 
thought lunar highland crust formed crystallization floatation plagioclase global magma ocean although actual generation mechanisms still debated composition lunar highland crust therefore important understanding formation magma ocean subsequent evolution moon multiband imager selenological engineering explorer selene high spatial resolution optimized spectral coverage allow clear view composition lunar crust report global distribution rocks high plagioclase abundance approaching vol% using unambiguous plagioclase absorption band recorded selene multiband imager upper crust indeed consists nearly vol% plagioclase significantly higher previous estimates vol% refs providing valuable constraint models lunar magma ocean evolution
