reverse engineering genotype-phenotype map natural genetic variation 
genetic variation occurs naturally population powerful resource studying genotype affects phenotype allele perturbation biological system genetic crosses processes recombination segregation randomize distribution alleles among progeny cross randomized genetic perturbations affect traits directly indirectly similarities differences traits responses common perturbations allow inferences whether variation trait cause phenotype disease whether trait variation instead effect phenotype possible use information causes effects build models probabilistic causal networks networks beginning define outlines genotype phenotype map
