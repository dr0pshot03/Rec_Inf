stem cell self-renewal controlled chromatin remodeling factors 
self-renewing ability stem cell controlled specialized microenvironment niche whereas epigenetic regulation gene expression chromatin remodeling factors underlies cell fate determination report adenosine triphosphate-dependent chromatin remodeling factors iswi dom control germline stem cell somatic stem cell self-renewal drosophila ovary respectively iswi mutant germline stem cells lost rapidly defects responding bone morphogenetic protein niche signals repressing differentiation whereas dom mutant somatic stem cells lost defective self-renewal work demonstrates different stem cell types can use different chromatin remodeling factors control cell self-renewal
