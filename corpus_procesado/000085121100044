efficient organic photovoltaic diodes based doped pentacene retracted article see vol pg
recent work solar cells based interpenetrating polymer networks- solid-state dye-sensitized devices shows efficient solar-energy conversion possible using organic materials demonstrated performance photovoltaic devices based small molecules can effectively enhanced doping organic material electron-accepting molecules inorganic solar cells show much higher efficiencies well per cent practical utility organic-based cells will require fabrication lower-rest techniques ideally flexible substrates demonstrate efficiency enhancement molecular doping schottky-type photovoltaic diodes based pentacene-an organic semiconductor received much attention promising material organic thin-film transistors- relatively little attention use photovoltaic devices incorporation dopant improves internal quantum efficiency five orders magnitude yields external energy conversion efficiency high per cent standard solar spectrum thin-film devices based doped pentacene therefore appear promising production efficient plastic solar cells
