band gap fluorescence individual single-walled carbon nanotubes 
fluorescence observed directly across band gap semiconducting carbon nanotubes obtained individual nanotubes encased cylindrical micelle ultrasonically agitating aqueous dispersion raw single-walled carbon nanotubes sodium dodecyl sulfate centrifuging remove tube bundles ropes residual catalyst aggregation nanotubes bundles otherwise quenches fluorescence interactions metallic tubes substantially broadens absorption spectra ph less absorption emission spectra individual nanotubes show evidence band gap selective protonation side walls tube protonation readily reversed treatment base ultraviolet light
