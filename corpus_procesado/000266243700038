origin electrostatic perturbation acetoacetate decarboxylase 
acetoacetate decarboxylase aadase long cited prototypical example marked shifts pka values ionizable groups can occur enzyme active site hypothesized aadase origin large pka perturbation - log units observed nucleophilic lys results proximity lys marking first proposal microenvironment effects enzymology electrostatic perturbation hypothesis demonstrated number enzymes never enzyme inspired conception owing lack three-dimensional structure present x-ray crystal structures aadase enamine adduct substrate analogue -pentanedione surprisingly shift pka lys due proximity lys side chain oriented away active site instead lys participates structural anchoring lys long hydrophobic funnel provided novel fold enzyme thus aadase perturbs pka nucleophile means desolvation effect placement side chain protein core enforcing proximity polar residues facilitate decarboxylation electrostatic steric effects
