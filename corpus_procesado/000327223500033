beyond stem cells: self-renewal differentiated macrophages 
many mammalian tissues mature differentiated cells replaced self-renewing stem cells either continuously homeostasis response challenge injury example hematopoietic stem cells generate mature blood cells including monocytes long thought major source tissue macrophages recently however major macrophage populations found derived embryonic progenitors renew independently hematopoietic stem cells process may require progenitors mature macrophages can proliferate response specific stimuli indefinitely without transformation loss functional differentiation findings suggest macrophages mature differentiated cells may self-renewal potential similar stem cells
