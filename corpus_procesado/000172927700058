control stem cell self-renewal drosophila spermatogenesis jak-stat signaling
stem cells regenerate tissue producing differentiating cells also produce cells renew stem cell population signals regulatory microenvironments niches thought cause stem cells retain self-renewing potential however molecular characterization niches remains important goat drosophila testes germ tine somatic stem cells attach cluster support cells called hub hub specifically expresses unpaired ligand activating jak-stat janus kinase-signal transducer activator transcription signaling cascade without jak-stat signaling germ line stem cells differentiate self-renew conversely ectopic jak-stat signaling greatly expands stem cell populations conclude support cells hub signal adjacent stem cells activation jak-stat pathway thereby defining niche stem cell self-renewal
