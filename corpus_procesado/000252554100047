coordinated regulation arabidopsis thaliana development light gibberellins 
light gibberellins gas mediate many essential partially overlapping plant developmental processes della proteins ga signalling repressors block ga induced development ga induces degradation della proteins via ubiquitin/ proteasome pathway light promotes accumulation della proteins reducing ga levels proposed della proteins restrain plant growth largely effect gene expression however precise mechanism function coordinating ga signalling gene expression remains unknown characterize nuclear protein interaction cascade mediating transduction ga signals activity regulation light responsive transcription factor absence ga nuclear localized della proteins accumulate higher levels interact phytochrome interacting factor pif3 bhlh type transcription factor prevent pif3 binding target gene promoters regulating gene expression therefore abrogate pif3 mediated light control hypocotyl elongation presence ga gid1 proteins ga receptors elevate direct interaction della proteins nucleus trigger della proteins ubiquitination proteasome mediated degradation thus release pif3 negative effect della proteins
