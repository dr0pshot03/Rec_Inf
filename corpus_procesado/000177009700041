short interfering rna confers intracellular antiviral immunity human cells 
gene silencing mediated double-stranded rna dsrna sequence-specific highly conserved mechanism eukaryotes plants serves antiviral defence mechanism- animal cells also possess machinery specific function unclear- demonstrate dsrna can effectively protect human cells infection rapidly replicating highly cytolytic rna virus pre-treatment human mouse cells double-stranded short interfering rnas sirnas poliovirus genome markedly reduces titre virus progeny promotes clearance virus infected cells antiviral effect sequence-specific attributable either classical antisense mechanisms interferon interferon response effectors protein kinase r pkr rnasel protection result direct targeting viral genome sirna sequence analysis escape virus resistant sirnas reveals one nucleotide substitution middle targeted sequence thus sirnas elicit specific intracellular antiviral resistance may provide therapeutic strategy human viruses
