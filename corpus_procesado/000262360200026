energy flux determines magnetic field strength planets stars 
themagnetic fields earth jupiter along rapidly rotating low mass stars generated convection driven dynamos may operate similarly- slowly rotating sun generates field different dynamo mechanism field strengths planets stars vary three orders magnitude critical factor causing variation hitherto unclear report extension scaling law derived geodynamo models rapidly rotating stars strong density stratification unifying principle scaling law energy flux available generating magnetic field sets field strength scaling law fits observed field strengths earth jupiter young contracting stars rapidly rotating low-mass stars despite vast differences physical conditions objects predict field strengths rapidly rotating brown dwarfs massive extrasolar planets high enough make observable
