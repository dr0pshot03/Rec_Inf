compartmentalized binary behavior terminal dendrites hippocampal pyramidal neurons
dendritic arbor pyramidal neurons monolithic structure show excitability terminal apical dendrites differs apical trunk response fluorescence-guided focal photolysis caged glutamate individual terminal apical dendrites generated cadmium-sensitive all-or-none responses subthreshold somatic action potentials calcium transients produced all-or-none responses restricted sites photolysis occurred throughout individual distal dendritic compartments indicating electrogenesis mediated primarily voltage-gated calcium channels compartmentalized binary behavior parallel-connected terminal dendrites can greatly expand computational power single neuron
