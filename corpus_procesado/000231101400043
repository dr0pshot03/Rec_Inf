pyrite-type high-pressure form silica 
silica sio2 exhibits extensive polymorphism elevated pressures x-ray diffraction measurements showed high-pressure form pyrite-type structure denser known silica phases stable gigapascals kelvin silicon coordination number increases alpha-pbo2-type phase + pyrite-type phase leading large increase density % phase transition
