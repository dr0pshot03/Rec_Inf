fan1 acts fanci-fancd2 promote dna interstrand cross-link repair
fanconi anemia fa caused mutations fanc genes renders cells hypersensitive dna interstrand cross-linking icl agents central event fa pathway mono-ubiquitylation fanci-fancd2 id protein complex characterize previously unrecognized nuclease fanconi anemia-associated nuclease fan1 promotes icl repair manner strictly dependent ability accumulate near sites dna damage relies mono-ubiquitylation id complex thus mono-ubiquitylated id complex recruits downstream repair protein fan1 facilitates repair dna interstrand cross-links
