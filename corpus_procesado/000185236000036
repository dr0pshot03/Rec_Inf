efficient bulk heterojunction photovoltaic cells using small-molecular-weight organic thin films 
power conversion efficiency small-molecular-weight polymer organic photovoltaic cells increased steadily past decade progress chiefly attributable introduction donor-acceptor heterojunction functions dissociation site strongly bound photogenerated excitons progress realized polymer devices use blends donor acceptor materials- : phase separation spin-coating leads bulk heterojunction removes exciton diffusion bottleneck creating interpenetrating network donor acceptor materials realization bulk heterojunctions using mixtures vacuum-deposited small-molecular-weight materials hand posed elusive: phase separation induced elevating substrate temperature inevitably leads significant roughening film surface short-circuited devices demonstrate use metal cap confine organic materials annealing prevents formation rough surface morphology allowing formation interpenetrating donor-acceptor network method results power conversion efficiency per cent higher best values reported comparable bilayer devices suggesting strained annealing process allow formation low-cost high-efficiency thin film organic solar cells based vacuum-deposited small-molecular-weight organic materials
