simple complex verge breakdown: isolation elusive cyanoformate ion
cyanide react destructively proximal iron center active site aminocyclopropane--carboxylic acid acc oxidase enzyme central biosynthesis ethylene plants long postulated cyanoformate anion [ncco2]- forms decomposes carbon dioxide cyanide process now isolated crystallographically characterized elusive anion tetraphenylphosphonium salt theoretical calculations show cyanoformate weak c-c bond thermodynamically stable low dielectric media solution stability studies substantiated latter result propose cyanoformate shuttles potentially toxic cyanide away low dielectric active site acc oxidase breaking higher dielectric medium cell
