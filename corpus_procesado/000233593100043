creation six-atom schrodinger cat state
among classes highly entangled states multiple quantum systems called schrodinger cat states particularly useful cat states equal superpositions two maximally different quantum states fundamental resource fault tolerant quantum computing- quantum communication can enable protocols open destination teleportation secret sharing play role fundamental tests quantum mechanics enable improved signal noise ratios interferometry cat states sensitive decoherence result preparation challenging can serve demonstration good quantum control report creation cat states six atomic qubits qubits state space defined two hyperfine ground states beryllium ion cat state corresponds entangled equal superposition atoms one hyperfine state atoms hyperfine state experiments cat states prepared three step process irrespective number entangled atoms together entangled states different class created innsbruck work represents current state art large entangled states qubit system
