bacterial recognition mineral surfaces: nanoscale interactions shewanella alpha-feooh 
force microscopy used quantitatively measure infinitesimal forces characterize interactions shewanella oneidensis dissimilatory metal-reducing bacterium goethite alpha feooh commonly found earth near-surface environments force measurements subnano-newton resolution made real time living cells aerobic anaerobic solutions function distance nanometers cell mineral surface energy values [in attojoules - joules] derived measurements show affinity s oneidensis goethite rapidly increases two five times anaerobic conditions electron transfer bacterium mineral expected specific signatures force curves suggest kilodalton putative iron reductase mobilized within outer membrane s oneidensis specifically interacts goethite surface facilitate electron transfer process
