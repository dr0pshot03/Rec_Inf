two-particle quantum interference tunnel-coupled optical tweezers
quantum statistics atoms typically observed behavior ensemble via macroscopic observables however quantum statistics modifies behavior even two particles demonstrate near-complete control internal external degrees freedom two laser-cooled rb atoms trapped two optical tweezers controllability allows us observe signatures indistinguishability via two-particle interference work establishes laser-cooled atoms optical tweezers promising route bottom-up engineering scalable low-entropy quantum systems
