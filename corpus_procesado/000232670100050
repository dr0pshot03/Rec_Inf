akt-mediated phsophorylationof ezh2 suppresses methylation lysine histone h3
enhancer zeste homolog ezh2 methyltransferase plays important role many biological processes ability trimethylate lysine histone h3 show akt phosphorylates ezh2 serine suppresses methyltransferase activity impeding ezh2 binding histone h3 results decrease lysine trimethylation derepression silenced genes results imply akt regulates methylation activity phosphorylation ezh2 may contribute oncogenesis
