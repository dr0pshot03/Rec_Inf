quantifying uncertainties climate system properties use recent climate observations
derive joint probability density distributions three key uncertain properties climate system using optimal fingerprinting approach compare simulations intermediate complexity climate model three distinct diagnostics recent climate observations basis marginal probability distributions % confidence intervals kelvin climate sensitivity watt per square meter net aerosol forcing oceanic heat uptake well constrained ocean temperature observations help constrain climate sensitivity uncertainty net aerosol forcing much smaller uncertainty range indirect aerosol forcing alone given intergovernmental panel climate change third assessment report
