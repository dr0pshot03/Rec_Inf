eukaryotic organisms inappropriate firing replication origins g phase cell cycle suppressed cyclin-dependent kinases multicellular eukaryotes contain second putative inhibitor re-replication called geminin geminin believed block binding mini-chromosome maintenance mcm complex origins replication mechanism inhibition unclear show geminin interacts tightly cdt1 recently identified replication initiation factor necessary mcm loading inhibition dna replication geminin observed cell-free dna replication extracts reversed addition excess cdt1 normal cell cycle cdt1 present g s whereas geminin present s g phases cell cycle together results suggest geminin inhibits inappropriate origin firing targeting cdt1
