robust normal mode constraints inner-core anisotropy model space search 
technique searching full model space applied measurements anomalously split normal modes showed robust pattern p-wave s-wave anisotropy inner core parameter describing p-wave anisotropy changes sign around radius kilometers whereas s-wave anisotropy small upper two-thirds inner core becomes negative greater depths results agree observed travel-time anomalies rays traveling epicentral distances varying 150degrees 180degrees models may explained progressively tilted hexagonal close-packed iron upper half inner core suggest different iron phase center
