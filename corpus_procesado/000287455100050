time-reversed lasing interferometric control absorption
time-reversed counterpart laser emission incident coherent optical fields perfectly absorbed within resonator contains loss medium instead gain medium incident fields frequency must coincide corresponding laser gain demonstrated effect two counterpropagating incident fields silicon cavity showing absorption can enhanced two orders magnitude maximum predicted theory experimental setup addition showed absorption can reduced substantially varying relative phase incident fields device termed coherent perfect absorber functions absorptive interferometer potential practical applications integrated optics
