generation megawatt optical solitons hollow-core photonic band-gap fibers
measured dispersion low-loss hollow-core photonic band-gap fiber anomalous throughout transmission band variation wavelength large compared conventional step-index fiber air-filled fiber femtosecond self-frequency-shifted fundamental solitons peak powers greater megawatts can supported xe-filled fibers nonfrequency-shifted temporal solitons peak powers greater megawatts can generated representing increase power can propagated optical fiber two orders magnitude results demonstrate unique capability deliver high-power pulses single spatial mode distances exceeding meters
