contact inhibition locomotion vivo controls neural crest directional migration 
contact inhibition locomotion discovered abercrombie years ago describes behaviour fibroblast cells confronting vitro retract protrusions change direction contact failure suggested contribute malignant invasion- however molecular basis contact inhibition locomotion whether also occurs vivo still unknown show neural crest cells highly migratory multipotent embryonic cell population whose behaviour likened malignant invasion- demonstrate contact inhibition locomotion vivo vitro accounts directional migration two migrating neural crest cells meet stop collapse protrusions change direction contrast neural crest cell meets another cell type fails display contact inhibition locomotion instead invades tissue manner metastatic cancer cells show inhibition non-canonical wnt signalling abolishes contact inhibition locomotion directionality neural crest migration wnt signalling members localize site cell contact leading activation rhoa region results provide first example contact inhibition locomotion vivo provide explanation coherent directional migration groups cells establish previously unknown role noncanonical wnt signalling
