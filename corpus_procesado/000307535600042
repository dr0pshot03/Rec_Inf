circadian rhythm redox state regulates excitability suprachiasmatic nucleus neurons 
daily rhythms mammalian physiology metabolism behavior parallel day-night cycle orchestrated central circadian clock brain suprachiasmatic nucleus scn transcription clock genes sensitive metabolic changes reduction oxidation redox; however circadian cycles protein oxidation reported anucleate cells transcription occurs investigated whether scn also expresses redox cycles metabolic oscillations might affect neuronal physiology detected self-sustained circadian rhythms scn redox state required molecular clockwork redox oscillation determine excitability scn neurons nontranscriptional modulation multiple potassium k+ channels thus dynamic regulation scn excitability appears closely tied metabolism engages clockwork machinery
