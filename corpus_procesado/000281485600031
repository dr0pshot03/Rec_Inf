graphene visualizes first water adlayers mica ambient conditions
dynamic nature first water adlayers solid surfaces room temperature made direct detection microscopic structure challenging used graphene atomically flat coating atomic force microscopy determine structure water adlayers mica room temperature function relative humidity water adlayers grew epitaxially mica substrate layer-by-layer fashion submonolayers form atomically flat faceted islands height +/ nanometers agreement height monolayer ice second adlayers observed higher relative humidity also appear icelike thicker layers appear liquidlike results also indicate nanometer-scale surface defects serve nucleation centers formation first second adlayers
