parallel neural pathways mediate co2 avoidance responses drosophila
different stimulus intensities elicit distinct perceptions implying input signals either conveyed overlapping distinct subpopulation sensory neurons channeled divergent brain circuits according intensity drosophila carbon dioxide co2 detected single type olfactory sensory neuron information conveyed higher brain centers second-order projection neurons pns two distinct pathways pnv pnv- necessary sufficient avoidance responses low high co2 concentrations respectively whereas low concentrations activate pnv- high concentrations activate pnvs gabaergic pnv- may inhibit pnv pathway-mediated avoidance behavior channeling sensory input distinct neural pathways allows perception odor modulated stimulus intensity context
