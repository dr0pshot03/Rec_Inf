contributions anthropogenic natural forcing recent tropopause height changes
observations indicate height tropopause-the boundary stratosphere troposphere-has increased several hundred meters since comparable increases evident climate model experiments latter show human-induced changes ozone well-mixed greenhouse gases account similar to80% simulated rise tropopause height primary contributions cooling stratosphere caused ozone warming troposphere caused well-mixed greenhouse gases model-predicted fingerprint tropopause height changes statistically detectable two different observational reanalysis data sets positive detection result allows us attribute overall tropopause height changes combination anthropogenic natural external forcings anthropogenic component predominating
