natural examples olivine lattice preferred orientation patterns flow normal a-axis maximum
tectonic plate motion thought cause solid-state plastic flow within underlying upper mantle accordingly lead development lattice preferred orientation constituent olivine crystals- mechanical anisotropy results preferred orientation typically produces direction maximum seismic wave velocity parallel plate motion direction explained existence olivine preferred orientation a-axis maximum parallel induced mantle flow direction- subduction zones however olivine axes inferred arranged roughly perpendicular plate motion- usually ascribed localized complex mantle flow patterns- recent experimental work suggests alternative explanation: conditions high water activity b-type olivine preferred orientation may form a-axis maximum perpendicular flow direction natural examples b-type preferred orientation however almost entirely unknown document widespread b-type olivine preferred orientation patterns subduction-type metamorphic belt southwest japan show patterns developed presence water discovery implies mantle flow subduction zones may much simpler generally thought
