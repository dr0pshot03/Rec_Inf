three modes synaptic vesicular recycling revealed single-vesicle imaging
synapses recycle spent vesicles order keep on-going neurotransmitter release investigate vesicle recycling small synapses hippocampal neurons used optical recording method permits us resolve single-vesicle events show exocytic event can terminate three modes vesicle retrieval: fast ms kiss-and-run mode selective fusion pore slow s compensatory mode stranded mode recycling vesicle left cell surface nerve impulse triggers retrieval also observed response nerve impulse synapses low release probability primarily use kiss-and-run mode whereas high release probability terminals predominantly use compensatory mode vesicle retrieval
