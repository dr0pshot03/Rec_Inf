anaerobic benzene oxidation coupled nitrate reduction pure culture two strains dechloromonas 
benzene contamination significant problem used wide range manufacturing processes primary component petroleum-based fuels benzene hydrocarbon soluble mobile toxic stable especially ground surface waters poorly biodegraded absence oxygen however anaerobic benzene biodegradation documented various conditions although benzene biomineralization demonstrated nitrate feiii- sulphate co28 alternative electron acceptors studies based sediments microbial enrichments now organisms pure culture degraded benzene anaerobically report two dechloromonas strains rcb jj can completely mineralize various mono-aromatic compounds including benzene co2 absence o nitrate electron acceptor first example knowledge organism type can oxidize benzene anaerobically demonstrate potential applicability organisms treatment contaminated environments
