force production disassembling microtubules
microtubules mts important components eukaryotic cytoskeleton: contribute cell shape movement well motions organelles including mitotic chromosomes mts bind motor enzymes drive many movements mt dynamics can also contribute organelle motility- mt polymer store chemical energy can used mechanical work energy converted motility remains unknown show conjugating glass microbeads tubulin polymers strong inert linkages biotin-avidin depolymerizing mts exert brief tug beads measured laser tweezers analysis interactions molecular-mechanical model mt structure force production shows single depolymerizing mt can generate ten times force developed motor enzyme thus mechanism might primary driving force chromosome motion even simple coupler used slows mt disassembly physiological couplers may modulate mt dynamics vivo
