gridlock signalling pathway fashions first embryonic artery
arteries veins morphologically functionally molecularly different distinction established vasculogenesis unknown show lineage tracking zebrafish embryos angioblast precursors trunk artery vein spatially mixed lateral posterior mesoderm progeny angioblast however restricted one vessels arterial-venous decision guided gridlock grl artery-restricted gene expressed lateral posterior mesoderm graded reduction grl expression mutation morpholino antisense progressively ablates regions artery expands contiguous regions vein preceded increase expression venous marker ephb4 receptor ephb4 diminution expression arterial marker ephrin-b2 efnb2 grl downstream notch interference notch signalling blocking suh similarly reduces artery increases vein thus notch-grl pathway controls assembly first embryonic artery apparently adjudicating arterial versus venous cell fate decision
