black hole accretion 
black holes often detected radiation produced gravitationally pull surrounding gas process called accretion efficiency hot gas radiates thermal energy strongly influences geometry dynamics accretion flow radiatively efficient thin disks radiatively inefficient thick disks observed accreting gas gets close central black hole radiation produces becomes sensitive spin hole presence event horizon analysis luminosities spectra accreting black holes yielded tantalizing evidence rotating holes event horizons numerical simulations imply relativistic jets often seen accreting black holes may powered part spin hole
