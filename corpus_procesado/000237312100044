sand seas titan: cassini radar observations longitudinal dunes 
recent cassini radar images titan show widespread regions kilometers kilometers near-parallel radar-dark linear features appear seas longitudinal dunes similar seen namib desert earth ku-band -centimeter wavelength images show similar -meter ridges consistent duneforms reveal flow interactions underlying hills distribution orientation dunes support model fluctuating surface winds similar meter per second resulting combination eastward flow variable tidal wind existence dunes also requires geological processes create sand-sized -micrometer particulates lack persistent equatorial surface liquids act sand traps
