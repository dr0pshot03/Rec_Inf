evolution magnetic field structure crab pulsar
pulsars highly magnetized rotating neutron stars well known stability signature pulse shapes allowing high-precision studies rotation however past years radio pulse profile crab pulsar shown steady increase separation main pulse interpulse components degrees +/ degrees per century also secular changes relative strengths several components profile changing component separation indicates axis dipolar magnetic field embedded neutron star moving toward stellar equator evolution magnetic field explain pulsar spin expected simple braking rotating dipolar magnetic field
