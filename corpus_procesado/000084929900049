transgenic mouse model stunned myocardium
stunned myocardium syndrome reversible contractile failure frequently complicates coronary artery disease cardiac excitation uncoupled contraction level myofilaments selective proteolysis thin filament protein troponin correlated stunned myocardium transgenic mice expressing major degradation product troponin tni- heart found develop ventricular dilatation diminished contractility reduced myofilament calcium responsiveness recapitulating phenotype stunned myocardium proteolysis troponin also occurs ischemic human cardiac muscle thus troponin proteolysis underlies pathogenesis common acquired form heart failure
