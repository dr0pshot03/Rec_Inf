coactivation receptor tyrosine kinases affects response tumor cells targeted therapies 
targeted therapies inhibit receptor tyrosine kinases rtks downstream phosphatidylinositol -kinase pi3k signaling pathway shown promising anticancer activity efficacy brain tumor glioblastoma multiforme gbm solid tumors modest hypothesized multiple rtks coactivated tumors redundant inputs drive maintain downstream signaling thereby limiting efficacy therapies targeting single rtks tumor cell lines xenotransplants primary tumors indeed show multiple concomitantly activated rtks combinations rtk inhibitors and/or rna interference single agents decreased signaling cell survival anchorage-independent growth even glioma cells deficient pten frequently inactivated inhibitor pi3k thus effective gbm therapy may require combined regimens targeting multiple rtks
