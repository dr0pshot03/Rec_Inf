myc inactivation uncovers pluripotent differentiation tumour dormancy hepatocellular cancer
hepatocellular carcinoma generally refractory clinical treatment report inactivation myc oncogene sufficient induce sustained regression invasive liver cancers myc inactivation resulted en masse tumour cells differentiating hepatocytes biliary cells forming bile duct structures associated rapid loss expression tumour marker alpha-fetoprotein increase expression liver cell markers cytokeratin carcinoembryonic antigen cells liver stem cell marker cytokeratin using vivo bioluminescence imaging found many tumour cells remained dormant long myc remain inactivated however myc reactivation immediately restored neoplastic features using array comparative genomic hybridization confirmed dormant liver cells restored tumour retained identical molecular signature hence clonally derived tumour cells results show oncogene inactivation may reverse tumorigenesis clinically difficult cancers oncogene inactivation uncovers pluripotent capacity tumours differentiate normal cellular lineages tissue structures retaining latent potential become cancerous hence existing state tumour dormancy
