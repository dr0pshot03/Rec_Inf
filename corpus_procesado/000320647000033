liquid exfoliation layered materials 
crystals form atomic bonds three dimensions layered crystals instance form strong chemical bonds in-plane display weak out-of-plane bonding allows exfoliated so-called nanosheets can micrometers wide less nanometer thick exfoliation leads materials extraordinary values crystal surface area excess square meters per gram can result dramatically enhanced surface activity leading important applications electrodes supercapacitors batteries another result exfoliation quantum confinement electrons two dimensions transforming electron band structure yield new types electronic magnetic materials exfoliated materials also range applications composites molecularly thin barriers reinforcing conductive fillers review exfoliation-especially liquid phase-as transformative process material science yielding new exotic materials radically different bulk layered counterparts
