cda directs metabolism epigenetic nucleosides revealing therapeutic window cancer 
cells require nucleotides support dna replication repair damaged dna addition de novo synthesis cells recycle nucleotides dna dying cells cellular material ingested diet salvaged nucleosides come complication can contain epigenetic modifications epigenetic inheritance dna methylation mainly relies copying modification pattern parental strands- random incorporation pre-modified bases replication profound implications epigenome fidelity yield adverse cellular phenotypes although salvage mechanism methyl-deoxycytidine 5mdc investigated before- remains unknown cells deal recently identified oxidized forms 5mdc: hydroxymethyl-deoxycytidine 5hmdc formy-deoxycytidine 5fdc carboxyl-deoxycytidine 5cadc- show enzymes nucleotide salvage pathway display substrate selectivity effectively protecting newly synthesized dna incorporation epigenetically modified forms cytosine thus cell lines animals can tolerate high doses modified cytidines without deleterious effects physiology notably screening cancer cell lines growth defects exposure 5hmdc unexpectedly identify subset cell lines 5hmdc 5fdc administration leads cell lethality using genomic approaches show susceptible cell lines overexpress cytidine deaminase cda cda converts 5hmdc 5fdc variants uridine incorporated dna resulting accumulation dna damage ultimately cell death observations extend current knowledge nucleotide salvage pathway revealing metabolism oxidized epigenetic bases suggest new therapeutic option cancers pancreatic cancer cda overexpression resistant treatment cytidine analogues
