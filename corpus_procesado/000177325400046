map kinase phosphatase locus flexibility mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling network 
intracellular signaling networks receive process information control cellular machines mitogen-activated protein kinase mapk /protein kinase c pkc system one network regulates many cellular machines including cell cycle machinery autocrine/paracrine factor synthesizing machinery used combination computational analysis experiments mouse nih-3t3 fibroblasts understand design principles controller network find growth factor stimulated signaling network containing mapk /pkc can operate one monostable two bistable stable states low concentrations mapk phosphatase system exhibits bistable behavior brief stimulus results sustained mapk activation mapk-induced increase amounts mapk phosphatase eliminates prolonged response capability moves network monostable state behaves proportional response system responding acutely stimulus thus mapk /pkc controller network flexibly designed mapk phosphatase may critical flexible response
