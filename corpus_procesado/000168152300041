self-assembly mesoscopically ordered chromatic polydiacetylene/silica nanocomposites 
nature abounds intricate composite architectures composed hard soft materials synergistically intertwined provide useful functionality mechanical integrity recent synthetic efforts mimic natural designs focused nanocomposites- prepared mainly slow procedures like monomer polymer infiltration inorganic nanostructures sequential deposition report self-assembly conjugated polymer/silica nanocomposite films hexagonal cubic lamellar mesoscopic order using polymerizable amphiphilic diacetylene molecules structure-directing agents monomers self-assembly procedure rapid incorporates organic monomers uniformly within highly ordered inorganic environment polymerization results polydiacetylene/silica nanocomposites optically transparent mechanically robust compared ordered diacetylene-containing films prepared langmuir monolayers langmuir-blodgett deposition nanostructured inorganic host alters diacetylene polymerization behaviour resulting nanocomposite exhibits unusual chromatic changes response thermal mechanical chemical stimuli inorganic framework serves protect stabilize orient polymer mediate function nanocomposite architecture also provides sufficient mechanical integrity enable integration devices microsystems
