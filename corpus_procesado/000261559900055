dna double-strand breaks activate multi-functional genetic program developing lymphocytes 
dna double strand breaks generated genotoxic agents cellular endonucleases intermediates several important physiological processes cellular response genotoxic dna breaks includes activation transcriptional programs known primarily regulate cell cycle checkpoints cell survival- dna double strand breaks generated developing lymphocytes assembly antigen receptor genes process essential normal lymphocyte development show murine lymphocytes physiological dna breaks activate broad transcriptional program program transcends canonical dna double strand break response includes many genes regulate diverse cellular processes important lymphocyte development moreover expression several genes regulated similarly response genotoxic dna damage thus physiological dna double strand breaks provide cues can regulate cell type specific processes directly involved maintaining integrity genome genotoxic dna breaks disrupt normal cellular functions corrupting processes
