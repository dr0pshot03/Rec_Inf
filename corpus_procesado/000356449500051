structural basis nucleotide exchange heterotrimeric g proteins 
g protein-coupled receptors gpcrs relay diverse extracellular signals cells catalyzing nucleotide release heterotrimeric g proteins mechanism underlying quintessential molecular signaling event remained unclear use atomic-level simulations elucidate nucleotide-release mechanism find g protein subunit ras helical domains-previously observed separate widely upon receptor binding expose nucleotide-binding site-separate spontaneously frequently even absence receptor domain separation necessary sufficient rapid nucleotide release rather receptors catalyze nucleotide release favoring internal structural rearrangement ras domain weakens nucleotide affinity use double electron-electron resonance spectroscopy protein engineering confirm predictions computationally determined mechanism
