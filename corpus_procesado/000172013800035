neuroscience neurobiology slow synaptic transmission
nerve cells communicate two mechanisms referred fast slow synaptic transmission fast-acting neurotransmitters eg glutamate excitatory gamma aminobutyric add gaba inhibitory achieve effects target cells within one millisecond virtue opening ligand-operated ion channels contrast effects biogenic amine peptide neurotransmitters well many effects glutamate gaba achieved hundreds milliseconds minutes slow synaptic transmission latter process mediated enormously complicated sequence biochemical steps involving second messengers protein kinases protein phosphatases slow-acting neurotransmitters control efficacy fast synaptic transmission regulating efficiency neurotransmitter release presynaptic terminals regulating efficiency fast-acting neurotransmitters produce effects postsynaptic receptors
