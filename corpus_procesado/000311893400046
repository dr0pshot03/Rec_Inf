non-synaptic inhibition grouped neurons olfactory circuit 
diverse sensory organs including mammalian taste buds insect chemosensory sensilla show marked compartmentalization receptor cells however functional impact organization remains unclear show compartmentalized drosophila olfactory receptor neurons orns communicate directly sustained response one orn inhibited transient activation neighbouring orn mechanistically lateral inhibition depend synapses probably mediated ephaptic coupling moreover lateral inhibition periphery can modulate olfactory behaviour together results show integration olfactory information can occur via lateral interactions orns inhibition sustained response transient response may provide means encoding salience finally co2-sensitive orn malaria mosquito anopheles can also inhibited excitation adjacent orn suggesting broad occurrence lateral inhibition insects possible applications insect control
