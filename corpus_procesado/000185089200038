ecological genetic spatial structuring canadian lynx 
canadian lynx distributed across northern part north america well known regular population cycles-cycles different underlying structures different parts canada1 using nuclear mitochondrial dna markers report close resemblance earlier observed spatial ecological structuring canadian lynx1 spatial genetic structuring specifically demonstrate rocky mountains represent barrier gene flow western canada somewhat surprisingly detect presence geographically invisible barrier south hudson bay coinciding separation ecological continental atlantic regions1 evidence isolation different glacial refugia within north america found suggest ecological factors underlying spatial dynamic structuring also strongly influence genetic structuring canadian lynx
