developmental patterning relies morphogen gradients generally involve feedback loops buffer perturbations caused fluctuations gene dosage expression1 although many gene components involved feedback loops identified work together generate robust pattern remains unclear study network extracellular proteins patterns dorsal region drosophila embryo establishing graded activation bone morphogenic protein bmp pathway find bmp activation gradient robust changes gene dosage computational search networks support robustness shows transport bmp class ligands scw dpp dorsal midline bmp inhibitor sog key event patterning process mechanism underlying robustness relies ability store excess signalling molecules restricted spatial domain sog largely absent requires extensive diffusion bmp-sog complexes coupled restricted diffusion free ligands show experimentally dpp widely diffusible presence sog tightly localized absence thus validating central prediction theoretical study
