role g-protein-coupled adenosine receptors downregulation inflammation protection tissue damage
inappropriate prolonged inflammation main cause many diseases reason important understand physiological mechanisms terminate inflammation vivo agonists several gs-protein-coupled receptors including cell-surface adenosine purinergic receptors- can increase levels immunosuppressive cyclic amp immune cells- however unknown whether receptors regulates inflammation vivo show a2a adenosine receptors non-redundant role attenuation inflammation tissue damage vivo sub-threshold doses inflammatory stimulus caused minimal tissue damage wild-type mice sufficient induce extensive tissue damage prolonged higher levels pro-inflammatory cytokines death male animals deficient a2a adenosine receptor similar observations made studies three different models inflammation liver damage well bacterial endotoxin-induced septic shock suggest a2a adenosine receptors critical part physiological negative feedback mechanism limitation termination tissue-specific systemic inflammatory responses
