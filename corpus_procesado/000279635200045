explaining structure archean mass-independent sulfur isotope record
sulfur isotopes ancient sediments provide record past environmental conditions long-time-scale variability apparent asymmetry magnitude minor sulfur isotope fractionation archean sediments remain unexplained using integrated biogeochemical model archean sulfur cycle find preservation mass-independent sulfur influenced variety extra-atmospheric mechanisms including biological activity continental crust formation preservation atmospherically produced mass-independent sulfur implies limited metabolic sulfur cycling similar million years ago asymmetry record indicates bacterial sulfate reduction geochemically unimportant time results suggest large-scale structure record reflects variability oxidation state volcanic sulfur volatiles
