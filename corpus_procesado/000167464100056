transcription coactivator p300 binds pcna may role dna repair synthesis 
transcriptional coactivator p300 interacts many transcription factors participate broad spectrum biological activities cellular differentiation homeostasis growth control12 mouse embryos lacking p300 alleles die around mid-gestation pleiotropic defects morphogenesis cell differentiation unexpectedly cell proliferation reduced dna synthesis3 show p300 may role dna repair synthesis interaction proliferating cell nuclear antigen pcna show vitro vivo p300 forms complex pcna depend s phase cell cycle large fraction p300 pcna colocalize speckled structures nucleus furthermore endogenous p300-pcna complex stimulates dna synthesis vitro chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments indicate p300 associated freshly synthesized dna ultraviolet irradiation results suggest p300 may participate chromatin remodelling dna lesion sites facilitate pcna function dna repair synthesis
