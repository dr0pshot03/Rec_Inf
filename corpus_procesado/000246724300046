ubiquitin-binding protein rap80 mediates brca1-dependent dna damage response 
mutations breast cancer susceptibility gene brca1 associated increased risk breast ovarian cancers brca1 participates cellular dna damage response report identification receptor-associated protein rap80 brca1-interacting protein humans rap80 contains tandem ubiquitin-interacting motif domain required binding ubiquitin vitro damage-induced foci formation vivo moreover rap80 specifically recruits brca1 dna damage sites functions brca1 g/m checkpoint control together results suggest existence ubiquitination-dependent signaling pathway involved dna damage response
