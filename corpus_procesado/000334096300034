developmental switch axon targeting continuously regenerating mouse olfactory system 
mammalian olfactory system natural capacity regenerate throughout animals life span despite constant neurogenesis olfactory sensory neurons project precise stereotypical positions brain identify critical period olfactory sensory axon targeting postnatal development mouse perturbing axon projection beyond postnatal day permanently disrupts targeting specificity sensory neurons addition find establishment convergence map requires perinatal sensory neurons late-born neurons appear connect prospective glomeruli based homotypic interactions among neurons expressing odorant receptor results reveal developmental switch axon guidance mechanism circuit integration adult-born neurons
