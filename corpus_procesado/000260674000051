essential role copn protein chlamydia pneumoniae intracellular growth
bacterial virulence determinants can identified according molecular kochs postulates inactivation gene associated suspected virulence trait results loss pathogenicity approach commonly used genetically tractable organisms however current lack tools targeted gene disruptions obligate intracellular microbial pathogens seriously hampers identification virulence factors demonstrate approach studying potential virulence factors genetically intractable organisms chlamydia heterologous expression chlamydia pneumoniae copn yeast mammalian cells resulted cell cycle arrest presumably owing alterations microtubule cytoskeleton screen small molecule library identified two compounds alleviated copn-induced growth inhibition yeast compounds interfered c pneumoniae replication mammalian cells presumably knocking copn function revealing essential role copn support c pneumoniae growth infection work demonstrates role specific chlamydial protein virulence chemical biology approach described can used identify virulence factors reverse chemical genetic strategy can result identification lead compounds development novel therapeutics
