three-dimensional structural view central metabolic network thermotoga maritima
metabolic pathways traditionally described terms biochemical reactions metabolites use structural genomics systems biology generated three-dimensional reconstruction central metabolic network bacterium thermotoga maritima network encompassed proteins determined experiment modeled structural analysis revealed proteins forming network dominated small number basic shapes folds performing diverse mostly related functions folds already present essential core similar % network expansion nonessential proteins achieved relatively additional folds thus integration structural data networks analysis generates insight function mechanism evolution biological networks
