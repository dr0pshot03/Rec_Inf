directional switch integrin signalling new anti-thrombotic strategy
integrins critical role thrombosis haemostasis antagonists platelet integrin alphaiibbeta potent anti-thrombotic drugs also life-threatening adverse effect causing bleeding therefore desirable develop new antagonists cause bleeding integrins transmit signals bidirectionally inside-out signalling activates integrins talin-dependent mechanism integrin ligation mediates thrombus formation outside-in signalling requires g alpha greatly expands thrombi show g alpha talin bind mutually exclusive distinct sites within integrin beta cytoplasmic domain opposing waves first talin-binding wave mediates inside-out signalling also ligand-induced integrin activation required outside-in signalling integrin ligation induces transient talin dissociation g alpha binding exe motif x denotes residue selectively mediates outside-in signalling platelet spreading second talin-binding wave associated clot retraction exe-motif-based inhibitor g alpha-integrin interaction selectively abolishes outside-in signalling without affecting integrin ligation suppresses occlusive arterial thrombosis without affecting bleeding time thus discovered new mechanism directional switch integrin signalling basis mechanism designed potent new anti-thrombotic drug cause bleeding
