ultrastrong stiff layered polymer nanocomposites
nanoscale building blocks individually exceptionally strong close ideal defect-free materials however difficult retain ideal properties macroscale composites bottom-up assembly clay/polymer nanocomposite allowed preparation homogeneous optically transparent material planar orientation alumosilicate nanosheets stiffness tensile strength multilayer composites one order magnitude greater analogous nanocomposites processing temperature much lower ceramic polymer materials similar characteristics high level ordering nanoscale building blocks combined dense covalent hydrogen bonding stiffening polymer chains leads highly effective load transfer nanosheets polymer
