essential role bdnf mesolimbic dopamine pathway social defeat stress 
mice experiencing repeated aggression develop long-tasting aversion social contact can normalized chronic acute administration antidepressant using viral-mediated mesolimbic dopamine pathway-specific knockdown brain-derived neurotrophic factor bdnf showed bdnf required development experience-dependent social aversion gene profiling nucleus accumbens indicates local knockdown bdnf obliterates effects repeated aggression gene expression within circuit similar effects produced chronic treatment antidepressant results establish essential rote bdnf mediating long-term neural behavioral plasticity response aversive social experiences
