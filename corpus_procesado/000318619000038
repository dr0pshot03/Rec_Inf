global leaf trait relationships: mass area leaf economics spectrum
leaf economics spectrum les describes multivariate correlations constrain leaf traits plant species primarily single axis variation data normalized leaf mass show traits approximately distributed proportional leaf area instead mass expected light-and carbon dioxide-collecting organ much structure mass-normalized les results normalizing area-proportional traits mass mass normalization induces strong correlations among area-proportional traits large variation among species leaf mass per area lma high lma variance likely reflects functional relationship leaf life span les independent mass-or area-normalization lma reveals physiological relationships inconsistent global vegetation models designed address climate change
