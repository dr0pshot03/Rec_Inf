dimples nanocrystalline fracture surfaces evidence shear plane formation 
tensile experiments fully dense nanocrystalline structures mean grain size less nanometers demonstrate considerable increase hardness remarkable drop elongation-to-failure indicating brittle behavior however dimple structures often observed fracture surface indicating type ductile fracture mechanism guided large-scale atomistic simulations propose dimple structures result local shear planes formed around clustered grains particular misorientation participate grain boundary accommodation processes necessary sustain plastic deformation raises expectation general high-angle grain boundaries necessary good ductility
