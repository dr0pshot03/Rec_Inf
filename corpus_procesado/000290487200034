quantum annealing manufactured spins
many interesting practically intractable problems can reduced finding ground state system interacting spins however finding ground state remains computationally difficult believed ground state naturally occurring spin systems can effectively attained process called quantum annealing harnessed quantum annealing might improve known methods solving certain types problem however physical investigation quantum annealing largely confined microscopic spins condensed-matter systems- use quantum annealing find ground state artificial ising spin system comprising array eight superconducting flux quantum bits programmable spin-spin couplings observe clear signature quantum annealing distinguishable classical thermal annealing temperature dependence time system dynamics freezes implementation can configured situ realize wide variety different spin networks can monitored moves towards low-energy configuration programmable artificial spin network bridges gap theoretical study ideal isolated spin networks experimental investigation bulk magnetic samples moreover increased number spins system may provide practical physical means implement quantum algorithm possibly allowing more-effective approaches solving certain classes hard combinatorial optimization problems
