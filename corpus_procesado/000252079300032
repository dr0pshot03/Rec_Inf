effects acoustic waves stick-slip granular media implications earthquakes 
remains unknown small strains induced seismic waves can trigger earthquakes large distances cases thousands kilometres triggering earthquake failure often occurring long waves passed1- earthquake nucleation usually observed take place depths km static overburden large enough inhibit triggering seismic wave stress perturbations understand physics dynamic triggering better well influence dynamic stressing earthquake recurrence conducted laboratory studies stick slip granular media without applied acoustic vibration glass beads used simulate granular fault zone material sheared constant normal stress subject transient continuous perturbation acoustic waves show small magnitude failure events corresponding triggered aftershocks occur applied sound wave amplitudes exceed several microstrain events frequently delayed occur part cascade small events vibrations also cause large slip events disrupted time relative without wave perturbation effects observed many large event cycles vibrations cease indicating strain memory granular material dynamic stressing tectonic faults may play similar role determining complexity earthquake recurrence
