penultimate deglacial sea-level timing uranium/thorium dating tahitian corals
timing sea-level change provides important constraints mechanisms driving earths climate glacial interglacial states fossil corals constrain timing past sea level suitability dating growth position close sea level coral-derived age last deglaciation consistent climate change forced northern hemisphere summer insolation nhi timing penultimate deglaciation controversial found means uranium/thorium dating fossil corals sea level penultimate deglaciation risen similar meters present sea level years ago fluctuated millennial time scale deglaciation indicates penultimate deglaciation occurred earlier respect nhi last deglacial beginning nhi minimum
