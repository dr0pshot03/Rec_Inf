low-pass dna sequencing sardinians reconstructs european y-chromosome phylogeny
genetic variation within male-specific portion y chromosome msy can clarify origins contemporary populations previous studies hampered partial genetic information population sequencing sardinian males identified msy single-nucleotide polymorphisms previously observed constructed msy phylogenetic tree containing main haplogroups found europe along many sardinian-specific lineage clusters within haplogroup tree calibrated archaeological data initial expansion sardinian population similar years ago ages nodes highlight different genetic strata sardinia reveal presumptive timing coalescence human populations calculate putative age coalescence similar years ago consistent previous mitochondrial dna-based estimates
