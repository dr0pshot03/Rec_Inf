non-equivalent contributions maternal paternal genomes early plant embryogenesis 
zygotic genome activation metazoans typically occurs several hours day fertilization thus maternal rnas proteins drive early animal embryo development1 plants despite several molecular studies post-fertilization transcriptional activation timing zygotic genome activation remains matter debate example two recent reports used different hybrid ecotype combinations rna sequence profiling early arabidopsis embryo transcriptomes came divergent conclusions one identified paternal contributions varied gene overall maternal dominance2 found maternal paternal genomes transcriptionally equivalent3 assess paternal gene activation functionally isogenic background performing large-scale genetic analysis embryo defective genes testing ability wild-type paternal alleles complement phenotypes conditioned mutant maternal alleles results demonstrate wild-type paternal alleles nine genes completely functional days pollination remaining genes showing partial activity beginning days pollination using functional assay also demonstrate different hybrid combinations exhibit significant variation paternal allele activation reconciling apparently contradictory results previous transcriptional studies23 variation timing gene function observe confirms paternal genome activation occur one early discrete step provides large-scale functional evidence maternal paternal genomes make non-equivalent contributions early plant embryogenesis uncovers unexpectedly profound effect hybrid genetic backgrounds paternal gene activity
