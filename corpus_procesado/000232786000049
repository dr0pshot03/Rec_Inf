biochemical architecture ancient adaptive landscape
molecular evolution moving statistical descriptions adaptive molecular changes toward predicting fitness effects mutations characterize fitness landscape six amino acids controlling coenzyme use isopropylmalate dehydrogenase imdh although natural imdhs use nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide nad coenzyme can engineered use nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate nadp instead intermediates two phenotypic extremes show amino acid contributes additively enzyme function epistatic contributions confined fitness genotype-phenotype-fitness map shows nad use global optimum
