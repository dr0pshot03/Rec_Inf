mitochondrial dna stress primes antiviral innate immune response
mitochondrial dna mtdna normally present thousands copies per cell packaged several hundred higher-order structures termed nudeoids abundant mtdna-binding protein tfam transcription factor mitochondrial regulates nucleoid architecture abundance segregation complete mtdna depletion profoundly impairs oxidative phosphorylation triggering calcium-dependent stress signalling adaptive metabolic responses however cellular responses mtdna instability physiologically relevant stress observed many human diseases ageing remain poorly defined show moderate mtdna stress elicited tfam deficiency engages cytosolic antiviral signalling enhance expression subset interferon-stimulated genes mechanistically find aberrant mtdna packaging promotes escape mtdna cytosol engages dna sensor cgas also known mb21d1 promotes sting also known tmem173-irf3-dependent signalling elevate interferon-stimulated gene expression potentiate type interferon responses confer broad viral resistance furthermore demonstrate herpesviruses induce mtdna stress enhances antiviral signalling type interferon responses infection results demonstrate mitochondria central participants innate immunity identify mtdna stress cell-intrinsic trigger antiviral signalling suggest cellular monitoring mtdna homeostasis cooperates canonical virus sensing mechanisms fully engage antiviral innate immunity
