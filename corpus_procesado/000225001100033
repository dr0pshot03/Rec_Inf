jet accretion-disk emission untangled 3c 
long-term spectral variability study 3c data obtained bepposax allows us decouple beamed nonthermal jet unbeamed thermal accretion flow radiation produced inner region radio-loud active galactic nucleus jet power compared unbeamed radiation increases energy thermal component generally overwhelmed nonthermal radiation factor -kev range factor kev one case accretion flow overcomes jet allowing kalpha iron line emerge clearly continuum
