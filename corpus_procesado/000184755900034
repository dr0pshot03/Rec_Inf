-year centennial-scale marine record southern hemisphere climatic oscillation 
order investigate rapid climatic changes mid-southern latitudes developed centennial-scale paleoceanographic records southwest pacific enable detailed comparison antarctic ice core records records suggest close coupling mid-southern latitudes antarctic climate deglacial interglacial periods glacial sections display higher variability seen antarctic ice cores implies climatic decoupling mid high southern latitudes due enhanced circum-antarctic circulation structural temporal similarity greenland ice core record evident glacial sections suggests degree interhemispheric synchroneity predicted bipolar ice core correlations
