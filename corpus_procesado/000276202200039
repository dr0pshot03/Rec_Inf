mantle flow drives subsidence oceanic plates 
subsidence sea floor generally considered consequence passive cooling densifying since formation ridge therefore regarded function lithospheric age however lithosphere defined thermal boundary layer mantle convection thus determine structure examined evolution lithosphere structure depth along trajectories representative underlying mantle flow show along flow lines sea-floor depth varies square root distance ridge given boundary-layer equation along entire plate without flattening contrary previous models additional heat supply required base lithosphere
