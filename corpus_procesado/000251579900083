effect remote sea surface temperature change tropical cyclone potential intensity
response tropical cyclone activity global warming widely debated- often assumed warmer sea surface temperatures provide favourable environment development intensification tropical cyclones cyclone genesis intensity also affected vertical thermodynamic properties atmosphere- use climate models observational reconstructions explore relationship changes sea surface temperature tropical cyclone potential intensity measure provides upper bound cyclone intensity- can also reflect likelihood cyclone development find changes local sea surface temperature inadequate characterizing even sign changes potential intensity long term changes potential intensity closely related regional structure warming regions warm tropical average characterized increased potential intensity vice versa use relationship reconstruct changes potential intensity twentieth century observational reconstructions sea surface temperature find even though tropical atlantic sea surface temperatures currently historical high atlantic potential intensity probably peaked 1930s 1950s recent values near historical average results indicate per unit local sea surface temperature change response tropical cyclone activity natural climate variations tend involve localized changes sea surface temperature may larger response uniform patterns greenhouse gas induced warming
