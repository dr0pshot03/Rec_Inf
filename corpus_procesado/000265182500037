massive hypergiant star progenitor supernova sn 2005gl
understanding evolution massive stars final explosions supernovae incomplete observational theoretical standpoint key missing piece supernova puzzle difficulty identifying studying progenitor stars single case-that supernova sn 1987a large magellanic cloud-has star detected supernova location explosion subsequently shown vanished supernova event progenitor sn 1987a blue supergiant required rethink stellar evolution models progenitor supernova sn 2005gl proposed extremely luminous object association robustly established even clear putative progenitor single luminous star report previously proposed object indeed progenitor star sn 2005gl massive star likely luminous blue variable standard stellar evolution predicts exploded state
