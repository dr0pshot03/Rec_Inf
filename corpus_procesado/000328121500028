ferromagnetism suspensions magnetic platelets liquid crystal
four decades ago brochard de gennes proposed colloidal suspensions ferromagnetic particles nematic directionally ordered liquid crystals form macroscopic ferromagnetic phases room temperature experimental realization predicted phases hitherto proved elusive systems showing enhanced paramagnetism spontaneous magnetization absence external magnetic field show nanometre-sized ferromagnetic platelets suspended nematic liquid crystal can order ferromagnetically quenching isotropic phase cooling absence magnetic field produces polydomain sample exhibiting two opposing states magnetization oriented parallel direction nematic ordering cooling presence magnetic field yields monodomain sample magnetization can switched domain wall movement reversal applied magnetic field ferromagnetic properties dipolar fluid due interplay nematic elastic interaction depends critically shape particles magnetic dipolar interaction ferromagnetic phase responds small magnetic fields may find use magneto-optic devices
