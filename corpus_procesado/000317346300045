succinate inflammatory signal induces il beta hif alpha
macrophages activated gram-negative bacterial product lipopolysaccharide switch core metabolism oxidative phosphorylation glycolysis show inhibition glycolysis deoxyglucose suppresses lipopolysaccharide-induced interleukin beta tumour-necrosis factor-a mouse macrophages comprehensive metabolic map lipopolysaccharide-activated macrophages shows upregulation glycolytic down-regulation mitochondrial genes correlates directly expression profiles altered metabolites lipopolysaccharide strongly increases levels tricarboxylic-acid cycle intermediate succinate glutamine-dependent anerplerosis principal source succinate although gaba gamma-aminobutyric acid shunt pathway also role lipopolysaccharide-induced succinate stabilizes hypoxia-inducible factor alpha effect inhibited deoxyglucose interleukin beta important target lipopolysaccharide also increases succinylation several proteins therefore identify succinate metabolite innate immune signalling enhances interleukin beta production inflammation
