impossibility deleting unknown quantum state 
photon arbitrary polarization state cloned perfectly12 suppose disposal several copies photon unknown state possible delete information content one photons physical process specifically two photons initial polarization state mechanism produces one photon initial state standard polarization state done one create standard blank state onto one copy unknown state approximately deterministic cloning34 exactly probabilistic cloning56 principle useful quantum computation one store new information already computed state deleting old information show however linearity quantum theory allow us delete copy arbitrary quantum state perfectly though classical computer information can deleted reversibly copy7 analogous task accomplished even irreversibly quantum information
