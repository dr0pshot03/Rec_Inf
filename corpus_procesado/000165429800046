variation reversibility evolution
reversible adaptive evolution- studies microbes give mixed answers question- reverse evolution little studied sexual populations- even though population genetics sexual populations may quite different present study diverged replicated populations drosophila melanogaster returned common ancestral environment generations show reverse evolution back ancestral state occurs universal instead depending previous evolutionary history character studied hybrid populations showed greater tendency undergo successful reverse evolution suggesting insufficient genetic variation factor limiting reverse evolution adaptive reverse evolution contingent process occurs generations sexual reproduction
