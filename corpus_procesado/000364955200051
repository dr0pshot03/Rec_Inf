patrolling monocytes control tumor metastasis lung
immune system plays important role regulating tumor growth metastasis classical monocytes promote tumorigenesis cancer metastasis nonclassical patrolling monocytes pmo interact tumors unknown show pmo enriched microvasculature lung reduce tumor metastasis lung multiple mouse metastatic tumor models nr4a1-deficient mice specifically lack pmo showed increased lung metastasis vivo transfer nr4a1-proficient pmo nr4a1-deficient mice prevented tumor invasion lung pmo established early interactions metastasizing tumor cells scavenged tumor material lung vasculature promoted natural killer cell recruitment activation thus pmo contribute cancer immunosurveillance may targets cancer immunotherapy
