constraints volatile distribution within shackleton crater lunar south pole 
shackleton crater nearly coincident moons south pole interior receives almost direct sunlight perennial cold trap making shackleton promising candidate location seek sequestered volatiles however previous orbital earth-based radar mapping- orbital optical imaging yielded conflicting interpretations existence volatiles present observations lunar orbiter laser altimeter board lunar reconnaissance orbiter revealing shackleton ancient unusually well-preserved simple crater whose interior walls fresher floor rim shackleton floor deposits nearly age rim suggesting little floor deposition occurred since crater formed three billion years ago wavelength nanometres floor shackleton brighter surrounding terrain interiors nearby craters bright interior walls combined observations explicable primarily downslope movement regolith walls exposing fresher underlying material relatively brighter crater floor simply explained decreased space weathering due shadowing one-micrometre-thick layer containing per cent surficial ice alternative possibility
