transcript-rna-templated dna recombination repair 
homologous recombination molecular process multiple important roles dna metabolism dna repair genetic variation forms life1 generally homologous recombination involves exchange genetic information two identical nearly identical dna molecules1; however homologous recombination can also occur rna molecules shown rna viruses2 previous research showed synthetic rna oligonudeotides can act templates dna double-strand break dsb repair yeast human cells34 artificial long rna templates injected ciliate cells can guide genomic rearrangements5 report endogenous transcript rna mediates homologous recombination chromosomal dna yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae developed system detect events homologous recombination initiated transcript rna following repair chromosomal dsb occurring either homologous remote locus transcript-generating locus reverse-transcription-defective yeast strains found rna-dna recombination blocked ribonudeases h1 h2 presence h-type ribonudeases dsb repair proceeds complementary dna intermediate whereas absence proceeds directly rna proximity transcript chromosomal dna partner locus facilitates rad52-driven homologous recombination dsb repair demonstrate yeast human rad52 proteins efficiently catalyse annealing rna dsb-like dna end vitro results reveal novel mechanism homologous recombination dna repair transcript rna used template dsb repair thus considering abundance rna transcripts cells rna may marked impact genomic stability plasticity
