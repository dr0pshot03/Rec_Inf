mechanism influenza virus nucleoprotein forms oligomers binds rna
influenza viruses pose serious threat world public health particularly currently circulating avian h5n1 viruses influenza viral nucleoprotein forms protein scaffold helical genomic ribonucleoprotein complexes critical role viral rna replication report angstrom crystal structure nucleoprotein overall shape resembles crescent head body domain protein fold different compared rhabdovirus nucleoprotein oligomerization influenza virus nucleoprotein mediated flexible tail loop inserted inside neighbouring molecule flexibility tail loop enables nucleoprotein form loose polymers well rigid helices important nucleoprotein functions single residue mutations tail loop result complete loss nucleoprotein oligomerization rna-binding groove found head body domains exterior nucleoprotein oligomer lined highly conserved basic residues widely distributed primary sequence nucleoprotein structure shows one two proposed nuclear localization signals accessible suggests body domain nucleoprotein contains binding site viral polymerase results identify tail loop binding pocket potential target antiviral development
