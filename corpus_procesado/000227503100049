osbp cholesterol-regrulated scaffolding protein control erk1/ activation
oxysterol-binding protein osbp founding member family sterol-binding proteins implicated vesicle transport lipid metabolism signal transduction osbp found function cholesterol-binding scaffolding protein coordinating activity two phosphatases control extracellular signal-regulated kinase erk signaling pathway cytosolic osbp formed similar to440-kilodalton oligomer member ptppbs family tyrosine phosphatases serine/threonine phosphatase pp2a cholesterol oligomer dual specific phosphatase activity phosphorylated erk perk cell cholesterol lowered oligomer disassembled level perk rose oligomer also disassembled exposed oxysterols increasing amount osbp oligomer rendered cells resistant effects cholesterol depletion decreased basal level perk thus cholesterol functions interaction osbp outside membranes regulate assembly oligomeric phosphatase controls key signaling pathway cell
