gas cloud way towards supermassive black hole galactic centre 
measurements stellar orbits- provide compelling evidence compact radio source sagittarius a* galactic centre black hole four million times mass sun exception modest x-ray infrared flares sgr a* surprisingly faint suggesting accretion rate radiation efficiency near event horizon currently low report presence dense gas cloud approximately three times mass earth falling accretion zone sgr a* observations tightly constrain clouds orbit highly eccentric innermost radius approach similar times event horizon will reached past three years cloud begun disrupt probably mainly tidal shearing arising black holes gravitational force clouds dynamic evolution radiation next years will probe properties accretion flow feeding processes supermassive black hole kilo-electronvolt x-ray emission sgr a* may brighten significantly cloud reaches pericentre may also giant radiation flare several years now cloud breaks fragments feed gas central accretion zone
