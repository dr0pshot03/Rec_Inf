label-free immunodetection cmos-compatible semiconducting nanowires 
semiconducting nanowires potential function highly sensitive selective sensors label-free detection low concentrations pathogenic microorganisms- successful solution-phase nanowire sensing demonstrated ions small molecules proteins dna viruses however bottom-up nanowires similarly configured carbon nanotubes used demonstrations require hybrid fabrication schemes result severe integration issues hindered widespread application alternative top-down fabrication methods nanowire-like devices- produce disappointing performance process-induced material device degradation report approach uses complementary metal oxide semiconductor cmos field effect transistor compatible technology hence demonstrate specific label-free detection femtomolar concentrations antibodies well real-time monitoring cellular immune response approach eliminates need hybrid methods enables system-scale integration sensors signal processing information systems additionally ability monitor antibody binding sense cellular immune response real time readily available technology facilitate widespread diagnostic applications
