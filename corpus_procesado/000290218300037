disc1-dependent switch progenitor proliferation migration developing cortex
regulatory mechanisms governing sequence progenitor cell proliferation neuronal migration corticogenesis poorly understood- report phosphorylation disc1 major susceptibility factor several mental disorders acts molecular switch maintaining proliferation mitotic progenitor cells activating migration postmitotic neurons mice unphosphorylated disc1 regulates canonical wnt signalling via interaction gsk3 beta whereas specific phosphorylation serine s710 triggers recruitment bardet-biedl syndrome bbs proteins centrosome support model loss bbs1 leads defects migration proliferation whereas disc1 knockdown leads deficits phospho-dead mutant can rescue proliferation whereas phospho-mimic mutant rescues exclusively migration defects data highlight dual role disc1 corticogenesis indicate phosphorylation protein s710 activates key developmental switch
