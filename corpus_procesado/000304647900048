evolution vertebrate social decision-making network
animals evaluate respond social environment adaptive decisions revealing neural mechanisms decisions major goal biology analyzed expression profiles neurochemical genes across brain regions important decision-making species representing five vertebrate lineages found behaviorally relevant brain regions remarkably conserved million years evolution also find evidence different brain regions experienced different selection pressures spatial distribution neuroendocrine ligands flexible receptors across vertebrates analysis suggests diversity social behavior vertebrates can explained part variations theme conserved neural gene expression networks
