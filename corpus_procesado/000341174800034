temperature sensitivity soil respiration rates enhanced microbial community response 
soils store four times much carbon plant biomass soil microbial respiration releases petagrams carbon per year atmosphere carbon dioxide short-term experiments shown soil microbial respiration increases exponentially temperature information incorporated soil carbon earth-system models suggest warming-induced increases carbon dioxide release soils represent important positive feedback loop influence twenty-first-century climate change magnitude feedback remains uncertain however least response soil microbial communities changing temperatures potential either decrease- increase warming-induced carbon losses substantially collect soils different ecosystems along climate gradient arctic amazon investigate microbial community-level responses control temperature sensitivity soil respiration find microbial community-level response often enhances reduces mid-to long-term days temperature sensitivity respiration furthermore strongest enhancing responses observed soils high carbon-to-nitrogen ratios soils cold climatic regions days microbial community responses increased temperature sensitivity respiration high-latitude soils factor compared instantaneous temperature response suggests substantial carbon stores arctic boreal soils vulnerable climate warming currently predicted
