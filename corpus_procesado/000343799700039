minimal cadherin-catenin complex binds actin filaments force 
linkage adherens junction aj actin cytoskeleton required tissue development homeostasis vivo findings indicated aj proteins e-cadherin beta-catenin filamentous f-actin binding protein alpha e-catenin form minimal cadherin-catenin complex binds directly f-actin biochemical studies challenged model purified cadherin-catenin complex bind f-actin solution reconciled difference using optical trap-based assay showed minimal cadherin-catenin complex formed stable bonds actin filament force bond dissociation kinetics can explained catch-bond model force shifts bond weakly strongly bound state results may explain cadherin-catenin complex transduces mechanical forces cell-cell junctions
