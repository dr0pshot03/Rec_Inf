self-cooling micromirror radiation pressure 
cooling mechanical resonators currently popular topic many fields physics including ultra-high precision measurements detection gravitational waves study transition classical quantum behaviour mechanical system- report observation self-cooling micromirror radiation pressure inside high-finesse optical cavity essence changes intensity detuned cavity caused thermal vibration mirror provide mechanism entropy flow mirrors oscillatory motion low-entropy cavity field crucial coupling radiation mechanical motion made possible producing freestanding micromirrors low mass m approximate ng high reflectance % high mechanical quality q approximate observe cooling mechanical oscillator factor room temperature k addition purely photothermal effects identify radiation pressure relevant mechanism responsible cooling contrast earlier experiments technique need active feedback- expect improvements method will permit cooling ratios beyond will thus possibly enable cooling way quantum mechanical ground state micromirror
