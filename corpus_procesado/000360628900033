predator-prey power law: biomass scaling across terrestrial aquatic biomes 
ecosystems exhibit surprising regularities structure function across terrestrial aquatic biomes worldwide assembled global data set communities large mammals invertebrates plants plankton find predator prey biomass follow general scaling law exponents consistently near / pervasive pattern implies structure biomass pyramid becomes increasingly bottom-heavy higher biomass similar exponents obtained community production-biomass relations suggesting conserved links ecosystem structure function exponents similar many body mass allometries yet ecosystem scaling emerges independently individual-level scaling fully understood patterns suggest greater degree ecosystem-level organization previously recognized predictive approach ecological theory
