sex-dependent gene expression evolution drosophila transcriptome 
comparison gene-expression profiles adults drosophila melanogaster drosophila simulans uncovered evolution genes exhibit sex-dependent regulation approximately half genes showed differences expression species among similar to83% involved gain loss increase decrease reversal sex-biased expression interspecific differences messenger rna abundance affect male-biased genes genes differ expression species showed functional clustering sex-biased results suggest sex-dependent selection may drive changes expression many rapidly evolving genes drosophila transcriptome
