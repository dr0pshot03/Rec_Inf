optically healable supramolecular polymers
polymers ability repair sustaining damage extend lifetimes materials used many applications approaches healable materials require heating damaged area- present metallosupramolecular polymers can mended exposure light consist telechelic rubbery low-molecular-mass polymers ligand end groups non-covalently linked metal-ion binding exposure ultraviolet light metal-ligand motifs electronically excited absorbed energy converted heat causes temporary disengagement metal-ligand motifs concomitant reversible decrease polymers molecular mass viscosity thereby allowing quick efficient defect healing light can applied locally damage site objects can principle healed load anticipate approach healable materials based supramolecular polymers light-heat conversion step can applied wide range supramolecular materials use different chemistries
