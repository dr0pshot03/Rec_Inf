zero-mode waveguides single-molecule analysis high concentrations 
optical approaches observing dynamics single molecules required pico nanomolar concentrations fluorophore order isolate individual molecules however many biologically relevant processes occur micromolar ligand concentrations necessitating reduction conventional observation volume three orders magnitude show arrays zero-mode waveguides consisting subwavelength holes metal film provide simple highly parallel means studying single-molecule dynamics micromolar concentrations microsecond temporal resolution present observations dna polymerase activity example effectiveness zero-mode waveguides performing single-molecule experiments high concentrations
