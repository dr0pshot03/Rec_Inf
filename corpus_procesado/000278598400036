stochastic community assembly causes higher biodiversity productive environments 
net primary productivity principal driver biodiversity; large-scale regions higher productivity generally species pattern emerges beta-diversity compositional variation across local sites increases productivity mechanisms underlying phenomenon unknown using data long-term experiment replicate ponds show higher beta-diversity higher productivity resulted stronger role stochastic relative deterministic assembly processes increasing productivity shift relative importance stochasticity consistent hypothesis intense priority effects leading multiple stable equilibria higher productivity thus shifts community assembly mechanisms across productivity gradient may underlie one prominent biodiversity gradients planet
