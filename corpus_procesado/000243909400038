single photon-induced symmetry breaking h- dissociation 
h- smallest abundant molecule universe perfectly symmetric ground state take break symmetry found inversion symmetry can broken absorption linearly polarized photon inversion symmetry particular emission photoelectron subsequent dissociation remaining h-+ fragment shows symmetry respect ionic h+ neutral h atomic fragments lack symmetry results entanglement symmetric antisymmetric h-+ states caused autoionization mechanisms behind symmetry breaking general molecules
