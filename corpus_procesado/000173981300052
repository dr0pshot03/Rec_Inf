enzyme dynamics catalysis 
internal protein dynamics intimately connected enzymatic catalysis however enzyme motions linked substrate turnover remain largely unknown studied dynamics enzyme catalysis atomic resolution using nuclear magnetic resonance relaxation methods catalytic action enzyme cyclophilin detect conformational fluctuations active site occur time scale hundreds microseconds rates conformational dynamics enzyme strongly correlate microscopic rates substrate turnover present results together available structural data allow prediction reaction trajectory
