evidence ad izu islands earthquake swarm stressing rate governs seismicity 
magma intrusions eruptions commonly produce abrupt changes seismicity far magma conduits- associated diffusion pore fluids heat swarm seismicity also migrates time often exhibits dog-bone-shaped distribution- largest earthquakes swarms produce aftershocks obey omori-type exponential temporal decay- duration aftershock sequences drastically reduced relative normal earthquake activity use one energetic swarms ever recorded study dependence properties stress imparted magma intrusion -fold increase seismicity rate -fold decrease aftershock duration occurred two-month-long dyke intrusion find seismicity rate proportional calculated stressing rate duration aftershock sequences inversely proportional stressing rate behaviour accord laboratory-based rate/state constitutive law suggesting explanation occurrence earthquake swarms sustained increase stressing rate-whether due intrusion extrusion creep event-should produce seismological behaviour
