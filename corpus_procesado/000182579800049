diverse plant animal genetic records holocene pleistocene sediments 
genetic analyses permafrost temperate sediments reveal plant animal dna may preserved long periods even absence obvious macrofossils siberia five permafrost cores ranging years old contained least different plant taxa including oldest authenticated ancient dna sequences known megafaunal sequences including mammoth bison horse genetic data record number dramatic changes taxonomic diversity composition beringian vegetation fauna temperate cave sediments new zealand also yielded dna sequences extinct biota including two species ratite moa plant taxa characteristic prehuman environment therefore many sedimentary deposits may contain unique widespread genetic records paleoenvironments
