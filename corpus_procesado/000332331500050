mapping epigenetic basis complex traits
quantifying impact heritable epigenetic variation complex traits emerging challenge population genetics analyze population isogenic arabidopsis lines segregate experimentally induced dna methylation changes hundreds regions across genome demonstrate several differentially methylated regions dmrs act bona fide epigenetic quantitative trait loci qtlepi accounting % heritability two complex traits flowering time primary root length qtlepi reproducible can subjected artificial selection many experimentally induced dmrs also variable natural populations species may thus provide epigenetic basis darwinian evolution independently dna sequence changes
