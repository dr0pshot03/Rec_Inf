measurement-induced relative-position localization entanglement
consider localization pair particles relative-position space show sequence scattering interactions progressively entangles two particles giving rise robust state well-defined separation thus providing natural description relative position use two thought experiments describe localization process first interferometer recoiling mirrors second general case considers photons scattering pair particles resulting emergence youngs interference pattern underlying framework localization process suggests prominent role entanglement relative observables boundary quantum classical mechanics
