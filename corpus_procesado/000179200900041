variability el nino/southern oscillation enso holocene epoch particular millennial timescales poorly understood palaeoclimate studies documented enso variability selected intervals holocene records either short insufficiently resolved investigate variability millennial scales- present record sedimentation laguna pallcacocha southern ecuador strongly influenced enso variability covers past years continuously find changes timescale years attribute warm enso events become frequent holocene years ago decline towards present periods relatively high low enso activity alternating timescale years superimposed long-term trend attribute long-term trend orbitally induced changes insolation suggest internal enso dynamics possible cause millennial variability however millennial oscillation will need confirmed enso proxy records
