periodic table protein structures 
current structural genomics programs aim systematically determine structures proteins coded human genomes providing complete picture number variety protein structures exist past estimates made basis incomplete sample structures currently known estimates varied greatly see example refs partly limited sample size also owing difficulties distinguishing one structure another distinction usually topological based fold protein however strict topological terms neglecting consider intra-chain cross-links protein chains open strings hence identical avoid trivial result topologies determined considering secondary links form intra-chain hydrogen bonds secondary structure tertiary links formed packing secondary structures however small additions loss structure can make large changes perceived topologies subjective solutions neither robust amenable automation formalize secondary tertiary links allow rigorous automatic definition protein topology
