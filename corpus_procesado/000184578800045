neural correlates implied motion 
current views visual system assume primate brain analyses form motion along largely independent pathways1; provide insight form sometimes interpreted motion series psychophysical electrophysiological experiments humans macaques show form information processed prototypical motion areas superior temporal sulcus sts first show sts cells respond dynamic glass patterns2which contain coherent motion suggest path motion3 second show motion signals conflict form signals suggesting different path motion humans monkeys perceive motion compromised direction compromise also correlate responses sts cells alter direction preferences presence conflicting implied motion information conclude cells prototypical motion areas dorsal visual cortex process form implies motion estimating motion combining motion cues form cues may strategy deal complexities motion perception natural environment
