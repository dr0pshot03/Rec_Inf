binding dcc netrin mediate axon guidance independent adenosine a2b receptor activation
netrins stimulate orient axon growth mechanism requiring receptors dcc family unclear however whether dcc proteins involved directly signaling mere accessory proteins receptor complex although netrins bind cells expressing dcc direct binding dcc demonstrated show netrin binds dcc dcc cytoplasmic domain fused heterologous receptor ectodomain can mediate guidance mechanism involving derepression cytoplasmic domain multimerization activation adenosine a2b receptor proposed contribute netrin effects axons required rat commissural axon outgrowth xenopus spinal axon attraction netrin-: thus dcc plays central role netrin signaling axon growth guidance independent a2b receptor activation
