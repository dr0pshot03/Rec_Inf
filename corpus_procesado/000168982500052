presynaptic glycine receptors enhance transmitter release mammalian central synapse
glycine gabaa gamma aminobutyric acid receptors inhibitory neurotransmitter-gated cl channels localized postsynaptic membranes cases gabaa receptors also found presynaptically retain inhibitory effect activation reduces excitatory transmitter release- report evidence presynaptic ionotropic glycine receptors using pre postsynaptic recordings calyceal synapse medial nucleus trapezoid body mntb unlike classical action glycine presynaptic glycine receptors triggered weakly depolarizing cl current nerve terminal depolarization enhanced transmitter release activating ca2+ channels increasing resting intraterminal ca2+ concentrations repetitive activation glycinergic synapses mntb neurons also enhanced glutamatergic synaptic currents indicating presynaptic glycine receptors activated glycine spillover results reveal novel site action transmitter glycine indicate certain conditions presynaptic cl channels may increase transmitter release
