forced unfolding proteins within cells
identify cytoskeletal proteins change conformation assembly within stressed cells situ labeling sterically shielded cysteines fluorophores analyzed fluorescence imaging quantitative mass spectrometry sequential two-dye labeling within red blood cells shotgun labeling showed shielded cysteines two isoforms cytoskeletal protein spectrin increasingly labeled function shear stress time indicative forced unfolding specific domains within mesenchymal stem cells-as prototypical adherent cell-nonmuscle myosin iia vimentin just two cytoskeletal proteins identified show differential labeling tensed versus drug-relaxed cells cysteine labeling proteins within live cells can thus used fluorescently map sites molecular-scale deformation results also suggest means colocalize signaling events phosphorylation forced unfolding
