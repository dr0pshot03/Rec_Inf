oscillatory mass transport vapor-liquid-solid growth sapphire nanowires
vapor-liquid-solid vls growth liquid phase plays pivotal role mediating mass transport vapor source growth front nanowire transport often takes place liquid phase however observed situ transmission electron microscopy different behavior self-catalytic vls growth sapphire nanowires growth occurs layer-by-layer fashion accomplished interfacial diffusion oxygen ordered liquid aluminum atoms oscillatory growth dissolution reactions top rim nanowires occur supply oxygen required grow new sapphire layer periodic modulation vls triple-junction configuration accompanies oscillatory reactions
