all-optical routing single photons one-atom switch controlled single photon
prospect quantum networks quantum information carried single photons photonic circuits long driving force behind effort achieve all-optical routing single photons realized single-photon-activated switch capable routing photon two inputs two outputs device based single atom coupled fiber-coupled chip-based microresonator single reflected control photon toggles switch high reflection r similar % high transmission t similar % average similar control photons per switching event similar including linear losses additional control fields required control target photons in-fiber practically identical making scheme compatible scalable architectures quantum information processing
