fastest unbound star galaxy ejected thermonuclear supernova 
hypervelocity stars hvss travel velocities high exceed escape velocity galaxy several acceleration mechanisms discussed one hvs us hvs compact helium star present spectroscopic kinematic analysis us traveling velocity similar kilometers per second fastest unbound star galaxy reconstructing trajectory galactic center becomes unlikely origin hardly consistent favored ejection mechanism hvss furthermore detected us fast rotator according binary evolution model spun-up tidal interaction close binary likely ejected donor remnant thermonuclear supernova
