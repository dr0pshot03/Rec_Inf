structural basis trans-inhibition molybdate/tungstate abc transporter 
transport across cellular membranes essential process catalyzed diverse membrane transport proteins turnover rates certain transporters inhibited substrates process termed trans inhibition whose structural basis poorly understood present crystal structure molybdate/ tungstate abc transporter modbc methanosarcina acetivorans trans inhibited state regulatory domains nucleotide binding subunits close contact provide two oxyanion binding pockets shared interface specifically binding pockets molybdate tungstate prevent adenosine triphosphatase activity lock transporter inward facing conformation catalytic motifs nucleotide binding domains separated allosteric effect prevents transporter switching inward facing outward facing states thus interfering alternating access release mechanism
