activity-dependent regulation mef2 transcription factors suppresses excitatory synapse number 
mammalian nervous system neuronal activity regulates strength number synapses formed genetic program coordinates process poorly understood show myocyte enhancer factor mef2 transcription factors suppressed excitatory synapse number neuronal activity calcineurin-dependent manner hippocampal neurons formed synapses response increased neuronal activity calcium influx neurons induced activation calcium/calmodulin-regulated phosphatase calcineurin dephosphorylated activated mef2 activated mef2 promoted transcription set genes including arc syngap restrict synapse number findings define activity-dependent transcriptional program may control synapse number development
