north atlantic spring phytoplankton bloom sverdrups critical depth hypothesis 
years ago harald sverdrup developed simple model necessary conditions leading spring bloom phytoplankton although model used extensively across variety aquatic ecosystems application requires knowledge community compensation irradiance i-c light [eve[ photosynthetic ecosystem community loss processes balance however reported i-c values varied order magnitude i-c estimates determined using satellite hydrographic data sets consistent assumptions sverdrups critical depth hypothesis retrieved values i-c approximately uniform throughout much north atlantic mean value mol photons meter- day- community-based i-c determinations roughly twice typical values found phytoptankton alone indicating phytoplankton account approximately one-half community ecosystem losses work also suggests important aspects heterotrophic community dynamics can assessed using satellite observations
