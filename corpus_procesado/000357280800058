catalytic asymmetric hydroamination unactivated internal olefins aliphatic amines
catalytic assembly enantiopure aliphatic amines abundant readily available precursors long recognized paramount challenge synthetic chemistry describe mild general copper-catalyzed hydroamination effectively converts unactivated internal olefins-an important yet unexploited class abundant feedstock chemicals-into highly enantioenriched a-branched amines > % enantiomeric excess featuring two minimally differentiated aliphatic substituents method provides powerful means access broad range advanced highly functionalized enantioenriched amines interest pharmaceutical research areas
