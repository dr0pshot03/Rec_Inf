adipose tissue mass determined storage removal triglycerides adipocytes little known however adipose lipid turnover humans health pathology study vivo determined lipid age measuring c derived ground nuclear bomb tests adipocyte lipids report average ten-year lifespan human adipocytes triglycerides renewed six times lipid age independent adipocyte size stable across wide range adult ages differ genders adipocyte lipid turnover however strongly related conditions disturbed lipid metabolism obesity triglyceride removal rate lipolysis followed oxidation decreased amount triglycerides stored year increased contrast lipid removal storage rates decreased non-obese patients diagnosed common hereditary form dyslipidaemia familial combined hyperlipidaemia lipid removal rate positively correlated capacity adipocytes break triglycerides assessed lipolysis inversely related insulin resistance data support mechanism adipocyte lipid storage removal different roles health pathology high storage low triglyceride removal promotes fat tissue accumulation obesity reduction triglyceride storage removal decreases lipid shunting adipose tissue thus promotes dyslipidaemia identify adipocyte lipid turnover novel target prevention treatment metabolic disease
