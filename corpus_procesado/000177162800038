evolution inaccurate mimics 
instances strikingly accurate batesian mimicry palatable prey organism closely resembles aversive model often cited illustrate power natural selection less attention paid mimics many hoverfly syrphidae mimics wasps bees resemble models poorly- attempts provide adaptive explanation imperfect mimicry suggested seems crude resemblance human observers may appear close match predators inaccurate mimics may bear general resemblance several different model species show however truly inaccurate mimicry single model organism may favoured perfect resemblance kin selection signal detection theory predicts predators will modify level discrimination adaptively response relative frequencies similarity models mimics- models rare and/or weakly aversive greater local similarity mimics can thus lead greater attack rates individual mimics related others vicinity kin selection will oppose evolution accurate mimicry
