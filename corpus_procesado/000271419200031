oestrogen-receptor-alpha-bound human chromatin interactome
genomes organized high-level three-dimensional structures dna elements separated long genomic distances can principle interact functionally many transcription factors bind regulatory dna elements distant gene promoters although distal binding sites shown regulate transcription long-range chromatin interactions loci chromatin interactions impact transcription regulation investigated genome-wide manner describe development new strategy chromatin interaction analysis paired-end tag sequencing chia-pet de novo detection global chromatin interactions comprehensively mapped chromatin interaction network bound oestrogen receptor alpha er-alpha human genome found high-confidence remote er-alpha-binding sites anchored gene promoters long-range chromatin interactions suggesting er-alpha functions extensive chromatin looping bring genes together coordinated transcriptional regulation propose chromatin interactions constitute primary mechanism regulating transcription mammalian genomes
