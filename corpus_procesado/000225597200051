early blastomere determines embryo proliferation caste fate polyembryonic wasp 
polyembryonic development unique mode metazoan development single zygote generates multiple embryos clonal proliferation1 polyembryonic parasitic insect copidosoma floridanum shows one extreme cases polyembryony producing embryos single egg addition wasp exhibits unusual polyphenism producing two morphologically distinct larval castes termed precocious reproductive develop clonally zygote2 form development seems incompatible model insect development maternal prepatterning egg specifies embryonic axial polarity3 show maternal pre-patterning form germ plasm creates cellular asymmetry four-cell stage embryo copidosoma perpetuated throughout development laser ablations cells show cell inheriting germ plasm regulates fate proliferation reproductive caste thus uncovered new mechanism caste specification mediated regulatory capacity single cell study shows evolution mammalian-like regulative development insect embryo relies novel cellular context might ultimately enhance developmental plasticity
