all-optical magnetic resonance semiconductors 
scheme proposed wherein nuclear magnetic resonance nmr can induced monitored using optical fields analogy radio-frequency fields used traditional nmr circularly polarized light creates electron spins semiconductors whose hyperfine coupling tip nuclear moments time-resolved faraday rotation experiments performed frequency electron larmor precession used magnetometer local magnetic fields experienced electrons n-type gallium arsenide electron spin excitation periodic optical pulse train appears prepare hyperpolarized nuclear moment also destroy resonantly magnetic fields proportional pulse frequency resonant behavior many ways supportive simple model optically induced nmr curious discrepancy one observed frequencies classic nmr values suggests phenomenon complex
