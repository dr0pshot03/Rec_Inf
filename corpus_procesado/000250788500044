rheb activates mtor antagonizing endogenous inhibitor fkbp38
mammalian target rapamycin mtor central regulator cell growth activity regulated rheb ras-like small guanosine triphosphatase gtpase response growth factor stimulation nutrient availability show rheb regulates mtor fkbp38 member fk506-binding protein fkbp family structurally related fkbp12 fkbp38 binds mtor inhibits activity manner similar fkbp12-rapamycin complex rheb interacts directly fkbp38 prevents association mtor guanosine -triphosphate gtp-dependent manner findings suggest fkbp38 endogenous inhibitor mtor whose inhibitory activity antagonized rheb response growth factor stimulation nutrient availability
