tauopathy drosophila: neurodegeneration without neurofibrillary tangles
microtubule-binding protein tau implicated pathogenesis alzheimers disease related disorders however mechanisms underlying tau-mediated neurotoxicity remain unclear created genetic model tau-related neurodegenerative disease expressing wild-type mutant forms human tau fruit fly drosophila melanogaster transgenic flies showed key features human disorders: adult onset progressive neurodegeneration early death enhanced toxicity mutant tau accumulation abnormal tau relative anatomic selectivity however neurodegeneration occurred without neurofibrillary tangle formation seen human disease rodent tauopathy models fly model may allow genetic analysis cellular mechanisms underlying tau neurotoxicity
