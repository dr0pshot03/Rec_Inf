low-magnetic-field soft gamma repeater 
soft gamma repeaters sgrs anomalous x-ray pulsars form rapidly increasing group x-ray sources exhibiting sporadic emission short bursts believed magnetars neutron stars powered extreme magnetic fields b similar gauss report soft gamma repeater low magnetic field sgr + recently detected emitted bursts similar magnetars x-ray observations show dipolar magnetic field greater x gauss well range ordinary radio pulsars implying high surface dipolar magnetic field necessarily required magnetar-like activity magnetar population may thus include objects wider range b-field strengths ages evolutionary stages observed far
