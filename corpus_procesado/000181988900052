rapid actin transport cell protrusion 
transformed rat fibroblasts expressing two variants green fluorescent protein fused beta-actin used study actin dynamics cell protrusion recently developed flap fluorescence localization photobleaching method permits tracking one fluorophore localized photobleaching using colocalized reference visualizing ratio bleached total molecules found actin delivered protruding zones leading edge cell speeds exceeded micrometers per second monte carlo modeling confirmed flow explained diffusion may involve active transport
