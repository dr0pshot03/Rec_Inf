cyclical dna methylation transcriptionally active promoter
processes regulate gene transcription directly influence genome organization epigenome contains additional information brought dna sequence generates spatial functional constraints complement genetic instructions dna methylation cpgs constitutes epigenetic mark generally correlated transcriptionally silent condensed chromatin replication methylation patterns dna methyltransferases maintains genome stability cell division present evidence unanticipated dynamic role dna methylation gene regulation human cells periodic strand specific methylation/ demethylation occurs transcriptional cycling ps2/tff1 gene promoter activation oestrogens dna methyltransferases exhibit dual actions cycles involved cpg methylation active demethylation 5mcpgs deamination inhibition process precludes demethylation ps2 gene promoter subsequent transcriptional activation cyclical changes methylation status promoter cpgs may thus represent critical event transcriptional achievement
