rapid disappearance warm dusty circumstellar disk 
stars form gaseous dusty circumstellar envelopes rapidly settle disks eventually give rise planetary systems understanding process disks evolve paramount developing accurate theory planet formation can account variety planetary systems discovered far formation earth-like planets collisional accumulation rocky objects within disk mainly explored theoretical computational work post-collision ejecta evolution typically ignored- although recent work considered fate material report observations young sun-like star tyc infrared flux post-collisional ejecta decreased drastically factor period less two years star seems gone hosting substantial quantities dusty ejecta region analogous rocky planets orbit solar system retaining meagre amount cooler dust phase rapid ejecta evolution previously predicted observed currently available physical model satisfactorily explains observations
