penumbral structure outflows simulated sunspots
sunspots concentrations magnetic field visible solar surface strongly affect convective energy transport interior surroundings filamentary outer regions penumbrae sunspots show systematic radial outward flows along channels nearly horizontal magnetic field flows discovered years ago present fully developed sunspots using comprehensive numerical simulation sunspot pair show penumbral structures outflows form average magnetic field inclination vertical exceeds degrees systematic outflows component convective flows provide upward energy transport result anisotropy introduced presence inclined magnetic field
