corticomotoneuronal cells functionally tuned
corticomotoneuronal cm cells primary motor cortex m1 monosynaptic connections motoneurons one sources descending commands directly influence motor output examined contribution cm cells generation activity target muscles preferred direction many cm cells differed target muscles cm cells selectively active muscle used agonist others selectively active muscle used synergist fixator antagonist observations suggest different functional uses muscle generated separate populations cm cells propose muscle function one dimensions represented output m1
