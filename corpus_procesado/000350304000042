dietary emulsifiers impact mouse gut microbiota promoting colitis metabolic syndrome
intestinal tract inhabited large diverse community microbes collectively referred gut microbiota gut microbiota provides important benefits host especially metabolism immune development disturbance microbiota-host relationship associated numerous chronic inflammatory diseases including inflammatory bowel disease group obesity-associated diseases collectively referred metabolic syndrome primary means intestine protected microbiota via multi-layered mucus structures cover intestinal surface thereby allowing vast majority gut bacteria kept safe distance epithelial cells line intestine thus agents disrupt mucus-bacterial interactions might potential promote diseases associated gut inflammation consequently hypothesized emulsifiers detergent-like molecules ubiquitous component processed foods can increase bacterial translocation across epithelia vitro might promoting increase inflammatory bowel disease observed since mid-twentieth century report mice relatively low concentrations two commonly used emulsifiers namely carboxymethylcellulose polysorbate- induced low-grade inflammation obesity/metabolic syndrome wild-type hosts promoted robust colitis mice predisposed disorder emulsifier-induced metabolic syndrome associated microbiota encroachment altered species composition increased pro-inflammatory potential use germ-free mice faecal transplants indicated changes microbiota necessary sufficient low-grade inflammation metabolic syndrome results support emerging concept perturbed host-microbiota interactions resulting low-grade inflammation can promote adiposity associated metabolic effects moreover suggest broad use emulsifying agents might contributing increased societal incidence obesity/metabolic syndrome chronic inflammatory diseases
