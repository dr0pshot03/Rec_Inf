f-box protein tir1 auxin receptor
plant hormone auxin regulates diverse aspects plant growth development recent studies indicate auxin acts promoting degradation aux/iaa transcriptional repressors action ubiquitin protein ligase scftir1 nature signalling cascade leads effect known however recent studies indicate auxin receptor signalling components involved response soluble factors using vitro pull-down assay demonstrate interaction transport inhibitor response tir1 aux/iaa proteins require stable modification either protein instead auxin promotes aux/iaa-scftir1 interaction binding directly scftir1 show loss tir1 three related f-box proteins eliminates saturable auxin binding plant extracts finally tir1 synthesized insect cells binds aux/iaa proteins auxin-dependent manner together results indicate tir1 auxin receptor mediates aux/iaa degradation auxin-regulated transcription
