haematopoietic stem cells require highly regulated protein synthesis rate 
many aspects cellular physiology remain unstudied somatic stem cells example almost data protein synthesis somatic stem cell set compare protein synthesis haematopoietic stem cells hscs restricted haematopoietic progenitors found amount protein synthesized per hour hscs vivo lower haematopoietic cells even controlled differences cell cycle status forced hscs undergo self-renewing divisions reduced ribosome function rpl24bst/+ mice reduced protein synthesis hscs impaired hsc function pten deletion increased protein synthesis hscs also reduced hsc function rpl24bst/+ cell-autonomously rescued effects pten deletion hscs blocking increase protein synthesis restoring hsc function delaying leukaemogenesis pten deficiency thus depletes hscs promotes leukaemia partly increasing protein synthesis either increased decreased protein synthesis impairs hsc function
