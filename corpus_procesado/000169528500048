contribution sensory experience maturation orientation selectivity ferret visual cortex
sensory experience begins neural circuits cerebral cortex still immature however contribution experience cortical maturation remains unclear visual cortex selectivity neurons oriented stimuli time eye opening poor- increases dramatically onset visual experience- investigate whether visual experience significant role maturation orientation selectivity underlying cortical circuits- using two forms deprivation: dark rearing completely eliminates experience binocular lid suture alters pattern sensory driven activity orientation maps present dark-reared ferrets fully mature levels tuning never attained contrast rudimentary levels orientation selectivity observed lid-sutured ferrets despite differences horizontal connections groups less extensive less clustered normal suggesting long-range cortical processing essential expression orientation selectivity may needed full maturation tuning thus experience beneficial highly detrimental cortical maturation depending pattern sensory driven activity
