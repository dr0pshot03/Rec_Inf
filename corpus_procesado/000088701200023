complete atomic structure large ribosomal subunit angstrom resolution
large ribosomal subunit catalyzes peptide bond formation binds initiation termination elongation factors determined crystal structure large ribosomal subunit haloarcula marismortui angstrom resolution includes subunits nucleotides proteins domains rnas irregular shapes fit together ribosome like pieces three-dimensional jigsaw puzzle form large monolithic structure proteins abundant everywhere surface except active site peptide bond formation occurs contacts small subunit proteins stabilize structure interacting several rna domains often using idiosyncratically folded extensions reach subunits interior
