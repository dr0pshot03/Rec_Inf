structure dynamics m3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor 
acetylcholine first neurotransmitter identified1 exerts many physiological actions via activation family g-protein-coupled receptors gpcrs known muscarinic acetylcholine receptors machrs although five machr subtypes m1-m5 share high degree sequence homology show pronounced differences g-protein coupling preference physiological responses mediate2- unfortunately despite decades effort therapeutic agents endowed clear machr subtype selectivity developed exploit differences56 describe structure gq/-coupled m3 machr m3 receptor rat bound bronchodilator drug tiotropium identify binding mode clinically important drug structure together gi/o-coupled m2 receptor7 offers possibilities design machr subtype-selective ligands importantly m3 receptor structure allows structural comparison two members mammalian gpcr subfamily displaying different g-protein coupling selectivities furthermore molecular dynamics simulations suggest tiotropium binds transiently allosteric site en route binding pocket receptors simulations offer structural view allosteric binding mode orthosteric gpcr ligand provide additional opportunities design ligands different affinities binding kinetics different machr subtypes findings offer insights structure function one important gpcr families may also facilitate design improved therapeutics targeting critical receptors
