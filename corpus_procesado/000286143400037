distributed biological computation multicellular engineered networks 
ongoing efforts within synthetic systems biology directed towards building artificial computational devices using engineered biological units basic building blocks efforts inspired standard design electronic circuits- limited difficulties arising wiring basic computational units logic gates appropriate connections one implemented different molecule show logically different form implementing complex boolean logic computations reduces wiring constraints thanks redundant distribution desired output among engineered cells practical implementation presented using library engineered yeast cells can combined multiple ways construct defines logic function combining cells connections allow building complex synthetic devices proof principle implemented many logic functions using just engineered cells note small modifications combination cells allowed implementing complex circuits multiplexer bit adder carry showing great potential re-utilization small parts circuit results support approach using cellular consortia efficient way engineering complex tasks easily solvable using single-cell implementations
