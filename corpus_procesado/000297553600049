specialized face learning associated individual recognition paper wasps 
demonstrate evolution facial recognition wasps associated specialized face-learning abilities polistes fuscatus can differentiate among normal wasp face images rapidly accurately nonface images manipulated faces close relative lacking facial recognition polistes metricus however lacks specialized face learning similar specializations face learning found primates mammals although p fuscatus represents independent evolution specialization convergence toward face specialization distant taxa well divergence among closely related taxa different recognition behavior suggests specialized cognition surprisingly labile may adaptively shaped species-specific selective pressures face recognition
