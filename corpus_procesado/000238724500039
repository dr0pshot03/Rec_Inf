local migration promotes competitive restraint host-pathogen tragedy commons
fragmented populations possess intriguing duplicity: even subpopulations reliably extinction-prone asynchrony local extinctions recolonizations makes global persistence possible- migration double-edged sword cases: little migration prevents recolonization extinct patches whereas much synchronizes subpopulations raising likelihood global extinction edges proverbial sword explored manipulating rate migration within experimental populations- however experiments examined evolutionary ecology fragmented populations depends pattern migration show migration pattern affects coexistence evolution within community bacterial hosts escherichia coli viral pathogens t4 coliphage distributed across large network subpopulations particular different patterns migration select distinct pathogen strategies term rapacious prudent strategies define tragedy commons: rapacious phage displace prudent variants shared host resources prudent phage productive alone find prudent phage dominate migration spatially restricted rapacious phage evolve unrestricted migration thus migration pattern alone can determine whether de novo tragedy commons resolved favour restraint
