engulfment genes cooperate ced promote cell death caenorhabditis elegans 
genetic studies identified dozen genes function programmed cell death apoptosis nematode caenorhabditis elegans- although ultimate effects cell survival engulfment mutations cell death gene extensively described much less known mutations affect kinetics death engulfment interactions two processes used four-dimensional-nomarski time-lapse video microscopy follow detail cell death genes regulate extent kinetics apoptotic cell death removal early c elegans embryo show blocking engulfment enhances cell survival cells subjected weak pro-apoptotic signals thus genes mediate corpse removal can also function actively kill cells
