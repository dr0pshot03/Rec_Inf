phosphofructokinase glycosylation regulates cell growth metabolism 
cancer cells must satisfy metabolic demands rapid cell growth within continually changing microenvironment demonstrated dynamic posttranslational modification proteins o-linked beta-n-acetylglucosamine o-glcnacylation key metabolic regulator glucose metabolism o-glcnacylation induced serine phosphofructokinase pfk1 response hypoxia glycosylation inhibited pfk1 activity redirected glucose flux pentose phosphate pathway thereby conferring selective growth advantage cancer cells blocking glycosylation pfk1 serine reduced cancer cell proliferation vitro impaired tumor formation vivo studies reveal previously uncharacterized mechanism regulation metabolic pathways cancer possible target therapeutic intervention
