gate-latch-lock mechanism hormone signalling abscisic acid receptors 
abscisic acid aba ubiquitous hormone regulates plant growth development responses environmental stresses action mediated pyr/pyl/rcar family start proteins remains unclear receptors bind aba turn hormone binding leads inhibition downstream type 2c protein phosphatase pp2c effectors report crystal structures apo aba-bound receptors well ternary pyl2-aba-pp2c complex apo receptors contain open ligand-binding pocket flanked gate closes response aba way conformational changes two highly conserved beta-loops serve gate latch moreover aba-induced closure gate creates surface enables receptor dock competitively inhibit pp2c active site conserved tryptophan pp2c inserts directly gate latch functions lock receptor closed conformation together results identify conserved gate-latch-lock mechanism underlying aba signalling
