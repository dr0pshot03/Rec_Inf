excitable gene regulatory circuit induces transient cellular differentiation
certain types cellular differentiation probabilistic transient- systems individual cells can switch alternative state time switch back bacillus subtilis competence example transiently differentiated state associated capability dna uptake environment individual genes proteins underlying differentiation competent state identified unclear genes interact dynamically individual cells control spontaneous entry competence return vegetative growth show behaviour can understood terms excitability underlying genetic circuit using quantitative fluorescence time-lapse microscopy directly observed activities multiple circuit components simultaneously individual cells analysed resulting data terms mathematical model find excitable core module containing positive negative feedback loops can explain entry exit competent state tested model analysing initiation sister cells re-engineering gene circuit specifically block exit excitable dynamics driven noise naturally generate stochastic transient responses thereby providing ideal mechanism competence regulation
