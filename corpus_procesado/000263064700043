chlamydia causes fragmentation golgi compartment ensure reproduction
obligate intracellular bacterium chlamydia trachomatis survives replicates within membrane bound vacuole termed inclusion intercepts host exocytic pathways obtain nutrients- like many intracellular pathogens c trachomatis marked requirement host cell lipids sphingolipids cholesterol produced endoplasmic reticulum golgi apparatus- however mechanisms intracellular pathogens acquire host cell lipids well understood- particular host cell protein responsible transporting golgi-derived lipids chlamydial inclusions yet identified show chlamydia infection human epithelial cells induces golgi fragmentation generate golgi ministacks surrounding bacterial inclusion ministack formation triggered proteolytic cleavage golgimatrix protein golgin- inhibition golgin truncation prevents golgi fragmentation causing block lipid acquisition maturation c trachomatis golgi fragmentation means rna interference mediated knockdown distinct golgi matrix proteins infection enhances bacterial maturation data functionally connect bacteria induced golgin cleavage golgi ministack formation lipid acquisition intracellular pathogen growth show c trachomatis subverts structure function entire host cell organelle advantage
