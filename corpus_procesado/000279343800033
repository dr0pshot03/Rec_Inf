polar ocean glacial cycles atmospheric co2 concentration 
global climate atmospheric partial pressure carbon dioxide pco2atm correlated recent glacial cycles lower pco2atm ice ages causes pco2atm changes unknown modern southern ocean releases deeply sequestered co2 atmosphere growing evidence suggests southern ocean co2 leak stemmed ice ages increasing ocean co2 storage change also made global ocean alkaline driving additional ocean co2 uptake explanation lower ice-age pco2atm correct much teach us controls current ocean processes
