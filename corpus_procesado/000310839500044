germ cell migration across sertoli cell tight junctions 
blood-testis barrier includes strands tight junctions somatic sertoli cells restricts solutes crossing paracellular space creating microenvironment within seminiferous tubules providing immune privilege meiotic postmeiotic cells large cysts germ cells transit sertoli cell tight junctions sctjs without compromising integrity used confocal microscopy visualize sctj components germ cell cyst migration across sctjs cysts become enclosed within network transient compartments fully bounded old new tight junctions dissolution old tight junctions releases germ cells adluminal compartment thus completing transit across blood-testis barrier claudin tight junction protein transiently incorporated new tight junctions replaced claudin
