regulation elongating rna polymerase ii forkhead transcription factors yeast 
elongation phase transcription rna polymerase ii rnapii highly regulated tightly linked pre-messenger rna pre-mrna processing recent studies implicated early elongation checkpoint facilitates link pre-mrna processing show yeast forkhead transcription factors fkh1p fkh2p associate coding regions active genes influence opposing ways transcriptional elongation termination events coordinated serine phosphorylation heptad repeat carboxy-terminal domain ctd rnapii results suggest addition documented promoter function fkh1p fkh2p coordinate early transcription elongation pre-mrna processing may reflect general feature gene regulation eukaryotes
