marine taxa track local climate velocities 
organisms expected adapt move response climate change observed distribution shifts span wide range directions rates explanations often emphasize biological distinctions among species general mechanisms elusive tested alternative hypothesis: differences climate velocity-the rate direction climate shifts across landscape-can explain observed species shifts compiled database coastal surveys around north america sampling million individuals across marine taxa climate velocity explained magnitude direction shifts latitude depth much effectively species characteristics results demonstrate marine species shift different rates directions closely track complex mosaic local climate velocities
