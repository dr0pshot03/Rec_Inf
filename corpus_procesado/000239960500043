signal sequence directs localized secretion bacterial surface proteins 
living cells require specific mechanisms target proteins cell surface eukaryotes first part process involves recognition endoplasmic reticulum amino-terminal signal sequences translocation sec translocons whereas subsequent targeting different surface locations promoted internal sorting signals bacteria n-terminal signal sequences promote translocation across cytoplasmic membrane surrounds entire cell proteins nevertheless secreted one part cell poorly understood mechanisms analyse localized secretion gram-positive pathogen streptococcus pyogenes show signal sequences two surface proteins m protein protein f prtf direct secretion different subcellular regions signal sequence m protein promotes secretion division septum whereas prtf preferentially promotes secretion old pole work therefore shows signal sequence may contain information directs secretion protein one subcellular region addition classical role promoting secretion finding identifies new level complexity protein translocation emphasizes potential bacterial systems analysis fundamental cell-biological problems
