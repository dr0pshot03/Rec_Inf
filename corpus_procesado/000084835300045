reduced estimate number kilometre-sized near-earth asteroids 
near-earth asteroids small diameters < km rocky bodies orbits approach earth come within au sun chance approximately % colliding earth next million years total number bodies diameters > km estimated range - translates approximately % chance catastrophic collision earth next millennium numbers however poorly constrained limitations previous searches using photographic plates one kilometre size body whose impact earth produce global effects report analysis survey near-earth asteroids uses improved detection technologies find total number asteroids diameters > km half earlier estimates current rate discovery near-earth asteroids % will probably detected within next years
