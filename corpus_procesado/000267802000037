cell growth size homeostasis proliferating animal cells 
long-standing question biology whether intrinsic mechanism coordinating growth cell cycle metazoan cells examined cell size distributions populations lymphoblasts applied mathematical analysis calculate growth rates vary cell size cell cycle results show growth rate size-dependent throughout cell cycle initial growth suppression rapid increase growth rate g1 phase followed period constant exponential growth probability cell division varies independently cell size cell age conclude proliferating mammalian cells intrinsic mechanism maintains cell size
