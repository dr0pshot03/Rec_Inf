piggybac transposition reprograms fibroblasts induced pluripotent stem cells
transgenic expression just four defined transcription factors c-myc klf4 oct4 sox2 sufficient reprogram somatic cells pluripotent state- resulting induced pluripotent stem ips cells resemble embryonic stem cells properties potential differentiate spectrum adult cell types current reprogramming strategies involve retroviral lentiviral adenoviral plasmid transfection deliver reprogramming factor transgenes although latter two methods transient minimize potential insertion mutagenesis currently limited diminished reprogramming efficiencies piggybac pb transposition host-factor independent recently demonstrated functional various human mouse cell lines- pb transposon/transposase system requires inverted terminal repeats flanking transgene transient expression transposase enzyme catalyse insertion excision events demonstrate successful efficient reprogramming murine human embryonic fibroblasts using doxycycline-inducible transcription factors delivered pb transposition stable ips cells thus generated express characteristic pluripotency markers succeed series rigorous differentiation assays taking advantage natural propensity pb system seamless excision show individual pb insertions can removed established ips cell lines providing invaluable tool discovery addition demonstrated traceless removal reprogramming factors joined viral 2a sequences delivered single transposon murine ips lines anticipate unique properties virus-independent simplification ips cell production will accelerate field towards full exploration reprogramming process future cell-based therapies
