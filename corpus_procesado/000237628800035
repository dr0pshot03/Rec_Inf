drilling gabbro intact ocean crust
sampling intact sequence oceanic crust lavas dikes gabbros necessary advance understanding formation evolution crust formed mid-ocean ridges elusive goal scientific ocean drilling decades recent drilling eastern pacific ocean hole 1256d reached gabbro within seismic layer meters crust formed superfast spreading rate gabbros crystallized melt lenses formed beneath mid-ocean ridge depth gabbro reached confirms predictions extrapolated seismic experiments modern mid-ocean ridges: melt lenses occur shallower depths faster spreading rates gabbros intrude metamorphosed sheeted dikes compositions similar overlying lavas precluding formation cumulate lower oceanic crust melt lenses far penetrated hole 1256d
