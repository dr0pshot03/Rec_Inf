new boson mass gev observed cms experiment large hadron collider 
higgs boson postulated nearly five decades ago within framework standard model particle physics subject numerous searches accelerators around world discovery verify existence complex scalar field thought give mass three carriers electroweak force-the w+ w- z0 bosons-as well fundamental quarks leptons cms collaboration observed statistical significance five standard deviations new particle produced proton-proton collisions large hadron collider cern evidence strongest diphoton four-lepton electrons and/or muons final states provide best mass resolution cms detector probability observed signal due random fluctuation background x new particle boson spin equal mass giga-electron volts although measured properties within uncertainties present data consistent expected higgs boson data needed elucidate precise nature new particle
