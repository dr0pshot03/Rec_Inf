vernier templating synthesis porphyrin nano-ring 
templates widely used arrange molecular components can covalently linked complex molecules readily accessible classical synthetic methods- nature uses sophisticated templates ribosome whereas chemists use simple ions small molecules tackle synthesis larger targets require larger templates-which become synthetically challenging show vernier complexes can solve problem: number binding sites template nt multiple number binding sites molecular building blocks nb small templates can direct assembly relatively large vernier complexes number binding sites product np lowest common multiple nb nt refs illustrate value concept covalent synthesis challenging targets using simple six-site template direct synthesis porphyrin nano-ring diameter nm thus establishing vernier templating powerful new strategy synthesis large monodisperse macromolecules
