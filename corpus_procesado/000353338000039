sarm1 activation triggers axon degeneration locally via nad+ destruction
axon degeneration intrinsic self-destruction program underlies axon loss injury disease sterile alpha tir motif-containing sarm1 protein essential mediator axon degeneration report sarm1 initiates local destruction program involving rapid breakdown nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide nad+ injury used engineered protease-sensitized sarm1 demonstrate sarm1 activity required axon injury induce axon degeneration dimerization toll-interleukin receptor tir domain sarm1 alone sufficient induce locally mediated axon degeneration formation sarm1 tir dimer triggered rapid breakdown nad+ whereas sarm1-induced axon destruction counteracted increased nad+ synthesis sarm1-induced depletion nad+ may explain potent axon protection wallerian degeneration slow wlds mutant mice
