generation nuclear transfer-derived pluripotent es cells cloned cdx2-deficient blastocysts 
derivation embryonic stem es cells nuclear transfer holds great promise research therapy involves destruction cloned human blastocysts proof principle experiments shown customized es cells derived nuclear transfer nt-escs can used correct immunodeficiency mice importantly feasibility approach demonstrated recently humans bringing clinical application nt escs within reach altered nuclear transfer ant proposed variation nuclear transfer create abnormal nuclear transfer blastocysts inherently unable implant uterus capable generating customized es cells assess experimental validity concept used nuclear transfer derive mouse blastocysts donor fibroblasts carried short hairpin rna construct targeting cdx2 cloned blastocysts morphologically abnormal lacked functional trophoblast failed implant uterus however efficiently generated pluripotent embryonic stem cells explanted culture
