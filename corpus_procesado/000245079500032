total synthesis marine natural products without using protecting groups 
field organic synthesis made phenomenal advances past fifty years yet chemists still struggle design synthetic routes will enable obtain sufficient quantities complex molecules biological medical studies total synthesis therefore increasingly focused preparing natural products efficient manner possible describe preparative-scale enantioselective total syntheses members hapalindole fischerindole welwitindolinone ambiguine families constructed without need protecting groups use groups adds considerably cost complexity syntheses consequence molecules previously required twenty steps synthesize racemically milligram amounts can now obtained single enantiomers significant quantities ten steps less extension general principles demonstrated possible access complex molecular architectures without using protecting groups
