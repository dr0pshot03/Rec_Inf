sequential checkpoints govern substrate selection cotranslational protein targeting 
proper protein localization essential cells however precise mechanism high fidelity achieved well understood protein-targeting pathway address fundamental question investigated signal recognition particle srp pathway escherichia coli delivers proteins bacterial inner membrane recognition signal sequences cargo proteins fidelity thought arise inability srp bind strongly incorrect cargos using biophysical assays found incorrect cargos also rejected series checkpoints subsequent steps targeting thus high fidelity substrate selection achieved cumulative effect multiple checkpoints principle may generally applicable pathways involving selective signal recognition
