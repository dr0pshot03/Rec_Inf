graphite polyhedral crystals 
polyhedral nano microstructures shapes faceted needles rods rings barrels double-tipped pyramids call graphite polyhedral crystals gpcs discovered found pores glassy carbon nanotube cores graphite faces can exhibit unusual sevenfold ninefold complex axial symmetry although giant radially extended nanotubes raman spectroscopy transmission electron microscopy suggest gpcs degree perfection higher multiwall nanotubes similar size crystals micrometer cross section micrometers length can probably grown much larger sires preliminary results suggest high electrical conductivity strength chemical stability gpc
