scaling embryonic patterning based phase-gradient encoding 
fundamental feature embryonic patterning ability scale maintain stable proportions despite changes overall size instance growth1- notable example occurs vertebrate segment formation: experimental reduction embryo size segments form proportionally smaller consequently normal number segments formed178 despite decades experimental17 theoretical work9- underlying mechanism remains unknown recently ultradian oscillations gene activity linked temporal control segmentation12; however implication scaling remains elusive show scaling gene oscillation dynamics underlies segment scaling end develop new experimental model ex vivo primary cell culture assay recapitulates mouse mesoderm patterning segment scaling quasi-monolayer presomitic mesoderm cells hereafter termed monolayer psm mpsm combined real-time imaging gene activity enabled us quantify gradual shift oscillation phase thus determine resulting phase gradient across mpsm crucially show phase gradient scales maintaining fixed amplitude across mpsm different lengths identify slope phase gradient single predictive parameter segment size functions size-and temperature-independent manner revealing hitherto unrecognized mechanism scaling notably contrast molecular gradients phase gradient describes distribution dynamical cellular state thus phase-gradient scaling findings reveal new level dynamic information-processing provide evidence concept phase-gradient encoding embryonic patterning scaling
