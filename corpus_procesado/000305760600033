dimensionality consumer search space drives trophic interaction strengths
trophic interactions govern biomass fluxes ecosystems stability food webs knowledge trophic interaction strengths affected differences among habitats crucial understanding variation ecological systems show substantial variation consumption-rate data hence trophic interaction strengths arises consumers tend encounter resources frequently three dimensions 3d example arboreal pelagic zones two dimensions 2d example terrestrial benthic zones combining new theory extensive data species body masses ranging x - kg kg find consumption rates scale sublinearly consumer body mass exponent approximately 2d interactions superlinearly exponent approximately 3d interactions results contradict currently widespread assumption single exponent approximately consumer-resource food-web research analysis consumer-resource interactions shows dimensionality consumer search space probably major driver species coexistence stability abundance populations
