mandibular remains support taxonomic validity australopithecus sediba
since announcement species australopithecus sediba questions raised whether malapa fossils represent valid taxon whether inadequate allowance made intraspecific variation particular reference temporally geographically proximate species au africanus morphology mandibular remains au sediba including newly recovered material discussed shows merely late-surviving morph au africanus rather-as seen elsewhere cranium dentition postcranial skeleton-these mandibular remains share similarities australopiths can differentiated hypodigm au africanus size shape well ontogenetic growth trajectory
