animal cryptochromes mediate magnetoreception unconventional photochemical mechanism
understanding biophysical basis animal magnetoreception one greatest challenges sensory biology recently discovered light-dependent magnetic sense drosophila melanogaster mediated ultraviolet uv-a/blue light photoreceptor cryptochrome cry show using transgenic approach photoreceptive drosophila-like type cry transcriptionally repressive vertebrate-like type cry monarch butterfly danaus plexippus can function magnetoreception system drosophila require uv-a/blue light wavelength nm lack magnetic responses cry types wavelengths nm fit widely held view tryptophan triad-generated radical pairs mediate ability cry sense magnetic field bolster assessment using mutant form drosophila monarch type cry confirm tryptophan triad pathway crucial magnetic transduction together results suggest animal crys mediate light-dependent magnetoreception unconventional photochemical mechanism work emphasizes utility drosophila transgenesis elucidating precise mechanisms cry-mediated magnetosensitivity insects also vertebrates migrating birds
