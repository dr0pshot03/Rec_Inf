triggering earthquake aftershocks dynamic stresses 
thought small static stress changes due permanent fault displacement can alter likelihood trigger earthquakes nearby faults many studies triggering nearfield particularly aftershocks rely static changes triggering agent- consider terms equivalent changes applied load fault- report comparison aftershock pattern moment magnitude m-w landers earthquake static stress changes also transient oscillatory stress changes transmitted seismic waves dynamic stresses dynamic stresses permanently change applied load thus can trigger earthquakes altering mechanical state properties fault zone dynamically weakened faults may fail seismic waves passed might even cause earthquakes otherwise occurred rnd similar asymmetries aftershock dynamic stress patterns latter due rupture propagation whereas static stress changes lack asymmetry previous studies shown dynamic stresses can promote failure remote distances- show can also nearby
