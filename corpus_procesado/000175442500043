genomewide analysis mrna processing yeast using splicing-specific microarrays 
introns interrupt almost every eukaryotic protein-coding gene yet splicing apparatus interprets genome messenger rna mrna synthesis poorly understood designed microarrays distinguish spliced unspliced rna intron-containing yeast gene measured genomewide effects splicing caused loss different mrna processing factors accommodating changes transcription decay using gene-specific indexes functional relationships mrna processing factors can identified common effects spliced unspliced rna groups genes different dependencies mrna processing factors also apparent quantitative polymerase chain reactions confirm array-based finding prp17p prp18p dispensable removal introns short branchpoint-to- splice site distances
