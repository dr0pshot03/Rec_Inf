app binds dr6 trigger axon pruning neuron death via distinct caspases 
naturally occurring axonal pruning neuronal cell death help sculpt neuronal connections development mechanistic basis remains poorly understood report beta-amyloid precursor protein app death receptor dr6 also known tnfrsf21 activate widespread caspase dependent self destruction program dr6 broadly expressed developing neurons required normal cell body death axonal pruning vivo trophic factor deprivation vitro unlike neuronal cell body apoptosis requires caspase show axonal degeneration requires caspase activated punctate pattern parallels pattern axonal fragmentation dr6 activated locally inactive surface ligand s released active form trophic factor deprivation identify app dr6 ligand trophic factor deprivation triggers shedding surface app beta-secretase bace dependent manner loss gain function studies support model cleaved amino terminal fragment app n app binds dr6 triggers degeneration genetic support provided common neuromuscular junction phenotype mutant mice results indicate app dr6 components neuronal self destruction pathway suggest extracellular fragment app acting via dr6 caspase contributes alzheimers disease
