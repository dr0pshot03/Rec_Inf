independent parallel recruitment preexisting mechanisms underlying c photosynthesis
c photosynthesis allows increased photosynthetic efficiency carbon dioxide co2 concentrated around key enzyme rubisco leaves c plants exhibit modified biochemistry cell biology leaf development despite complexity c photosynthesis evolved independently least lineages plants found two independent lineages c plant whose last common ancestor predates divergence monocotyledons dicotyledons million years ago show conserved mechanisms controlling expression genes important release co2 around rubisco bundle sheath bs cells orthologous genes monocotyledonous dicotyledonous c species also contained conserved regulatory elements conferred bs specificity placed c species conclude conserved functional genetic elements likely facilitated repeated evolution c photosynthesis
