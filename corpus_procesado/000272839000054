fanconi anemia pathway promotes replication-dependent dna interstrand cross-link repair
fanconi anemia human cancer predisposition syndrome caused mutations fanc genes disorder characterized genomic instability cellular hypersensitivity chemicals generate dna interstrand cross-links icls central event activation fanconi anemia pathway mono-ubiquitylation fanci-fancd2 complex complex confers icl resistance remains enigmatic using cell-free system showed fanci-fancd2 required replication-coupled icl repair s phase removal fancd2 extracts inhibits nucleolytic incisions near icl translesion dna synthesis past lesion reversal defects requires ubiquitylated fanci-fancd2 results show multiple steps essential s-phase icl repair mechanism fail fanconi anemia pathway compromised
