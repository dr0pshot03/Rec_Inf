multiple volcanic episodes flood basalts caused thermochemical mantle plumes
hypothesis single mushroom-like mantle plume head can generate large igneous province within million years widely accepted siberian traps permian triassic boundary deccan traps cretaceous tertiary boundary probably erupted within one million years large eruptions linked mass extinctions recent geochronological data- reveal one pulse major eruptions diverse magma flux within several flood basalts extending tens million years observation indicates processes leading large igneous provinces complicated purely thermal single-stage plume model suggests present numerical experiments demonstrate entrainment dense eclogite-derived material base mantle thermal plumes can develop secondary instabilities due interaction thermal compositional buoyancy forces characteristic timescales development secondary instabilities variation plume strength compatible observations process may contribute multiple episodes large igneous provinces
