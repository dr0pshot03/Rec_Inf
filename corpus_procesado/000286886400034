actively accreting massive black hole dwarf starburst galaxy henize
supermassive black holes now thought lie heart every giant galaxy spheroidal component including milky way birth growth first seed black holes earlier universe however observationally unconstrained beginning piece together scenario subsequent evolution report nearby dwarf starburst galaxy henize refs contains compact radio source dynamical centre galaxy spatially coincident hard x-ray source observations conclude henize harbours actively accreting central black hole mass approximately one million solar masses nearby dwarf galaxy simultaneously hosting massive black hole extreme burst star formation analogous many ways galaxies infant universe early stages black-hole growth galaxy mass assembly results confirm nearby star-forming dwarf galaxies can indeed form massive black holes implication can primordial counterparts moreover lack substantial spheroidal component henize indicates supermassive black-hole growth may precede build-up galaxy spheroids
