model breast cancer heterogeneity reveals vascular mimicry driver metastasis 
cancer metastasis requires primary tumour cells evolve capacity intravasate lymphatic system vasculature extravasate colonize secondary sites1 others demonstrated individual cells within complex populations show heterogeneity capacity form secondary lesions2- develop polyclonal mouse model breast tumour heterogeneity show distinct clones within mixed population display specialization example dominating primary tumour contributing metastatic populations showing tropism entering lymphatic vasculature systems correlate stable properties distinct gene expression profiles clones efficiently enter vasculature express two secreted proteins serpine2 slpi necessary sufficient program cells vascular mimicry data indicate proteins drive formation extravascular networks also ensure perfusion acting anticoagulants propose vascular mimicry drives ability breast tumour cells contribute distant metastases simultaneously satisfying critical need primary tumour fed vasculature enforced expression serpine2 slpi human breast cancer cell lines also programmed vascular mimicry serpine2 slpi overexpressed preferentially human patients lung-metastatic relapse thus two secreted proteins phenotype promote may broadly relevant drivers metastatic progression human cancer
