clonal analysis reveals common progenitor thymic cortical medullary epithelium
thymus provides essential environment development t cells haemopoietic progenitors environment separated cortical medullary regions containing functionally distinct epithelial populations important successive stages t-cell development selection however developmental origin lineage relationships cortical medullary epithelial cell types remain controversial describe clonal assay investigate developmental potential single individually selected thymic epithelial progenitors marked enhanced yellow fluorescent protein developing within normal architecture thymus using approach show cortical medullary epithelial cells share common origin bipotent precursors providing definitive evidence single rather dual germ layer origin embryogenesis findings resolve long-standing issue thymus development important relation development cell-based strategies thymus disorders possibility restoring function atrophied adult thymus
