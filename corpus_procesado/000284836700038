redox state arc mantle using zn/fe systematics
many arc lavas oxidized mid-ocean-ridge basalts subduction introduces oxidized components mantle- consequence sub-arc mantle wedge widely believed oxidized fe oxidation state sub-arc mantle however difficult determine directly debate persists whether oxidation intrinsic mantle source show zn/fet fet fe+ + fe+ redox-sensitive retains memory valence state fe primary arc basalts mantle sources melting mantle peridotite fe+ zn behave similarly fe+ incompatible fe+ melts generated oxidized environments low zn/fet primitive arc magmas identical zn/fet mid-ocean-ridge basalts suggesting primary mantle melts arcs ridges similar fe oxidation states constancy zn/fet early differentiation involving olivine requires fe+/fet remains low magma progressive fractionation fe+/fet increase stabilize magnetite fractionating phase results suggest subduction oxidized crustal material may significantly alter redox state mantle wedge thus higher oxidation states arc lavas must part consequence shallow-level differentiation processes though processes remain poorly understood
