agrochemical control plant water use using engineered abscisic acid receptors 
rising temperatures lessening fresh water supplies threatening agricultural productivity motivated efforts improve plant water use drought tolerance water deficit plants produce elevated levels abscisic acid aba improves water consumption stress tolerance controlling guard cell aperture protective responses12 one attractive strategy controlling water use develop compounds activate aba receptors agonists approved use yet developed principle engineered aba receptor can activated existing agrochemical achieve goal describe variant aba receptor pyrabactin resistance pyr1 possesses nanomolar sensitivity agrochemical mandipropamid demonstrate efficacy controlling aba responses drought tolerance transgenic plants furthermore crystallographic studies provide mechanistic basis activity demonstrate relative ease pyr1 ligand-binding pocket can altered accommodate new ligands thus successfully repurposed agrochemical new application using receptor engineering anticipate strategy will applied plant receptors represents new avenue crop improvement
