temporal precision neural code timescales natural vision 
timing action potentials relative sensory stimuli can precise milliseconds visual system- even though relevant timescales natural vision much slower existence precision contributes fundamental debate basis neural code specifically timescales important neural computation- using recordings lateral geniculate nucleus demonstrate relevant timescale neuronal spike trains depends frequency content visual stimulus relative absolute precision maintained spatially uniform white-noise visual stimuli naturalistic movies using information-theoretic techniques demonstrate clear role relative precision show experimentally observed temporal structure neuronal response necessary represent accurately slowly changing visual world establishing functional role precision link visual neuron function slow timescales temporal structure response faster timescales uncover straightforward purpose fine-timescale features neuronal spike trains
