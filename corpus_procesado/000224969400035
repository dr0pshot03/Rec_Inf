symmetry breaking evolution development
simplicity binary-switch nature left-right asymmetry permits meaningful comparisons among many different organisms phylogenetic analyses asymmetry variation inheritance molecular mechanisms reveal unexpected insights development evolves first directional asymmetry evolutionary novelty arose nonheritabie origins almost often mutations implying genetic assimilation phenotype precedes genotype common mode evolution second molecular pathway directing hearts leftward-the nodal cascade-varies considerably among vertebrates homology form require homology development possibly co-opted preexisting asymmetrical chordate organ system finally declining frequencies spontaneous asymmetry reversal throughout vertebrate evolution suggest heart development become canalized
