mutation spectrum revealed paired genome sequences lung cancer patient 
lung cancer leading cause cancer-related mortality worldwide non-small-cell lung carcinomas smokers predominant form disease although previous studies identified important common somatic mutations lung cancers primarily focused limited set genes thus provided constrained view mutational spectrum- recent cancer sequencing efforts used next-generation sequencing technologies provide genome-wide view mutations leukaemia breast cancer cancer cell lines- present complete sequences primary lung tumour coverage adjacent normal tissue comparing two genomes identify wide variety somatic variations including > high-confidence single nucleotide variants validated somatic single nucleotide variants tumour including one kras proto-oncogene others coding regions well large-scale structural variations constitute large set new somatic mutations yield estimated per megabase genome-wide somatic mutation rate notably observe distinct pattern selection mutations within expressed genes compared non-expressed genes promoter regions kilobases upstream protein-coding genes furthermore observe higher rate amino acid-changing mutations kinase genes present comprehensive view somatic alterations single lung tumour provide first evidence knowledge distinct selective pressures present within tumour environment
