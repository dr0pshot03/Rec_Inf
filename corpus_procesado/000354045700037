human transcriptome across tissues individuals 
transcriptional regulation posttranscriptional processing underlie many cellular organismal phenotypes used rna sequence data generated genotype-tissue expression gtex project investigate patterns transcriptome variation across individuals tissues tissues exhibit characteristic transcriptional signatures show stability postmortem samples signatures dominated relatively small number genes-which clearly seen blood-though exclusive particular tissue vary across tissues individuals genes exhibiting high interindividual expression variation include disease candidates associated sex ethnicity age primary transcription major driver cellular specificity splicing playing mostly complementary role; except brain exhibits divergent splicing program variation splicing despite stochasticity may play contrast comparatively greater role defining individual phenotypes
