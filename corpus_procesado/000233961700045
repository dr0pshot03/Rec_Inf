neural systems responding degrees uncertainty human decision-making
much known people make decisions varying levels probability risk less known neural basis decision-making probabilities uncertain missing information ambiguity decision theory ambiguity probabilities affect choices using functional brain imaging show level ambiguity choices correlates positively activation amygdala orbitofrontal cortex negatively striatal system moreover striatal activity correlates positively expected reward neurological subjects orbitofrontal lesions insensitive level ambiguity risk behavioral choices data suggest general neural circuit responding degrees uncertainty contrary decision theory
