changes wind pattern alter albatross distribution life-history traits
westerly winds southern ocean increased intensity moved poleward using long-term demographic foraging records show foraging range wandering albatrosses shifted poleward conjunction changes wind pattern rates travel flight speeds increased consequently duration foraging trips decreased breeding success improved birds increased mass kilogram positive consequences climate change may temporary patterns wind southern westerlies follow predicted climate change scenarios study stresses importance foraging performance key link environmental changes population processes
