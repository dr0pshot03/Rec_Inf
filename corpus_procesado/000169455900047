spike transmission synchrony detection networks gabaergic interneurons 
temporal pattern relative timing action potentials among neocortical neurons may carry important information however cortical circuits detect generate coherent activity remains unclear using paired recordings rat neocortical slices found firing fast-spiking cells can reflect spiking pattern single-axon pyramidal inputs moreover property allowed groups fast-spiking cells interconnected electrical gamma aminobutyric acid gaba-releasing gabaergic synapses detect relative timing excitatory inputs results indicate networks fast-spiking cells may play role detection promotion synchronous activity within neocortex
