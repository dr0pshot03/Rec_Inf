imaging precessional motion magnetization vector
report imaging three-dimensional precessional orbits magnetization vector magnetic field means time-resolved vectorial kerr experiment measures three components magnetization vector picosecond resolution images precessional mode taken submicrometer spatial resolution reveal dynamical excitation time regime roughly mirrors symmetry underlying equilibrium spin configuration propagation non-wavelike character results form basis realistic models magnetization dynamics largely unexplored technologically increasingly relevant time scale
