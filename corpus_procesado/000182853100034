bmi determines proliferative capacity normal leukaemic stem cells 
emerging concept field cancer biology rare population tumour stem cells exists among heterogeneous group cells constitute tumour concept best described human leukaemia indicates stem cell function whether normal neoplastic might defined common set critical genes show polycomb group gene bmi key role regulating proliferative activity normal stem progenitor cells importantly provide evidence proliferative potential leukaemic stem progenitor cells lacking bmi compromised eventually undergo proliferation arrest show signs differentiation apoptosis leading transplant failure leukaemia complementation studies showed bmi completely rescues proliferative defects studies therefore indicate bmi essential role regulating proliferative activity normal leukaemic stem cells
