multispecies diel transcriptional oscillations open ocean heterotrophic bacterial assemblages 
oscillating diurnal rhythms gene transcription metabolic activity behavior found three domains life however diel cycles naturally occurring heterotrophic bacteria archaea rarely observed report time-resolved whole-genome transcriptome profiles multiple naturally occurring oceanic bacterial populations sampled situ days anticipated cyanobacterial transcriptome exhibited pronounced diel periodicity unexpectedly several different heterotrophic bacterioplankton groups also displayed diel cycling many gene transcripts furthermore diel oscillations different heterotrophic bacterial groups suggested population-specific timing peak transcript expression variety metabolic gene suites staggered multispecies waves diel gene transcription may influence tempo mode matter energy transformation sea
