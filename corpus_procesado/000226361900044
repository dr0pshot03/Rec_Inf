anticonvulsant medications extend worm life-span
genetic studies elucidated mechanisms regulate aging little progress identifying drugs delay aging report ethosuximide trimethadione -diethyl--pyrrolidinone increase mean maximum life-span caenorhabditis elegans delay age-related declines physiological processes indicating compounds retard aging process compounds two approved human use anticonvulsants modulate neural activity compounds also regulated neuromuscular activity nematodes findings suggest life-span-extending activity compounds related anticonvulsant activity implicate neural activity regulation aging
