cyclin regulates kinetochore microtubules promote faithful chromosome segregation 
conspicuous event cell cycle alignment chromosomes metaphase chromosome alignment fosters faithful segregation formation bi-oriented attachments kinetochores spindle microtubules notably numerous kinetochore-microtubule k-mt attachment errors present early mitosis prometaphase persistence errors leading cause chromosome mis-segregation aneuploid human tumour cells continually mis-segregate whole chromosomes display chromosomal instability2- robust error correction achieved prometaphase ensure error-free mitosis remains unknown show k-mt attachments prometaphase cells considerably less stable metaphase cells switch stable k-mt attachments metaphase requires proteasome-dependent destruction cyclin prometaphase persistent cyclin expression prevents k-mt stabilization even cells aligned chromosomes contrast k-mts prematurely stabilized cyclin-a-deficient cells consequently cells lacking cyclin display higher rates chromosome mis-segregation thus stability k-mt attachments increases decisively coordinated fashion among chromosomes cells transit prometaphase metaphase cyclin creates cellular environment promotes microtubule detachment kinetochores prometaphase ensure efficient error correction faithful chromosome segregation
