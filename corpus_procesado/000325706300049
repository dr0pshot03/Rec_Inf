coherent raman spectro-imaging laser frequency combs 
advances optical spectroscopy microscopy profound impact throughout physical chemical biological sciences one example coherent raman spectroscopy versatile technique interrogating vibrational transitions molecules offers high spatial resolution three-dimensional sectioning capabilities make label-free tool12 non-destructive chemically selective probing complex systems indeed single-colour raman bands imaged biological tissue video rates34 using ultra-short-pulse lasers however identifying multiple possibly unknown molecules requires broad spectral bandwidth high resolution moderate spectral spans combined high-speed acquisition now within reach using multichannel detection5 frequency-swept laser beams6- laser frequency combs10 finding increasing use broadband molecular linear absorption spectroscopy11- show exploring potential nonlinear spectroscopy16 can harnessed coherent anti-stokes raman spectroscopy spectro-imaging method uses two combs can simultaneously measure microsecond timescale spectral elements wide bandwidth high resolution single photodetector although overall measurement time proof-of-principle experiments limited waiting times successive spectral acquisitions limitation can overcome system development therefore expect approach using laser frequency combs will enable new applications nonlinear microscopy also benefit nonlinear spectroscopic techniques
