functional innervation hepatic inkt cells immunosuppressive following stroke 
systemic immunosuppression associated stroke many years underlying mechanisms poorly understood study demonstrated stroke induced profound behavioral changes hepatic invariant nkt inkt cells mice unexpectedly effects mediated noradrenergic neurotransmitter rather cd1d ligand well-characterized danger signals blockade innervation protective wild-type mice stroke effect mice deficient inkt cells selective immunomodulation inkt cells specific activator a-galactosylceramide promoted proinflammatory cytokine production prevented infections stroke results therefore identify molecular mechanism leads immunosuppression stroke suggest attractive potential therapeutic alternative antibiotics namely immunomodulation inkt cells prevent stroke-associated infections
