genome-wide analysis human kinases clathrin caveolae/raft-mediated endocytosis 
endocytosis key cellular process encompassing different entry routes endocytic compartments extent endocytosis subjected high-order regulation cellular signalling machinery remains unclear using high-throughput rna interference automated image analysis explored function human kinases two principal types endocytosis: clathrin caveolae/raft-mediated endocytosis monitored infection vesicular stomatitis virus simian virus transferrin trafficking also cell proliferation apoptosis assays show high number kinases involved endocytosis endocytic route regulated specific kinase subset notably one group kinases exerted opposite effects two endocytic routes suggesting coordinate regulation analysis demonstrates signalling functions controlling cell adhesion growth proliferation built machinery endocytosis much higher degree previously recognized
