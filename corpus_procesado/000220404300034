retrograde spins near-earth asteroids yarkovsky effect
dynamical resonances asteroid belt gateway production near-earth asteroids neas generate observed number neas however requires injection many asteroids resonant regions collisional processes long claimed possible source- difficulties idea led suggestion orbital drift arising yarkovsky effect- dominates injection process- yarkovsky effect force arising differential heating afternoon side asteroid warmer morning side two models predict different rotational properties neas: usual collisional theories consistent nearly isotropic distribution rotation vectors whereas yarkovsky model predicts excess retrograde rotations report spin vectors neas show strong statistically significant excess retrograde rotations quantitatively consistent theoretical expectations yarkovsky model
