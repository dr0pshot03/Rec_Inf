ssb protein diffusion single-stranded dna stimulates reca filament formation 
single-stranded dna generated cell dna metabolism stabilized protected binding ssdna-binding ssb proteins escherichia coli ssb representative homotetrameric ssb binds ssdna wrapping dna using four subunits however tightly wrapped high-affinity protein-dna complex still needs removed repositioned quickly unhindered action proteins show using single-molecule two three-colour fluorescence resonance energy transfer tetrameric ssb can spontaneously migrate along ssdna diffusional migration ssb helps local displacement ssb elongating reca filament ssb diffusion also melts short dna hairpins transiently stimulates reca filament elongation dna secondary structure observation diffusional movement protein ssdna introduces new model ssb protein can redistributed remaining tightly bound ssdna recombination repair processes
