atomically resolved single-walled carbon nanotube intramolecular junctions 
intramolecular junctions single-walled carbon nanotubes potentially ideal structures building robust molecular-scale electronics studied theoretically atomic level scanning tunneling microscopy used determine atomic structure electronic properties junctions single-walled nanotube samples metal-semiconductor junctions found exhibit electronically sharp interface without localized junction states whereas diffuse interface low-energy states found metal-metal junctions tight-binding calculations models based observed atomic structures show good agreement spectroscopy provide insight topological defects forming intramolecular junctions these: studies important implications applications present materials provide means assessing efforts designed tailor intramolecular junctions nanoelectronics
