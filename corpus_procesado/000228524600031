high-mass protostars silhouette young stellar object m17-s01
birth massive stars well understood- contrast formation process low-mass stars like sun even clear massive stars can form single entities rather might form mergers smaller ones born tight groups recent claim discovery massive protostar m17 nearby giant ionized region forming mechanism low-mass stars therefore generated considerable interest show protostar intermediate mass solar masses m contrary earlier claim ref surrounding circumstellar envelope contains 09m much extended local molecular cloud 9m
