gigaxonin-controlled degradation map1b light chain critical neuronal survival
giant axonal neuropathy gan devastating sensory motor neuropathy caused mutations gan gene encodes ubiquitously expressed protein gigaxonin- cytopathological features gan include axonal degeneration accumulation aggregation cytoskeletal components- little currently known molecular mechanisms underlying recessive disorder show gigaxonin controls protein degradation essential neuronal function survival present evidence gigaxonin binds ubiquitin-activating enzyme e1 amino-terminal btb domain carboxy-terminal kelch repeat domain interacts directly light chain lc microtubule-associated protein 1b map1b overexpression gigaxonin leads enhanced degradation map1b-lc can antagonized proteasome inhibitors ablation gigaxonin causes substantial accumulation map1b-lc gan-null neurons moreover show overexpression map1b wild-type cortical neurons leads cell death characteristic gan-null neurons whereas reducing map1b levels significantly improves survival rate null neurons results identify gigaxonin ubiquitin scaffolding protein controls map1b-lc degradation provide insight molecular mechanisms underlying human neurodegenerative disorders
