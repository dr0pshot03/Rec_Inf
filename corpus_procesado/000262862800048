calcineurin/nfat signaling required neuregulin-regulated schwann cell differentiation
schwann cells develop multipotent neural crest cells form myelin sheaths around axons allow rapid transmission action potentials neuregulin signaling erbb receptor regulates schwann cell development however downstream pathways fully defined find mice lacking calcineurin b1 neural crest defects schwann cell differentiation myelination neuregulin addition schwann cell precursors initiates increase cytoplasmic ca+ activates calcineurin downstream transcription factors nfatc3 c4 purification nfat protein complexes shows sox10 nfat nuclear partner synergizes nfatc4 activate krox20 regulates genes necessary myelination studies demonstrate calcineurin nfat essential neuregulin erbb signaling neural crest diversification differentiation schwann cells
