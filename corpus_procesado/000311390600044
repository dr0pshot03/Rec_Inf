dedifferentiation neurons astrocytes oncogenes can induce gliomas mice
glioblastoma multiforme gbm common aggressive malignant primary brain tumor humans show gliomas can originate differentiated cells central nervous system cns including cortical neurons transduction oncogenic lentiviral vectors neural stem cells nscs astrocytes even mature neurons brains mice can give rise malignant gliomas tumors irrespective site lentiviral vector injection initiating population shared common features high expression stem progenitor markers low expression differentiation markers microarray analysis revealed tumors astrocytic neuronal origin match mesenchymal gbm subtype propose differentiated cells cns upon defined genetic alterations undergo dedifferentiation generate nsc progenitor state initiate maintain tumor progression well give rise heterogeneous populations observed malignant gliomas
