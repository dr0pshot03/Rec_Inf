chromatin connectivity maps reveal dynamic promoter-enhancer long-range associations 
multicellular organisms transcription regulation one central mechanisms modelling lineage differentiation cell-fate determination transcription requires dynamic chromatin configurations promoters corresponding distal regulatory elements believed communication occurs within large discrete foci aggregated rna polymerases termed transcription factories three-dimensional nuclear space however dynamic nature chromatin connectivity characterized genome-wide level chromatin interaction analysis paired-end tagging approach- using antibody primarily recognizes pre-initiation complexes rna polymerase ii6 explore transcriptional interactomes three mouse cells progressive lineage commitment including pluripotent embryonic stem cells neural stem cells neurosphere stem/progenitor cells global chromatin connectivity maps reveal approximately long-range interactions suggest precise enhancer-promoter associations delineate cell-type-specific chromatin structures analysis complex regulatory repertoire shows extensive colocalizations among promoters distal-acting enhancers enhancers associate promoters located beyond nearest active genes indicating linear juxtaposition guiding principle driving enhancer target selection although promoter-enhancer interactions exhibit high cell-type specificity promoters involved interactions found generally common mostly active among different cells chromatin connectivity networks reveal pivotal genes reprogramming functions transcribed within physical proximity embryonic stem cells linking chromatin architecture coordinated gene expression study sets stage full-scale dissection spatial temporal genome structures roles orchestrating development
