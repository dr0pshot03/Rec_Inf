regional climate shifts caused gradual global cooling pliocene epoch
earths climate undergone global transition past four million years warm conditions global surface temperatures 3degreesc warmer today smaller ice sheets higher sea levels current cooler conditions tectonic changes influence ocean heat transport suggested forcing factors transition including onset significant northern hemisphere glaciation similar to2 million years ago ultimate causes climatic changes still debate compare climate records high latitudes subtropical regions tropics indicating onset large glacial/interglacial cycles coincide specific climate reorganization event lower latitudes regional differences timing cooling imply global cooling gradual process rather response single threshold episodic event previously suggested also find high-latitude climate sensitivity variations solar heating increased gradually culminating cool tropical subtropical upwelling conditions established two million years ago results suggest mean low-latitude climate conditions can significantly influence global climate feedbacks
