basal dromaeosaurid size evolution preceding avian flight 
fossil evidence changes dinosaurs near lineage leading birds origin flight sparse dinosaur mongolia represents basal divergence within dromaeosauridae taxons small body size phylogenetic position imply extreme miniaturization ancestral paraves clade including avialae troodontidae dromaeosauridae phylogenetically earlier flight evolution strongly inferred contrast sustained small body sizes among avialans throughout cretaceous period two dinosaurian lineages closely related birds dromaeosaurids troodontids underwent four independent events gigantism lineages size increased nearly three orders magnitude thus change theropod body size leading flights origin unidirectional
