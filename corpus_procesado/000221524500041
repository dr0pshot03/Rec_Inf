discovery directed evolution glyphosate tolerance gene
herbicide glyphosate effectively detoxified n-acetylation screened collection microbial isolates discovered enzymes exhibiting glyphosate n-acetyltransferase gat activity kinetic properties discovered enzymes insufficient confer glyphosate tolerance transgenic organisms eleven iterations dna shuffling improved enzyme efficiency nearly four orders magnitude mm- min- mm- min- fifth iteration beyond gat enzymes conferred increasing glyphosate tolerance escherichia coli arabidopsis tobacco maize glyphosate acetylation provides alternative strategy supporting glyphosate use crops
