rna polymerase iv directs silencing endogenous dna 
plants encode subunits fourth rna polymerase pot iv addition well-known dna-dependent rna polymerases ii iii mutation two largest subunits nrpd1a nrpd2 show pot iv silences certain transposons repetitive dna short interfering rna pathway involving rna-dependent rna polymerase dicer-like existence distinct silencing polymerase may explain paradoxical involvement rna silencing pathway maintenance transcriptional silencing
