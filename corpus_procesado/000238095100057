modulation intracortical synaptic potentials presynaptic somatic membrane potential
traditionally neuronal operations cerebral cortex viewed occurring interaction synaptic potentials dendrite soma followed initiation action potential typically axon propagation action potential synaptic terminals widely believed form rapid communication information soma axonal synapses hence postsynaptic neurons show voltage fluctuations associated dendrosomatic synaptic activity propagate significant distances along axon modest changes somatic membrane potential presynaptic neuron modulate amplitude duration axonal action potentials ca2+-dependent mechanism average amplitude postsynaptic potential evoked spikes results indicate synaptic activity dendrite soma controls pattern action potentials generated also amplitude synaptic potentials action potentials initiate local cortical circuits resulting synaptic transmission mixture triggered graded analogue signals
