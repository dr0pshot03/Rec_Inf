anterior prefrontal function limits human decision-making
frontopolar cortex fpc anterior part frontal lobes forms apex executive system underlying decision-making review empirical evidence showing fpc function enables contingent interposition two concurrent behavioral plans mental tasks according respective reward expectations overcoming serial constraint bears upon control task execution prefrontal cortex function mechanistically explained interactions fpc neighboring prefrontal regions however capacity appears highly limited suggests fpc efficient protecting execution long-term mental plans immediate environmental demands generating new possibly rewarding behavioral cognitive sequences rather complex decision-making reasoning
