cca-adding enzyme selects adenine cytosine position trna 
cca-adding enzymes [atpctp:trna nucleotidyltransferases] add cca onto end transfer rna trna precursors without using nucleic acid template although mechanism cytosine c selected position trna established mechanism adenine selected position remains elusive report five cocrystal structures enzyme complexed trna mimic nucleoside triphosphates catalytically active conditions structures suggest adenosine -monophosphate incorporated onto a76 position trna via carboxylate-assisted one-metal-ion mechanism aspartate functioning general base discrimination incorporation cytidine -triphosphate ctp position arises improper placement alpha phosphate incoming ctp results interaction c arginine prevents nucleophilic attack hydroxyl group cytidine75
