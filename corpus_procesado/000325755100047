invasive chytrid fungus amphibians paralyzes lymphocyte responses 
chytrid fungus batrachochytrium dendrobatidis causes chytridiomycosis major contributor global amphibian declines although amphibians robust immune defenses clearance pathogen impaired inhibition host immunity common survival strategy pathogenic fungi hypothesized b dendrobatidis evades clearance inhibiting immune functions found b dendrobatidis cells supernatants impaired lymphocyte proliferation induced apoptosis; however fungal recognition phagocytosis macrophages neutrophils impaired fungal inhibitory factors resistant heat acid protease production absent zoospores reduced nikkomycin z suggesting may components cell wall evasion host immunity may explain pathogen devastated amphibian populations worldwide
