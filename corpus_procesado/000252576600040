centromeric aurora-b activation requires td- microtubules substrate priming phosphorylation
chromosome passenger complex cpc controls chromosome congression kinetochore microtubule attachments spindle checkpoint signaling mitosis aurora b kinase catalytic subunit cpc understand single kinase can regulate diverse events investigated activation aurora b describe two distinct activation mechanisms first aurora b activation vitro requires two cofactors telophase disc-60kd td- microtubules td critical localize cpc haspin kinase activity centromeres thus regulates aurora b several levels second aurora b substrates can inhibit kinase activation relieved phosphorylation substrates centromeric kinases plk1 haspin regulatory mechanisms suggest models phosphorylation aurora b centromeric substrates unaligned chromosomes merotelic attachments
