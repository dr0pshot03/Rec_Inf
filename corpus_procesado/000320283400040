sodium content predictor advanced evolution globular cluster stars 
asymptotic giant branch agb phase final stage nuclear burning low-mass stars although milky way globular clusters now known harbour least two generations stars12 still provide relatively homogeneous samples stars used constrain stellar evolution theory3- predicted stellar models majority cluster stars masses around current turn-off mass mass stars currently leaving main sequence phase will evolve agb phase67 report second-generation stars globular cluster ngc - per cent cluster population-fail reach agb phase spectroscopic abundance measurements found every agb star sample low sodium abundance indicating exclusively first-generation stars implies many clusters reliably used star counts test stellar evolution timescales agb population included clear explanation observation
