factors determining crystal-liquid coexistence shear
interaction imposed shear flow order disorder transition underlies broad range phenomena influence shear flow variety soft matter- observed spontaneously form bands characterized different local order-for example thermotropic liquid crystals subjected shear flow exhibit rich phase behaviour stability order influence shear flow also fundamental understanding frictional wear lubrication although exists well developed theoretical approach influence shear flow continuous transitions fluid mixtures little known underlying principles governing non-equilibrium coexistence phases different symmetry show using non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations system spherical particles stationary coexistence exists strained crystal shearing liquid coexistence accounted invoking non-equilibrium analogue chemical potential instead thermodynamic arguments argue balancing crystal growth rate rate surface erosion shearing melt can account observed coexistence
