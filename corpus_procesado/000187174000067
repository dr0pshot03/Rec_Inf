anterior-posterior guidance commissural axons wnt-frizzled signaling 
commissural neurons mammalian dorsal spinal cord send axons ventrally toward floor plate cross midline turn anteriorly toward brain gradient chemoattractants inside spinal cord controls turning rodents several wnt proteins stimulate extension commissural axons midline crossing postcrossing found wnt4 messenger rna expressed decreasing anterior-to-posterior gradient floor plate directed source wnt4 protein attracted postcrossing commissural axons commissural axons mice lacking wnt receptor frizzled3 displayed anterior-posterior guidance defects midline crossing thus wnt-frizzled signaling guides commissural axons along anterior-posterior axis spinal cord
