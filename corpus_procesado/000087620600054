two-headed binding processive myosin f-actin
myosins motor proteins cells move along actin changing shape making stereospecific interactions actin subunits arranged helically succession steps will follow helical path however myosin heads long enough span actin helical repeat similar nm linear motion possible muscle myosin myosin ii heads nm long insufficient span repeat myosin v however heads nm span nm refs thus allow single two-headed molecules transport cargo walking straight use electron microscopy show working myosin v spans helical repeat heads mostly actin subunits apart values also found typically structure polar one head curved straighter single particle processing reveals polarity underlying actin filament showing curved head leading one shape leading head may correspond beginning working stroke motor also observe molecules attached one head conformation
