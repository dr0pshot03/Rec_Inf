genes act downstream daf- influence lifespan caenorhabditis elegans 
ageing fundamental unsolved mystery biology daf- foxo-family transcription factor influences rate ageing caenorhabditis elegans response insulin/insulin-like growth factor igf-i signalling using dna microarray analysis found daf- affects expression set genes early adulthood time pathway known control ageing find many genes influence ageing process insulin/igf-i pathway functions cell non-autonomously regulate lifespan findings suggest signals cells least part feedback regulation insulin/igf-i homologue furthermore findings suggest insulin/igf-i pathway ultimately exerts effect lifespan upregulating wide variety genes including cellular stress-response antimicrobial metabolic genes downregulating specific life-shortening genes
