probing individual environmental bacteria viruses using microfluidic digital pcr 
viruses may well abundant biological entities planet yet neither metagenomic studies classical phage isolation techniques shed much light identity hosts viruses used microfluidic digital polymerase chain reaction pcr approach physically link single bacterial cells harvested natural environment viral marker gene implemented technique microbial community residing termite hindgut found genus-wide infection patterns displaying remarkable intragenus selectivity viral marker allelic diversity revealed restricted mixing alleles hosts indicating limited lateral gene transfer alleles despite host proximity approach require culturing hosts viruses provides method examining virus-bacterium interactions many environments
