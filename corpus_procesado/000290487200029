controllability complex networks 
ultimate proof understanding natural technological systems reflected ability control although control theory offers mathematical tools steering engineered natural systems towards desired state framework control complex self-organized systems lacking develop analytical tools study controllability arbitrary complex directed network identifying set driver nodes time-dependent control can guide systems entire dynamics apply tools several real networks finding number driver nodes determined mainly networks degree distribution show sparse inhomogeneous networks emerge many real complex systems difficult control dense homogeneous networks can controlled using driver nodes counterintuitively find model real systems driver nodes tend avoid high-degree nodes
