aid stabilizes stem-cell phenotype removing epigenetic memory pluripotency genes
activation-induced cytidine deaminase aid also known aicda enzyme required somatic hypermutation class switch recombination immunoglobulin locus germinal-centre b cells aid highly expressed inherent mutator activity helps generate antibody diversity however aid may also regulate gene expression epigenetically directly deaminating methylcytosine concert base-excision repair exchange cytosine pathway promotes gene demethylation thereby removing epigenetic memory example aid promotes active demethylation genome primordial germ cells however different studies suggested either requirement lack function aid promoting pluripotency somatic nuclei fusion embryonic stem cells tested directly whether aid regulates epigenetic memory comparing relative ability cells lacking aid reprogram differentiated murine cell type induced pluripotent stem cell show aid-null cells transiently hyper-responsive reprogramming process although initiate expression pluripotency genes fail stabilize pluripotent state genome aid-null cells remains hypermethylated reprogramming cells hypermethylated genes associated pluripotency fail stably upregulated including many myc target genes recent studies identified late step reprogramming associated methylation status implicated secondary set pluripotency network components aid regulates late step removing epigenetic memory stabilize pluripotent state
