extinction conditioned fear memories requires plasticity infralimbic medial prefrontal cortex il mpfc little known molecular mechanisms involved brain-derived neurotrophic factor bdnf key mediator synaptic plasticity multiple brain areas rats subjected auditory fear conditioning bdnf infused il mpfc reduced conditioned fear hours even absence extinction training suggests bdnf substituted extinction similar extinction bdnf-induced reduction fear required n-methyl-d-aspartate receptors erase original fear memory rats failing learn extinction showed reduced bdnf hippocampal inputs il mpfc augmenting bdnf pathway prevented extinction failure hence boosting bdnf activity hippocampal-infralimbic circuits may ameliorate disorders learned fear
