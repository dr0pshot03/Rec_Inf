gene loops enhance transcriptional directionality 
eukaryotic genomes extensively transcribed forming messenger rnas mrnas noncoding rnas ncrnas ncrnas made rna polymerase ii often initiate bidirectional promoters nucleosome-depleted chromatin synthesize mrna ncrna opposite directions demonstrate adopting gene-loop conformation actively transcribed mrna encoding genes restrict divergent transcription ncrnas gene-loop formation depends protein factor ssu72 coassociates promoter terminator inactivation ssu72 leads increased synthesis promoter-associated divergent ncrnas referred ssu72-restricted transcripts srts similarly inactivation individual gene loops gene mutation enhances srt synthesis demonstrate gene-loop conformation enforces transcriptional directionality otherwise bidirectional promoters
