biodiversity barrier ecological invasion
biological invasions pervasive costly environmental problem focus intense management research activities past half century yet accurate predictions community susceptibility invasion remain elusive diversity resistance hypothesis argues diverse communities highly competitive readily resist invasion- supported theory experimental studies- conducted small spatial scales however also convincing evidence relationship diversity native invading species positive measured regional scales although latter relationship may arise extrinsic factors resource heterogeneity covary diversity native invading species large scales mechanisms conferring greater invasion resistance diverse communities local scales remain unknown using neighbourhood analyses technique plant competition studies- show species diversity small experimental grassland plots enhances invasion resistance increasing crowding species richness localized plant neighbourhoods establishment number invaders success proportion invaders large invading plants reduced results suggest local biodiversity represents important line defence spread invaders
