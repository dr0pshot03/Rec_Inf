endogenous non-retroviral rna virus elements mammalian genomes 
retroviruses group viruses known left fossil record form endogenous proviruses approximately % human genome made elements although many viruses including non-retroviral rna viruses known generate dna forms genomes replication- none found dna germline animals bornaviruses genus non-segmented negative-sense rna virus unique among rna viruses establish persistent infection cell nucleus- show elements homologous nucleoprotein n gene bornavirus exist genomes several mammalian species including humans non-human primates rodents elephants sequences designated endogenous borna-like n ebln elements primate eblns contain intact open reading frame orf expressed mrna phylogenetic analyses showed eblns seem generated different insertional events specific animal family furthermore ebln ground squirrel formed recent integration event whereas primates must formed million years ago also show n mrna current mammalian bornavirus borna disease virus bdv can form ebln-like elements genomes persistently infected cultured cells results provide first evidence endogenization non-retroviral virus-derived elements mammalian genomes give novel insights generation endogenous elements also role bornavirus source genetic novelty host
