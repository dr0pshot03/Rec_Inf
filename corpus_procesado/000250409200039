synthetic lectin analog biomimetic disaccharide recognition
carbohydrate recognition biologically important intrinsically challenging nature host-guest chemists saccharides complex subtly variable camouflaged hydroxyl groups hinder discrimination substrate water developed rational strategy biomimetic recognition carbohydrates all-equatorial stereochemistry beta-glucose analogs homologs now applied disaccharides cellobiose synthetic receptor showed good affinities unlike lectins carbohydrate-binding proteins binding demonstrated nuclear magnetic resonance induced circular dichroism fluorescence spectroscopy calorimetry methods giving self-consistent results selectivity target substrates exceptional minor changes disaccharide structure instance cellobiose lactose caused almost complete suppression complex formation
