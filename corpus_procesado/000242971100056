axonal site spike initiation enhances auditory coincidence detection 
neurons initiate spikes axon initial segment first node axon- however yet understood site spike initiation affects neuronal activity function nucleus laminaris birds neurons behave coincidence detectors sound source localization encode interaural time differences itds separately characteristic frequency cf- show nucleus laminaris chick site spike initiation axon arranged distance soma achieve highest itd sensitivity cf na+ channels found soma high-cf - khz middle-cf - khz neurons clustered within short segment axon separated mu m soma low-cf - khz neurons clustered longer stretch axon closer soma thus neurons initiate spikes remote site cf neurons increases consequently somatic amplitudes orthodromic antidromic spikes small high-cf middle-cf neurons large low-cf neurons computer simulation showed geometry initiation site optimized reduce threshold spike generation increase itd sensitivity cf especially high-cf neurons distant localization spike initiation site improved itd sensitivity electrical isolation initiation site soma dendrites reduction na+-channel inactivation attenuating temporal summation synaptic potentials low-pass filtering along axon
