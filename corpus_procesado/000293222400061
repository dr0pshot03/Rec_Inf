bats use echo harmonic structure distinguish targets background clutter
echolocating big brown bats fly complex surroundings echoes arriving irrelevant objects clutter located sides sonar beam can mask perception relevant objects located front targets causing blind spots second harmonic beamed weakly sides first harmonic clutter echoes weaker second harmonic psychophysical experiments found electronically misaligning first second harmonics echoes mimic misalignment corresponding neural responses harmonics clutter echoes disrupts bats echo-delay perception also prevents clutter masking electronically offsetting harmonics realign neural responses restores delay perception also clutter interference thus bats exploit harmonics distinguish clutter echoes target echoes sacrificing delay acuity suppress masking
