caveolin- essential liver regeneration 
liver regeneration orchestrated cellular response coordinates cell activation lipid metabolism cell division found caveolin- gene disrupted mice cav1-/- mice exhibited impaired liver regeneration low survival partial hepatectomy hepatocytes showed dramatically reduced lipid droplet accumulation advance cell division cycle treatment cav1-/- mice glucose predominant energy substrate compared lipids drastically increased survival reestablished progression cell cycle thus caveolin- plays crucial role mechanisms coordinate lipid metabolism proliferative response occurring liver cellular injury
