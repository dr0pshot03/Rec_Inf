isotopic homogeneity iron early solar nebula 
chemical isotopic homogeneity early solar nebula processes producing fractionation evolution central issues cosmochemistry studies relative abundance variations three isotopes element can principle determine initial reservoir material homogeneous mixture contained several distinct sources precursor material example widespread anomalies- observed oxygen isotopes meteorites interpreted resulting mixing solid phase enriched o gas phase o depleted- isotopic memory galactic evolution either case anomalies regarded strong evidence early solar nebula initially homogeneous present measurements relative abundances three iron isotopes meteoritic terrestrial samples show significant variations iron isotopes exist terrestrial extraterrestrial materials plotted three-isotope diagram data solar system materials fall single mass-fractionation line showing homogenization iron isotopes occurred solar nebula planetesimal accretion chondrule formation
