evolvability hierarchy rewired bacterial gene networks 
sequencing dna several organisms revealed duplication drift existing genes primarily moulded contents given genome though effect knocking overexpressing particular gene studied many organisms study systematically explored effect adding new links biological network explore network evolvability constructed recombinations promoters including regulatory regions different transcription sigma-factor genes escherichia coli added wild type genetic background show similar % new networks tolerated bacteria alter growth expression level correlates factor position wild type network hierarchy importantly find certain networks consistently survive wild type various selection pressures therefore new links network rarely barrier evolution can even confer fitness advantage
