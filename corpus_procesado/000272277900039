common dependence stress two fundamental laws statistical seismology
two long-standing relationships statistical seismology power laws: gutenberg-richter relation describing earthquake frequency-magnitude distribution omori-utsu law characterizing temporal decay aftershock rate following main shock recently effect stress slope b value earthquake frequency-magnitude distribution determined investigations faulting-style dependence b value similar manner study aftershock sequences according faulting style main shocks show time delay onset power-law aftershock decay rate c value average shorter thrust main shocks normal fault earthquakes taking intermediate values strike-slip events similar dependences faulting style indicate fundamental power laws governed state stress focal mechanisms known per cent aftershocks therefore c b values independent estimates can used new tools infer stress field remains difficult measure directly
