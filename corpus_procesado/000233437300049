golgi duplication trypanosoma brucei requires centrin2
centrins highly conserved components centrosome parasitic protozoan t brucei comprises basal body nucleates flagellum used locomotion found tbcentrin2 additional bi-lobed structure near golgi apparatus one lobe associated old golgi became associated newly forming golgi cell grew depletion tbcentrin1 inhibited duplication basal body whereas depletion tbcentrin2 also inhibited duplication golgi thus centrin2-containing structure distinct basal body appears mark site new golgi assembly
