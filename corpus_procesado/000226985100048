liquid carbon carbon-glass beads crystallization carbon nanotubes 
formation carbon nanotubes pure carbon arc helium atmosphere found involve liquid carbon electron microscopy shows viscous liquid-like amorphous carbon layer covering surfaces nanotube-containing millimeter-sized columnar structures cathode deposit composed regularly spaced submicrometer-sized spherical beads amorphous carbon often found nanotubes surfaces columns apparently anode liquid-carbon drops form acquire carbon-glass surface due rapid evaporative cooling nanotubes crystallize inside supercooled glass-coated liquid-carbon drops carbon-glass layer ultimately coats beads nanotubes near surface
