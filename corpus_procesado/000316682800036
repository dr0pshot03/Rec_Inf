x-ray analysis nanogram microgram scale using porous complexes
x-ray single-crystal diffraction scd analysis intrinsic limitation target molecules must obtained single crystals report protocol scd analysis require crystallization sample method tiny crystals porous complexes soaked solution target complexes can absorb target molecules crystallographic analysis clearly determines absorbed guest structures along host frameworks scd analysis carried one tiny crystal complex required sample mass nanogram-microgram order demonstrate little nanograms sample enough scd analysis combination high-performance liquid chromatography protocol allows direct characterization multiple fractions establishing prototypical means liquid chromatography scd analysis furthermore unambiguously determined structure scarce marine natural product using micrograms compound
