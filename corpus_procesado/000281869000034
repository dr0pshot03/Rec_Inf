quantum walks correlated photons 
quantum walks correlated particles offer possibility studying large-scale quantum interference simulating biological chemical physical systems providing route universal quantum computation demonstrated quantum walks two identical photons array continuously evanescently coupled waveguides sioxny chip observed quantum correlations violating classical limit standard deviations found correlations depended critically input state quantum walk results present powerful approach achieving quantum walks correlated particles encode information exponentially larger state space
