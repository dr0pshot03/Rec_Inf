rna exosome depletion reveals transcription upstream active human promoters
studies shown bulk eukaryotic genomes transcribed transcriptome maps frequently updated low abundant transcripts probably gone unnoticed eliminate rna degradation depleted exonucleolytic rna exosome human cells subjected rna tiling microarray analysis revealed class short polyadenylated highly unstable rnas promoter upstream transcripts prompts produced similar kilobases upstream active transcription start sites prompt transcription occurs sense antisense directions respect downstream gene addition requires presence gene promoter positively correlated gene activity propose prompt transcription common characteristic rna polymerase ii rnapii transcribed genes possible regulatory potential
