plant diversity niche complementarity progressively stronger effects ecosystem functioning year experiment species plots attaining times greater biomass monocultures diversity effects neither transients explained solely productive unviable species rather many higher-diversity plots outperformed best monoculture results help resolve debate biodiversity ecosystem functioning show effects higher expected diversity levels demonstrate ecosystems even best-chosen monocultures achieve greater productivity carbon stores higher-diversity sites
