high-frequency acoustic waves sufficient heat solar chromosphere 
one main unanswered questions solar physics suns outer atmosphere hotter surface theory predicts abundant production high-frequency mhz acoustic waves subsurface layers sun waves believed many constitute dominant heating mechanism chromosphere lower part outer solar atmosphere non-magnetic regions- high-frequency waves difficult detect high-frequency disturbances earths atmosphere seeing factors report detection high-frequency waves use numerical simulations show acoustic energy flux waves low factor least ten balance radiative losses solar chromosphere acoustic waves therefore constitute dominant heating mechanism solar chromosphere
