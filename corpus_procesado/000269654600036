co-translational mrna decay saccharomyces cerevisiae 
rates rna decay transcription determine steady-state levels allmessenger rna can subject regulation although details transcriptional regulation becoming increasingly understood mechanisms controlling mrna decay remain unclear yeast major pathway mrna decay begins deadenylation followed decapping - exonuclease digestion importantly hypothesized ribosomes must removed mrna transcripts destroyed contrary prediction show decay takes place mrnas associated actively translating ribosomes data indicate dissociation ribosomes mrna prerequisite decay suggest - polarity mrna degradation evolved ensure last translocating ribosome can complete translation
