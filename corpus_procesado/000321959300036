switchable static dynamic self-assembly magnetic droplets superhydrophobic surfaces 
self-assembly process interacting bodies autonomously driven ordered structures static structures crystals often form simple energy minimization whereas dynamic ones require continuous energy input grow sustain dynamic systems ubiquitous nature biology proven challenging understand engineer bridge gap static dynamic self-assembly introducing model system based ferrofluid droplets superhydrophobic surfaces droplets self-assemble static external magnetic field simple patterns can switched complicated dynamic dissipative structures applying time-varying magnetic field transition static dynamic patterns involves kinetic trapping shows complexity can directly visualized
