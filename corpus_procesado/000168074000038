real-space imaging nucleation growth colloidal crystallization 
crystallization concentrated colloidal suspensions studied real space laser scanning confocal microscopy direct imaging three dimensions allowed identification observation nucleation growth crystalline regions providing experimental measure properties nucleating crystallites following evolution identified critical nuclei determined nucleation rates measured average surface tension crystal-liquid interface structure nuclei bulk solid phase random hexagonal close-packed average shape rather nonspherical rough rather faceted surfaces
