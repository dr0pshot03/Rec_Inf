arginylation beta-actin regulates actin cytoskeleton cell motility
posttranslational arginylation critical mouse embryogenesis cardiovascular development angiogenesis molecular effects identity proteins arginylated vivo unknown found beta-actin arginylated vivo regulate actin filament properties beta-actin localization lamella formation motile cells arginylation beta-actin apparently represents critical step actin n-terminal processing needed actin functioning vivo thus posttranslational arginylation single protein target can regulate intracellular function inducing global changes cellular level may contribute cardiovascular development angiogenesis
