replication fork movement sets chromatin loop size origin choice mammalian cells
genome stability requires one one dna duplication s phase mechanisms preventing origin firing newly replicated dna well documented much less known mechanisms controlling spacing initiation events namely completion dna replication show origin use chinese hamster cells depends movement replication forks organization chromatin loops found slowing replication speed triggers recruitment latent origins within minutes allowing completion s phase timely fashion slowly replicating cells shifted conditions fast fork progression although decrease overall number active origins occurs within h cells still go complete cell cycle efficiency specific origin restored observed strict correlation replication speed given s phase size chromatin loops next g1 phase furthermore found origins located near sites anchorage chromatin loops g1 activated preferentially following s phase data suggest mechanism origin programming replication speed determines spacing anchorage regions chromatin loops turn controls choice initiation sites
