repetitive shuttling motor protein dna 
many helicases modulate recombination essential process needs tightly controlled mutations human disease helicases cause increased recombination genome instability cancer elucidate potential mode action enzymes developed single-molecule fluorescence assay can visualize dna binding translocation escherichia coli rep superfamily dna helicase homologous saccharomyces cerevisiae srs2 individual rep monomers observed move single-stranded ss dna direction using atp hydrolysis strikingly hitting blockade duplex dna streptavidin protein abruptly snapped back close initial position followed cycles translocation snapback repetitive shuttling likely caused blockade-induced protein conformational change enhances dna affinity proteins secondary dna binding site thereby resulting transient dna loop repetitive shuttling also observed ssdna bounded stalled replication fork okazaki fragment analogue presence rep delayed formation filament recombination protein reca ssdna thus binding single rep monomer stalled replication fork can lead repetitive shuttling along single-stranded region possibly keeping dna clear toxic recombination intermediates
