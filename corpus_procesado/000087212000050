targeted destabilization hy5 light-regulated development arabidopsis 
arabidopsis seedlings display contrasting developmental patterns depending ambient light seedlings grown light develop photomorphogenically characterized short hypocotyls expanded green cotyledons contrast seedlings grown darkness become etiolated elongated hypocotyls closed cotyledons apical hook light signals perceived multiple photoreceptors transduced downstream regulators dictate extent photomorphogenic development quantitative manner two key downstream components cop1 hy5 act antagonistically regulating seedling development hy5 bzip transcription factor binds directly promoters light-inducible genes promoting expression photomorphogenic development cop1 ring-finger protein wd repeats whose nuclear abundance negatively regulated light cop1 interacts directly hy5 nucleus regulate activity negatively show abundance hy5 directly correlated extent photomorphogenic development cop1-hy5 interaction may specifically target hy5 proteasome-mediated degradation nucleus
