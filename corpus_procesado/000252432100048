dry mantle transition zone inferred conductivity wadsleyite ringwoodite 
earths mantle transition zone potentially store large amount water minerals wadsleyite ringwoodite incorporate significant amount water crystal structure12 water content transition zone can estimated electrical conductivities hydrous wadsleyite ringwoodite although estimates depend accurate knowledge two conduction mechanisms minerals small polaron proton conductions early studies failed distinguish between34 report electrical conductivity two minerals obtained high pressure multi anvil experiments found small polaron conductions minerals substantially lower previously estimated contributions proton conduction small temperatures corresponding mantle transition zone conductivity wadsleyite considerably lower ringwoodite mechanisms dry model mantle shows considerable conductivity jumps associated olivine wadsleyite wadsleyite ringwoodite post spinel transitions dry model explains well currently available conductivity depth profiles5 obtained geoelectromagnetic studies therefore conclude need introduce significant amount water mantle transition satisfy electrical conductivity constraints
