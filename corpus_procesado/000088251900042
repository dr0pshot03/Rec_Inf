non-collinear states magnetic sensors 
certain materials electrical conductivity extremely sensitive applied magnetic field phenomenon termed giant magnetoresistance- can used sensor applications typically device comprises several ferromagnetic layers separated non-magnetic spacer layers-a so-called super-lattice geometry- absence magnetic field ferromagnetic layers may magnetized opposite directions interlayer exchange coupling applied external magnetic field causes magnetization directions become parallel resistivity depends magnetization direction applied field changes magnetic configuration may detected simply measuring change resistance order detect weak fields energy difference different magnetization directions small usually achieved using many non-magnetic atomic spacer layers show using first-principles theory materials combinations fe/v/co multilayers can produce non-collinear magnetic state magnetization direction fe co layers differs degrees state energetically almost degenerate collinear magnetic states even though number non-magnetic vanadium spacer layers quite small
