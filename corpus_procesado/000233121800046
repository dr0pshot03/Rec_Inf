regulated pole-to-pole oscillations bacterial gliding motility protein 
little known directed motility bacteria move type ivpilus-mediated twitching motility found periodic cell reversals myxoccocus xanthus type iv pili disassembled one pole reassembled pole accompanying reversals frzs protein required directed motility moved oscillatory pattern cell poles frequency oscillations controlled frz chemosensory system essential directed motility pole-to-pole migration frzs appeared involve movement along filament running length cell frzs dynamics may thus regulate cell polarity directed motility
