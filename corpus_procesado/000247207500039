demonstration controlled-not quantum gates pair superconducting quantum bits
quantum computation requires quantum logic gates use interaction within pairs quantum bits qubits perform conditional operations superconducting qubits may offer attractive route towards scalable quantum computing previous experiments coupled superconducting qubits conditional gate behaviour entanglement demonstrated demonstrate selective execution complete set four different controlled-not cnot quantum logic gates applying microwave pulses appropriate frequency single pair coupled flux qubits two-qubit computational basis states superpositions used input two independent single-shot squid detectors measure output state including qubit qubit correlations determined gates truth table directly measuring state transfer amplitudes acquiring relevant quantum phase shift using ramsey-like interference experiment four conditional gates result symmetry qubits pair: either qubit can assume role control target gate action can conditioned either state state gates now sufficiently characterized used quantum algorithms together form efficient set versatile building blocks
