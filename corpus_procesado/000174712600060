molecular determinants tissue specificity serms
selective estrogen receptor modulators serms mimic estrogen action certain tissues opposing others therapeutic effectiveness serms tamoxifen raloxifene breast cancer depends antiestrogenic activity uterus however tamoxifen estrogenic show tamoxifen raloxifene induce recruitment corepressors target gene promoters mammary cells endometrial cells tamoxifen raloxifene acts like estrogen stimulating recruitment coactivators subset genes estrogen-like activity tamoxifen uterus requires high level steroid receptor coactivator src- expression thus cell type promoter-specific differences coregulator recruitment determine cellular response serms
