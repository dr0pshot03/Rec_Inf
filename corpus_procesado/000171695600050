regulation cutaneous malignancy gamma delta t cells 
localization gamma delta t cells within epithelia suggests cells may contribute down-regulation epithelial malignancies report mice lacking gamma delta cells highly susceptible multiple regimens cutaneous carcinogenesis exposure carcinogens skin cells expressed rae h60 major histocompatibility complex-related molecules structurally resembling human mica ligand nkg2d receptor expressed cytolytic t cells natural killernk cells vitro skin-associated nkg2d+ gamma delta cells killed skin carcinoma cells mechanism sensitive blocking nkg2d engagement thus local t cells may use evolutionarily conserved proteins negatively regulate malignancy
