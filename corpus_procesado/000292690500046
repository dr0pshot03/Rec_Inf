measurement internal state single atom without energy exchange 
measurement necessarily changes quantum state measured phenomenon known back-action real measurements however almost always cause much stronger back-action required laws quantum mechanics quantum non-demolition measurements devised1- keep additional back-action entirely within observables one measured however back-action observables often imposes constraints particular free-space optical detection methods single atoms ions shelving technique7 sensitive well-developed method inevitably require spontaneous scattering even dispersive regime8 causes irreversible energy exchange heating limitation atom-based quantum information processing obviates straightforward reuse qubit energy exchange required quantum mechanics9 experimentally demonstrate optical detection atomic qubit significantly less one spontaneous scattering event measure transmission reflection optical cavity10- containing atom addition qubit detection quantitatively measure much spontaneous scattering occurred allows us relate information gained amount spontaneous emission obtain detection error per cent scattering less photons average furthermore performa quantum zeno-type experiment quantify measurement back-action find every incident photon leads almost complete state collapse together results constitute full experimental characterization quantum measurement energy exchange-free regime single spontaneous emission event besides fundamental interest approach significantly simplify proposed neutral-atom quantum computation schemes14 may enable sensitive detection molecules atoms lacking closed transitions
