spread behavior online social network experiment 
social networks affect spread behavior popular hypothesis states networks many clustered ties high degree separation will less effective behavioral diffusion networks locally redundant ties rewired provide shortcuts across social space competing hypothesis argues behaviors require social reinforcement network clustering may advantageous even network whole larger diameter investigated effects network structure diffusion studying spread health behavior artificially structured online communities individual adoption much likely participants received social reinforcement multiple neighbors social network behavior spread farther faster across clustered-lattice networks across corresponding random networks
