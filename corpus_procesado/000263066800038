formation massive star systems accretion 
massive stars produce much light radiation pressure exert gas dust around stronger gravitational attraction condition long expected prevent growing accretion present three dimensional radiation-hydrodynamic simulations collapse massive prestellar core find radiation pressure halt accretion instead gravitational rayleigh taylor instabilities channel gas onto star system nonaxisymmetric disks filaments self shield radiation allowing radiation escape optically thin bubbles gravitational instabilities cause disk fragment form massive companion primary star radiation pressure limit stellar masses instabilities allow accretion continue lead small multiple systems
