synthetic chromosome arms function yeast generate phenotypic diversity design
recent advances dna synthesis technology enabled construction novel genetic pathways genomic elements furthering understanding system-level phenomena- ability synthesize large segments dna allows engineering pathways genomes according arbitrary sets design principles describe synthetic yeast genome project sc2 first partially synthetic eukaryotic chromosomes saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosome synixr semi-synvil defined three design principles synthetic genome follows: first result near wild-type phenotype fitness second lack destabilizing elements trna genes transposons third genetic flexibility facilitate future studies synthetic genome features several systemic modifications complying design principles including inducible evolution system scramble synthetic chromosome rearrangement modification loxp-mediated evolution show utility scramble novel method combinatorial mutagenesis capable generating complex genotypes broad variety phenotypes complete fully synthetic genome will allow massive restructuring yeast genome may open door new type combinatorial genetics based entirely variations gene content copy number
