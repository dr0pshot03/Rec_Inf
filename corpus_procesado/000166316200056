modular enzymes 
although modular macromolecular devices encountered frequently variety biological situations occurrence biocatalysis widely appreciated three general classes modular biocatalysts can identified: enzymes catalysis substrate specificity separable multisubstrate enzymes binding sites individual substrates modular multienzyme systems can catalyse programmable metabolic pathways postgenomic era discovery systems can expected significant impact role enzymes synthetic process chemistry
