exogenous control mammalian gene expression modulation rna self-cleavage 
recent studies control specific metabolic pathways bacteria documented existence entirely rna-based mechanisms controlling gene expression mechanisms involve modulation translation transcription termination rna self-cleavage direct interaction specific intracellular metabolites rna sequences- show analogous rna-based gene regulation system can effectively designed mammalian cells via incorporation sequences encoding self-cleaving rna motifs transcriptional unit gene vector correctly positioned sequences lead potent inhibition gene vector expression owing spontaneous cleavage rna transcript administration either oligonucleotides complementary regions self-cleaving motif specific small molecule results efficient induction gene expression owing inhibition self-cleavage messenger rna efficient regulation transgene expression shown variety mammalian cell lines live animals conjunction emerging technologies methodology may particularly applicable development gene regulation systems tailored small inducer molecule provide novel means biological sensing vivo may important application regulated delivery protein therapeutics
