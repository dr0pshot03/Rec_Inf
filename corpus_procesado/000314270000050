variable clonal repopulation dynamics influence chemotherapy response colorectal cancer 
intratumoral heterogeneity arises evolution genetically diverse subclones tumor progression however remains unknown whether cells within single genetic clones functionally equivalent combining dna copy number alteration cna profiling sequencing lentiviral lineage tracking followed repopulation dynamics single lentivirus-marked lineages human colorectal cancers serial xenograft passages mice cna mutational analysis distinguished individual clones showed clones remained stable upon serial transplantation despite stability proliferation persistence chemotherapy tolerance lentivirally marked lineages variable within clone chemotherapy promoted dominance previously minor dormant lineages thus apart genetic diversity tumor cells display inherent functional variability tumor propagation potential contributes cancer growth therapy tolerance
