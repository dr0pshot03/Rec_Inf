promotion lymphocyte egress blood lymph distinct sources sphingosine--phosphate
lymphocytes require sphingosine--phosphate s1p receptor exit lymphoid organs sources extracellular s1p whether s1p directly promotes egress unknown using mice two kinases generate s1p conditionally ablated find plasma s1p mainly hematopoietic origin erythrocytes major contributor whereas lymph s1p distinct radiation-resistant source lymphocyte egress thymus secondary lymphoid organs markedly reduced kinase-deficient mice restoration s1p plasma rescued egress blood lymph rescue required lymphocyte expression s1p-receptor- thus separate sources provide s1p plasma lymph help lymphocytes exit low-s1p environment lymphoid organs disruption compartmentalized s1p signaling plausible mechanism s1p-receptor agonists function immunosuppressives
