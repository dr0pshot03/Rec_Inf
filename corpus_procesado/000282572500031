purified human brca2 stimulates rad51-mediated recombination
mutation breast cancer susceptibility gene brca2 leads breast ovarian cancers mechanistic insight functions human brca2 limited difficulty isolating large protein amino acids report purification full-length brca2 show binds rad51 potentiates recombinational dna repair promoting assembly rad51 onto single-stranded dna ssdna brca2 acts targeting rad51 ssdna double-stranded dna enabling rad51 displace replication protein-a rpa ssdna stabilizing rad51-ssdna filaments blocking atp hydrolysis brca2 anneal ssdna complexed rpa implying directly function repair processes involve ssdna annealing findings show brca2 key mediator homologous recombination provide molecular basis understanding dna repair process disrupted brca2 mutations lead chromosomal instability cancer
