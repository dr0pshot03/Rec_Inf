solar luminosity early earth significantly lower today therefore solar luminosity models suggest atmosphere early earth concentration greenhouse gases carbon dioxide methane must much higher however empirical estimates proterozoic levels atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations hitherto available present ion microprobe analyses carbon isotopes individual organic-walled microfossils extracted proterozoic similar to1-gigayear-old shale north china calculated magnitudes carbon isotope fractionation large morphologically complex microfossils suggest elevated levels carbon dioxide ancient atmosphere-between times present atmospheric level results indicate carbon dioxide important greenhouse gas periods lower solar luminosity probably dominating methane atmosphere hydrosphere became pervasively oxygenated gigayears ago
