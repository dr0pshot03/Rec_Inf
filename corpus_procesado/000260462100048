crystal structure stable dimer reveals molecular basis serpin polymerization
repeating intermolecular protein association means beta-sheet expansion mechanism underlying multitude diseases including alzheimers huntingtons parkinsons prion encephalopathies family proteins known serpins also forms large stable multimers ordered beta-sheet linkages leading intracellular accretion disease serpinopathies include early onset dementia caused mutations neuroserpin liver cirrhosis emphysema caused mutations alpha antitrypsin alphaat thrombosis caused mutations antithrombin serpin structure function quite well understood family therefore become model system understanding beta-sheet expansion disorders collectively known conformational diseases develop strategies prevent reverse disorders necessary determine structural basis intermolecular linkage pathogenic monomeric state report crystallographic structure stable serpin dimer reveals domain swap residues including two long antiparallel beta-strands inserting centre principal b-sheet neighbouring monomer structure explains extreme stability serpin polymers molecular basis rapid propagation provides critical new insights structural changes initiate irreversible beta-sheet expansion
