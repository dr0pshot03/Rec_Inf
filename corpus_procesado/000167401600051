filopodial calcium transients promote substrate-dependent growth cone turning 
filopodia extend neuronal growth cones sample environment extracellular guidance cues signals transmit growth cones unknown filopodia observed generating localized transient elevations intracellular calcium [ca2+]i propagate back growth cone stimulate global ca2+ elevations frequency filopodial ca2+ transients substrate-dependent may due part influx ca2+ channels activated integrin receptors transients slowed neurite outgrowth reducing filopodial motility promoted turning stimulated differentially within filopodia one side growth cone rapid signals appear serve autonomous regulators filopodial movement frequency-coded signals integrated within growth cone common signaling process many motile cells
