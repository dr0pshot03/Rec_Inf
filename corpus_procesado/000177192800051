single-cell gene expression profiling
key goal biology relate expression specific genes particular cellular phenotype however current assays gene expression destroy structural context combining advances computational fluorescence microscopy multiplex probe design devised technology expression many genes can visualized simultaneously inside single cells high spatial temporal resolution analysis genes serum-stimulated cultured cells revealed unique patterns gene expression within individual cells using nucleus substrate parallel gene analysis provide platform fusion genomics cell biology: cellular genomics
