head backbone early cambrian vertebrate haikouichthys
agnathan fish hold key position vertebrate evolution especially regarding origin head neural-crest-derived tissue contrast amphioxus lampreys vertebrates possess complex brain placodes contribute well-developed eyes well auditory olfactory systems sensory sytems arguably trigger subsequent vertebrate diversifications however although known skeletal impressions younger palaeozoic agnathans information earliest records systems largely wanting report numerous specimens lower cambrian vertebrate haikouichthys ercaicunensis now known holotype haikouichthys shows significant differences fossil agnathans: key features include small lobate extension head eyes possible nasal sacs well may otic capsules notochord separate vertebral elements also identifiable phylogenetic analysis indicates fish lies within stem-group craniates although haikouichthys somewhat resembles ammocoete larva modern lampreys shared general craniate characters adult lampreys hagfishes cyclostomes monophyletic probably derived many respects
