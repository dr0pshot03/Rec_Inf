niche partitioning among prochlorococcus ecotypes along ocean-scale environmental gradients 
prochlorococcus numerically dominant phytoplankter oligotrophic oceans accounting half photosynthetic biomass production regions describe abundance six known ecotypes small subunit ribosomal rna sequences differ less % changed along local basin-wide environmental gradients atlantic ocean temperature significantly correlated shifts ecotype abundance laboratory experiments confirmed different temperature optima tolerance ranges cultured strains light nutrients competitor abundances also appeared play role shaping different distributions
