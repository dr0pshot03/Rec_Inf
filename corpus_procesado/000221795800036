control measurement three-qubit entangled states 
report deterministic creation maximally entangled three-qubit states specifically greenberger horne zeilinger ghz state w state trapped-ion quantum computer read one qubits selectively show ghz w states affected local measurement additionally demonstrate conditional operations controlled results reading one qubit tripartite entanglement deterministically transformed bipartite entanglement local operations operations measurement one qubit ghz state rotated basis conditioned measurement result application single-qubit rotations
