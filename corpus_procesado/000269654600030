defining mechanisms regulate rna polymerase ii transcription vivo 
eukaryotic genome thousands genes encode messenger rna transcribed molecular machine called rna polymerase ii analysing distribution status rna polymerase ii across genome provided crucial insights long-standing mysteries transcription regulation studies identify points transcription cycle rna polymerase ii accumulates encountering rate-limiting step coupled genome-wide mapping transcription factors approaches identify key regulatory steps factors importantly provide understanding mechanistic generalities well rich diversities gene regulation
