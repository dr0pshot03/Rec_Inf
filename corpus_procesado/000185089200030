whole-mantle convection transition-zone water filter 
distinct chemical signatures ocean-island mid-ocean-ridge basalts traditionally inferred arise separate isolated reservoirs earths mantle mantle reservoir models however typically satisfy geochemical constraints geophysical observations propose alternative hypothesis rather divided isolated reservoirs mantle filtered km-deep discontinuity propose ascending ambient mantle forced downward flux subducting slabs rises high-water-solubility transition zone km km discontinuities low-solubility upper mantle km undergoes dehydration-induced partial melting filters incompatible elements filtered dry depleted solid phase continues rise become source material mid-ocean-ridge basalts wet enriched melt residue may denser surrounding solid accordingly trapped km boundary slab entrainment returns deeper mantle filter suppressed mantle plumes therefore generate wetter enriched ocean-island basalts well hotter archaean mantle thereby allowing early production enriched continental crust propose transition-zone water-filter model can explain many geochemical observations avoiding major pitfalls invoking isolated mantle reservoirs
