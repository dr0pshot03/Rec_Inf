three-butterfly system provides field test mullerian mimicry 
muller proposed two brightly coloured distasteful butterfly species co-models share single warning-colour pattern benefit spreading selective burden educating predators- mutual benefit sharing warning signals among distasteful species so-called mullerian mimicry supported comparative evidence theoretical studies laboratory simulations however date key exemplar adaptive evolution experimentally tested field measure natural selection generated mullerian mimicry exploited unusual polymorphism heliconius cydno lepidoptera: nymphalidae show increased survival h cydno morphs match locally abundant monomorphic co-model species study demonstrates mullerian mimicry field also shows mullerian mimicry several co-models generates geographically divergent selection explains existence polymorphism distasteful species warning coloration
