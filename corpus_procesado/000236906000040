spatiotemporal dynamics rhoa activity migrating cells
rho family gtpases regulate actin adhesion dynamics control cell migration current models postulate rac promotes membrane protrusion leading edge rhoa regulates contractility cell body however evidence rhoa also regulates membrane protrusion use fluorescent biosensor based novel design preserving reversible membrane interactions visualize spatiotemporal dynamics rhoa activity cell migration randomly migrating cells rhoa activity concentrated sharp band directly edge protrusions observed sporadically retracting tails low cell body rhoa activity also associated peripheral ruffles pinocytic vesicles dorsal ruffles induced platelet-derived growth factor pdgf contrast randomly migrating cells pdgf-induced membrane protrusions low rhoa activity potentially pdgf strongly activates rac previously shown antagonize rhoa activity data therefore show different extracellular cues induce distinct patterns rhoa signalling membrane protrusion
