super-compressible foamlike carbon nanotube films 
report freestanding films vertically aligned carbon nanotubes exhibit super-compressible foamlike behavior compression nanotubes collectively form zigzag buckles can fully unfold original length upon load release compared conventional low-density flexible foams nanotube films show much higher compressive strength recovery rate sag factor open-cell nature nanotube arrays gives excellent breathability nanotube films present class open-cell foam structures consisting well-arranged one-dimensional units nanotube struts lightweight highly resilient nanotube films may useful compliant energy-absorbing coatings
