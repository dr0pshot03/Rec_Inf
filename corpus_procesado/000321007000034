terabit-scale orbital angular momentum mode division multiplexing fibers 
internet data traffic capacity rapidly reaching limits imposed optical fiber nonlinear effects almost exhausted available degrees freedom orthogonally multiplex data possibility now explored using spatial modes fibers enhance data capacity demonstrate viability using orbital angular momentum oam light create orthogonal spatially distinct streams data-transmitting channels multiplexed single fiber kilometers specially designed optical fiber minimizes mode coupling achieved -gigabits-per-second data transmission using four angular momentum modes single wavelength terabits per second using two oam modes wavelengths demonstrations suggest oam provide additional degree freedom data multiplexing future fiber networks
