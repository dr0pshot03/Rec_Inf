intramembrane cleavage ama1 triggers toxoplasma switch invasive replicative mode
apicomplexan parasites invade host cells immediately initiate cell division extracellular parasite discharges transmembrane proteins onto surface mediate motility invasion shed intramembrane cleavage process associated invasion otherwise poorly understood functional analysis toxoplasma rhomboid surface intramembrane protease conditional overexpression catalytically inactive form produced profound block replication completely rescued expression cleaved cytoplasmic tail toxoplasma plasmodium apical membrane antigen ama1 results reveal unexpected function ama1 parasite replication suggest invasion proteins help promote parasite switch invasive replicative mode
