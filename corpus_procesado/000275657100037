comparative genomics reveals mobile pathogenicity chromosomes fusarium
fusarium species among important phytopathogenic toxigenic fungi understand molecular underpinnings pathogenicity genus fusarium compared genomes three phenotypically diverse species: fusarium graminearum fusarium verticillioides fusarium oxysporum f sp lycopersici analysis revealed lineage-specific ls genomic regions f oxysporum include four entire chromosomes account one-quarter genome ls regions rich transposons genes distinct evolutionary profiles related pathogenicity indicative horizontal acquisition experimentally demonstrate transfer two ls chromosomes strains f oxysporum converting non-pathogenic strain pathogen transfer ls chromosomes otherwise genetically isolated strains explains polyphyletic origin host specificity emergence new pathogenic lineages f oxysporum findings put evolution fungal pathogenicity new perspective
