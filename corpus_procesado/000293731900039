induction human neuronal cells defined transcription factors 
somatic cell nuclear transfer cell fusion expression lineage-specific factors shown induce cell-fate changes diverse somatic cell types1- recently observed forced expression combination three transcription factors brn2 also known pou3f2 ascl1 myt1l can efficiently convert mouse fibroblasts functional induced neuronal cells13 show three factors can generate functional neurons human pluripotent stem cells early days transgene activation combined basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor neurod1 factors also convert fetal postnatal human fibroblasts cells showing typical neuronal morphologies expressing multiple neuronal markers even downregulation exogenous transcription factors importantly vast majority human cells able generate action potentials many matured receive synaptic contacts co-cultured primary mouse cortical neurons data demonstrate non-neural human somatic cells well pluripotent stem cells can converted directly neurons lineage-determining transcription factors methods may facilitate robust generation patient-specific human neurons vitro disease modelling future applications regenerative medicine
