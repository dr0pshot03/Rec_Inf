nucleotide-dependent single double-headed binding kinesin
motility kinesin motors explained hand-over-hand model two heads kinesin alternately repeat single-headed double-headed binding microtubule investigate binding mode kinesin key nucleotide states adenosine -triphosphate atp hydrolysis measured mechanical properties single kinesin-microtubule complex applying external load optical tweezers unbinding force elastic modulus solutions containing amp-pnp tan atp analog twice value nucleotide-free solution presence amp-pnp adenosine -diphosphate thus kinesin binds two heads former one head latter two states supports major prediction hand-over-hand model
