evolution driven differential dispersal within wild bird population 
evolutionary theory predicts local population divergence will depend balance diversifying effect selection homogenizing effect gene flow- however spatial variation expression genetic variation will also generate differential evolutionary responses furthermore dispersal non-random may actually reinforce rather counteract evolutionary differentiation document evolution differences body mass within population great tits parus major inhabiting single continuous woodland year period show genetic variance nestling body mass spatially variable generates different potential responses selection diversifying effect reinforced non-random dispersal matching patterns variation selection evolution population ecological data argue small-scale differentiation driven density-related differences habitat quality affecting settlement decisions data show gene flow homogeneous evolutionary differentiation can rapid can occur surprisingly small spatial scales findings important implications questions scale adaptation speciation challenge usual treatment dispersal force opposing evolutionary differentiation
