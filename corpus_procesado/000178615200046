probing free-energy surface protein folding single-molecule fluorescence spectroscopy
protein folding inherently heterogeneous process large number microscopic pathways connect myriad unfolded conformations unique conformation native structure first step towards long-range goal describing distribution pathways experimentally forster resonance energy transfer fret measured single freely diffusing molecules- use method determine properties free-energy surface folding obtained ensemble experiments show single-molecule fret measurements small cold-shock protein expose equilibrium collapse unfolded polypeptide allow us calculate limits polypeptide reconfiguration time results limits height free-energy barrier folding obtained consistent simple statistical mechanical model barriers derived simulations using molecular dynamics unlike activation energy free-energy barrier includes activation entropy thus elusive experimental determination kinetic process solution
