regulation cellular heat shock response caenorhabditis elegans thermosensory neurons 
temperature pervasively affects cellular processes response rapid increase temperature cells undergo heat shock response ancient highly conserved program stress inducible gene expression reestablish cellular homeostasis isolated cells heat shock response initiated presence misfolded proteins therefore thought cell autonomous contrast show within metazoan caenorhabditis elegans heat shock response somatic cells cell autonomous rather depends thermosensory neuron afd senses ambient temperature regulates temperature dependent behavior propose model whereby loss cell autonomy serves integrate behavioral metabolic stress related responses establish organismal response environmental change
