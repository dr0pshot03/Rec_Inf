coherent coupling single spin microwave cavity photons
electron spins photons complementary quantum-mechanical objects can used carry manipulate transform quantum information combine resources desirable achieve coherent coupling single spin photons stored superconducting resonator using circuit design based nanoscale spin valve coherently hybridize individual spin charge states double quantum dot preserving spin coherence scheme allows us achieve spin-photon coupling megahertz range single-spin level cooperativity found reach spin coherence time nanoseconds thereby demonstrate mesoscopic device suitable nondestructive spin readout distant spin coupling
