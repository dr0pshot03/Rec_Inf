predicting mutation outcome early stochastic variation genetic interaction partners
many mutations including cause disease detrimental effect subset individuals reasons usually unknown may include additional genetic variation environmental risk factors however phenotypic discordance remains even absence genetic variation example monozygotic twins incomplete penetrance mutations frequent isogenic model organisms homogeneous environments propose model incomplete penetrance based genetic interaction networks using caenorhabditis elegans model system identify two compensation mechanisms vary among individuals influence mutation outcome first feedback induction ancestral gene duplicate differs across individuals high expression masking effects mutation supports hypothesis redundancy maintained genomes buffer stochastic developmental failure second normal embryonic development find substantial variation induction molecular chaperones hsp90 daf- chaperones act promiscuous buffers genetic variation embryos stronger induction hsp90 less likely affected inherited mutation simultaneously quantifying variation two independent responses allows phenotypic outcome mutation accurately predicted individuals model methodology provide framework dissecting causes incomplete penetrance results establish inter-individual variation specific general buffering systems combine determine outcome inherited mutations individual
