temporal patterns human cortical activity reflect tone sequence structure 
despite growing interest temporal aspects auditory neural processing little known large-scale timing patterns brain activity perception auditory sequences partly possible ro distinguish stimulus-related activity endogenous brain signals recorded electrical magnetic sensors use amplitude modulation unfamiliar unfamiliar similar minute-long tone sequences label stimulus-related magnetoencephalographic neural activity human subjects- show temporal patterns activity recorded particular brain regions track pitch contour tone sequences accuracy tracking increasing tone sequences become predictable structure contrast temporal synchronization recording locations particularly sites left posterior hemisphere rest brain greatest sequences melody-like statistical properties may reflect perceptual integration local ant global pitch patterns melody-like sequences method particularly well suited studying temporal neural correlates complex auditory sequences speech music engage multiple brain areas perception unfolds time
