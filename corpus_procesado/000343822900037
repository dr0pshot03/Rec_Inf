detecting topological currents graphene superlattices 
topological materials may exhibit hall-like currents flowing transversely applied electric field even absence magnetic field graphene superlattices broken inversion symmetry topological currents originating graphenes two valleys predicted flow opposite directions combine produce long-range charge neutral flow observed effect nonlocal voltage zero magnetic field narrow energy range near dirac points distances large several micrometers away nominal current path locally topological currents comparable strength applied current indicating large valley-hall angles long-range character topological currents transistor-like control means gate voltage can exploited information processing based valley degrees freedom
