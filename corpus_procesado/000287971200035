layer-by-layer removal graphene device patterning
patterning graphene useful fabricating electronic devices existing methods allow control number layers graphene removed show sputter-coating graphene graphene-like materials zinc dissolving latter dilute acid removes one graphene layer leaves lower layers intact method works four different types graphene graphene-like materials: graphene oxide chemically converted graphene chemical vapor-deposited graphene micromechanically cleaved clear-tape graphene basis data top graphene layer damaged sputtering process acid treatment removes damaged layer carbon used predesigned zinc patterns method can viewed lithography etches sample single-atomic-layer resolution
