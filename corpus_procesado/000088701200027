ultrafast electron localization dynamics following photo-induced charge transfer 
molecular dynamics occurring earliest stages following photo-induced charge transfer investigated femtosecond time-resolved absorption anisotropy measurements [rubpy]+ bpy -bipyridine reveal time dependence nitrile solutions attributed initial delocalization excited state three ligands followed charge localization onto single ligand localization process proposed coupled nondiffusive solvation dynamics contrast measurements sampling population dynamics show spectral evolution associated wave packet motion excited state surface independent solvent results therefore reveal two important contributions evolution charge transfer states condensed phase one strongly coupled surrounding environment another follows potential internal molecule
