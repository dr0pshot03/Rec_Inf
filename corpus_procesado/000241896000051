microtubule-severing activity shigella pivotal intercellular spreading
pathogenic bacteria actually invade cytoplasm target host cells invasive bacteria acquire propulsive force move recruiting actin inducing polymerization show shigella movement within cytoplasm severely hindered microtubules bacteria destroyed surrounding microtubules secreting vira means type iii secretion system degradation microtubules vira dependent alpha tubulin specific cysteine protease like activity vira mutants move within host cytoplasm failed move adjacent cells
