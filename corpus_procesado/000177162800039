fractal geometry predicts varying body size scaling relationships mammal bird home ranges 
scaling laws describe complex interactions organisms environment function body size offer exciting potential synthesis biology1- home range size area used individual organisms critical ecological variable integrates behaviour physiology population density strongly depends organism size5- present new model home range-body size scaling based fractal resource distributions resource encounter rates function body size model predicts universally constant scaling exponent home range defines possible range values set geometric limits resource density distribution model unifies apparently conflicting earlier results explains differences scaling exponents among herbivorous carnivorous mammals birds5- apply model predict home range increases habitat fragmentation home ranges larger species much sensitive habitat fragmentation smaller species
