crystal structure rna-dependent rna polymerase influenza c virus 
negative-sense rna viruses influenza encode large multidomain rna-dependent rna polymerases can transcribe replicate viral rna genome1 influenza virus polymerase flupol composed three polypeptides: pb1 pb2 pa/p3 pb1 houses polymerase active site whereas pb2 pa/p3 contain respectively cap-binding endonuclease domains required transcription initiation cap-snatching2 replication occurs de novo initiation involves complementary rna intermediate currently available structures influenza b virus polymerases include promoter rna termini viral genome segments showing flupol transcription pre-initiation states34 report structure apo-flupol influenza c virus solved x-ray crystallography angstrom revealing new closed conformation apo-flupol forms compact particle pb1 centre capped one face pb2 clamped two globular domains p3 notably structure radically different promoter-bound flupols34 endonudease domain p3 domains within carboxy-terminal two-thirds pb2 completely rearranged cap-binding site occluded pb2 resulting conformation incompatible transcription initiation thus structure captures flupol closed transcription pre-activation state reveals conformation newly made apo-flupol infected cell may also apply flupol context non-transcribing ribonucleoprotein complex comparison apo-flupol structure promoter-bound flupols allows us propose mechanism flupol activation study demonstrates remarkable flexibility influenza virus rna polymerase aids understanding mechanisms controlling transcription genome replication
