magnetic field-induced superconductivity ferromagnet urhge
several metals including urhge superconductivity recently observed appear coexist ferromagnetism temperatures well ferromagnetic state forms however material characteristics leading state coexistence yet fully elucidated report urhge magnetic transition direction spin axis changes magnetic field testa applied parallel crystal b axis also report second pocket superconductivity occurs low temperature range fields enveloping magnetic transition well field testa superconductivity first destroyed findings strongly suggest excitations spins rotate stimulate superconductivity neighborhood quantum phase transition high magnetic field
