rising atmospheric co2 reduces sequestration root-derived soil carbon
forests key role carbon sinks potentially mitigate continuing increase atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration associated climate change show carbon dioxide enrichment although causing short-term growth stimulation range european tree species also leads increase soil microbial respiration marked decline sequestration root-derived carbon soil findings indicate similar processes operate forest ecosystems size annual terrestrial carbon sink may substantially reduced resulting positive feedback rate increase atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration
