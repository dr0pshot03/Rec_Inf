self-propagation pathogenic protein aggregates neurodegenerative diseases 
several decades scientists speculated key understanding age-related neurodegenerative disorders may found unusual biology prion diseases recently owing largely advent new disease models hypothesis gained experimental momentum remarkable variety diseases specific proteins found misfold aggregate seeds structurally corrupt like proteins causing aggregate form pathogenic assemblies ranging small oligomers large masses amyloid proteinaceous seeds can therefore serve self-propagating agents instigation progression disease alzheimers disease cerebral proteopathies seem arise de novo misfolding sustained corruption endogenous proteins whereas prion diseases can also infectious origin however outcome cases functional compromise nervous system aggregated proteins gain toxic function and/or lose normal function unifying pathogenic principle prion paradigm suggests broadly relevant therapeutic directions large class currently intractable diseases
