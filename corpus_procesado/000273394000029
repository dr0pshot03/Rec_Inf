energy-conversion properties vapor-liquid-solid-grown silicon wire-array photocathodes 
silicon wire arrays though attractive materials use photovoltaics photocathodes hydrogen generation date exhibited poor performance using copper-catalyzed vapor-liquid-solid-growth process sicl bcl used grow ordered arrays crystalline p-type silicon p-si microwires p+-si substrates wire arrays used photocathodes contact aqueous methyl viologen+/+ electrolyte energy-conversion efficiencies % observed monochromatic nanometer light fluxes comparable solar illumination despite external quantum yield short circuit internal quantum yields least demonstrating measured photocurrents limited light absorption wire arrays filled % incident optical plane test devices inherent performance wires thus conceptually allows development efficient photovoltaic photoelectrochemical energy-conversion devices based radial junction platform
