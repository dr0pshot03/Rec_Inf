species interactions can explain taylors power law ecological time series
one generalities ecology taylors power law- describes species-specific relationship temporal spatial variance populations mean abundances populations experiencing constant per capita environmental variability regression log variance versus log mean abundance gives line slope despite expectation species slopes less refs indicating abundant populations species relatively less variable expected basis simple statistical grounds causes abundant populations less variable received considerable attention- explanation generality pattern still lacking suggest novel explanation scaling temporal variability population abundances using stochastic simulation analytical models demonstrate negative interactions among species community can produce slopes taylors power law less like observed real data sets result provides example population dynamics single species can understood context interactions within ecological community
