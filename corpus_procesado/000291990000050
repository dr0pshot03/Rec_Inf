sleep synaptic homeostasis: structural evidence drosophila 
functions sleep remain elusive strong link exists sleep need neuronal plasticity tested hypothesis plastic processes wake lead net increase synaptic strength sleep necessary synaptic renormalization found three drosophila neuronal circuits synapse size number increases hours wake decreases flies allowed sleep richer wake experience resulted larger synaptic growth greater sleep need finally demonstrate gene fmr1 fragile x mental retardation plays important role sleep-dependent synaptic renormalization
