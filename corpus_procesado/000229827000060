fungal pathogen reduces potential malaria transmission 
using rodent malaria model found exposure surfaces treated fungal entornopathogens following infectious blood meal reduced number mosquitoes able transmit malaria factor fungal infection achieved contact solid surfaces netting durations well within typical post-feed resting periods sufficient cause >% mortality daily mortality rates escalated dramatically around time sporozoite maturation infected mosquitoes showed reduced propensity blood feed residual sprays fungal biopesticides might replace supplement chemical insecticides malaria control particularly areas high insecticide resistance
