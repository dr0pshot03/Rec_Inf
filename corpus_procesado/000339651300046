digit patterning controlled bmp-sox9-wnt turing network modulated morphogen gradients
limb development digits emerge undifferentiated mesenchymal tissue constitutes limb bud proposed process controlled self-organizing turing mechanism whereby diffusible molecules interact produce periodic pattern digital interdigital fates however identities molecules remain unknown combining experiments modeling reveal evidence turing network implemented bmp sox9 wnt drives digit specification develop realistic two-dimensional simulation digit patterning show network modulated morphogen gradients recapitulates expression patterns sox9 wild type perturbation experiments systems biology approach reveals combination growth morphogen gradients self-organizing turing network can achieve robust reproducible pattern formation
