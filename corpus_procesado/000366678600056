neutrophils support lung colonization metastasis-initiating breast cancer cells 
despite progress development drugs efficiently target cancer cells treatments metastatic tumours often ineffective now well-established dependency cancer cells microenvironment1 suggests targeting non-cancer-cell component tumour might form basis development novel therapeutic approaches however as-yet poorly characterized contribution host responses tumour growth metastatic progression represents limitation exploiting approach identify neutrophils main component driver metastatic establishment within pre- metastatic lung microenvironment mouse breast cancer models neutrophils fundamental role inflammatory responses contribution tumorigenesis still controversial2- using various strategies block neutrophil recruitment pre-metastatic site demonstrate neutrophils specifically support metastatic initiation importantly find neutrophil-derived leukotrienes aid colonization distant tissues selectively expanding sub-pool cancer cells retain high tumorigenic potential genetic pharmacological inhibition leukotriene-generating enzyme arachidonate -lipoxygenase alox5 abrogates neutrophil pro-metastatic activity consequently reduces metastasis results reveal efficacy using targeted therapy specific tumour microenvironment component indicate neutrophil alox5 inhibition may limit metastatic progression
