drosophila dosage compensation involves enhanced pol ii recruitment male x-linked promoters 
hyperacetylation histone h4 lysine h4k16 male-specific lethal msl complex drosophila approximately doubles transcription single male x chromosome order match x-linked expression females expression diploid autosomes obtaining accurate measurements rna polymerase ii pol ii occupancies short promoter-proximal rna production detected consistent genome-scale increase pol ii activity promoters male x-linked genes moreover found enhanced pol ii recruitment male x-linked promoters largely dependent msl complex observations provide insights global modulation chromatin structure histone acetylation contributes precise control pol ii function
