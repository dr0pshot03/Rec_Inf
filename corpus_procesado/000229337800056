vascular respiratory uncoupling increases blood pressure atherosclerosis 
observations atherosclerosis often occurs nonsmokers without elevated levels low-density lipoprotein cholesterol atherosclerosis loci far identified mice affect systemic risk factors associated atherosclerosis suggest as-yet-unidentified mechanisms must contribute vascular disease arterial walls undergo regional disturbances metabolism include uncoupling respiration oxidative phosphorylation process occurs extent cells may characteristic blood vessels predisposed development atherosclerosis test hypothesis inefficient metabolism blood vessels promotes vascular disease generated mice doxycycline-inducible expression uncoupling protein ucp1 artery wall show ucp1 expression aortic smooth muscle cells causes hypertension increases dietary atherosclerosis without affecting cholesterol levels ucp1 expression also increases superoxide production decreases availability nitric oxide evidence oxidative stress results provide proof principle inefficient metabolism blood vessels can cause vascular disease
