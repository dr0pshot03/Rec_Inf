small-scale mantle convection produces stratigraphic sequences sedimentary basins
cyclic sedimentary deposits link stratigraphic sequences now geographically distant part depositional environment sequences occur periods million years eustatic sea-level variations regional tectonic events likely causes formation using numerical modeling demonstrate small-scale mantle convection can also cause development stratigraphic sequences recurrent local regional vertical surface movements small-scale convection-driven stratigraphic sequences occur periods million years correlate distances hundred kilometers results suggest previous sequence stratigraphic analyses may contain erroneous conclusions regarding eustatic sea-level variations
