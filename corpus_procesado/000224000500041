frequency-dependent switch inhibition excitation hippocampal unitary circuit 
hippocampus brain structure essential memory cognition classically represented trisynaptic excitatory circuit recent findings challenge view particularly regard mossy fibre input ca3 second synapse trisynaptic pathway1 thus powerful mossy fibre input ca3 pyramidal cells might mediate synaptic excitation inhibition23 show recording connected cell pairs rat entorhinal hippocampal slice cultures single action potentials dentate granule cell evoke net inhibitory signal pyramidal cell hyperpolarization due disynaptic feedforward inhibition overwhelms monosynaptic excitation interestingly net inhibitory synaptic response changes excitatory signal frequency presynaptic action potentials increases process responsible switch involves facilitation monosynaptic excitatory transmission coupled rapid depression inhibitory circuits ability immediately switch polarity synaptic responses constitutes novel synaptic mechanism might crucial state-dependent processing information associative hippocampal networks
