trapped-ion antennae transmission quantum information 
years ago hertz succeeded transmitting signals metres receiving antenna using electromagnetic oscillator thus proving electromagnetic theory developed maxwell since seminal work technology developed various oscillators now available quantum mechanical level quantized electromagnetic oscillations atoms cavities can used couple electric fields however quantum mechanical link two mechanical oscillators cantilevers vibrational modes trapped atoms ions rarely demonstrated achieved indirectly examples include mechanical transport atoms carrying quantum information use spontaneously emitted photons achieve direct coupling motional dipoles separately trapped ions distance micrometres using dipole-dipole interaction quantum mechanical transmission line interaction small single trapped ions coupling amplified using additional trapped ions antennae three ions well interaction increased factor seven compared single-ion case enhancement facilitates bridging larger distances relaxes constraints miniaturization trap electrodes system provides building block quantum computers opportunities coupling different types quantum systems
