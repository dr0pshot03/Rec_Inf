phosphatidylserine receptor required clearance apoptotic cells
cells undergoing apoptosis development removed phagocytes underlying mechanisms process fully understood phagocytes lacking phosphatidylserine receptor psr defective removing apoptotic cells consequently psr-deficient mice dead cells accumulated lung brain causing abnormal development leading neonatal lethality fraction psr knockout mice manifested hyperplasic brain phenotype resembling mice deficient cell death associated genes encoding apaf- caspase- caspase- suggests phagocytes may also involved promoting apoptosis data demonstrate critical role psr early stages mammalian organogenesis suggest receptor may involved respiratory distress syndromes congenital brain malformations
