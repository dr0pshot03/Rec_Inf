regulation gamma delta versus alpha beta t lymphocyte differentiation transcription factor sox13 
alpha beta gamma delta t cells originate common multipotential precursor population thymus molecular mechanisms regulating lineage-fate decision unknown identified sox13 gamma delta-specific gene immune system using sox13 transgenic mice showed transcription factor promotes gd t cell development opposing ab t cell differentiation conversely mice deficient sox13 expression exhibited impaired development gd t cells ab t cells one mechanism sox13 function inhibition signaling developmentally important wnt/t cell factor tcf pathway data thus reveal dominant pathway regulating developmental fate two lineages t lymphocytes
