hidden mass large spatial extent post-starburst galaxy outflow
outflowing winds multiphase plasma proposed regulate buildup galaxies key aspects outflows probed observations using ultraviolet absorption spectroscopy show warm-hot plasma kelvin contains times mass cold gas post-starburst galaxy wind wind extends distances > kiloparsecs least portion will escape moreover kinematical correlation cold warm-hot phases indicates warm-hot plasma related interaction cold matter hotter unseen phase >> kelvin multiphase winds can remove substantial masses alter evolution post-starburst galaxies
