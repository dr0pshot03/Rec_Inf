molecular basis rna-dependent rna polymerase ii activity
rna polymerase pol ii catalyses dna-dependent rna synthesis gene transcription however evidence pol ii also possesses rna-dependent rna polymerase rdrp activity pol ii can use homopolymeric rna template can extend rna several nucleotides absence dna implicated replication rna genomes hepatitis delta virus hdv plant viroids show intrinsic rdrp activity pol ii pure polymerase rna template-product scaffold nucleoside triphosphates ntps crystallography reveals template-product duplex site occupied dna-rna hybrid transcription rdrp activity resides active site used transcription slower less processive dna-dependent activity rdrp activity also obtained part hdv antigenome complex transcription factor iis tfiis pol ii can cleave one hdv strand create reactive stem-loop hybrid site extend new rna end short rna stem-loops extension suffice activity growth critical length apparently impairs processivity rdrp activity pol ii provides missing link molecular evolution suggests pol ii evolved ancient replicase duplicated rna genomes
