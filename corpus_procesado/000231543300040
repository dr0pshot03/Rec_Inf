carbon flux growth mature deciduous forest trees exposed elevated co2 
whether rising atmospheric carbon dioxide co concentrations will cause forests grow faster store carbon open question using free air co2 release combination canopy crane found immediate sustained enhancement carbon flux -meter-tall temperate forest trees exposed elevated co2 however overall stimulation stem growth leaf titter production years photosynthetic capacity reduced leaf chemistry changes minor tree species differed responses although growing vigorously trees accrete biomass carbon stems response elevated co2 thus challenging projections growth responses derived tests smaller trees
