genetics ecological divergence speciation 
ecological differences often evolve early speciation divergent natural selection drives adaptation distinct ecological niches leading ultimately reproductive isolation although process major generator biodiversity genetic basis still poorly understood investigate genetic architecture niche differentiation sympatric species pair threespine stickleback fish mapping environment-dependent effects phenotypic traits hybrid feeding performance semi-natural conditions show multiple unlinked loci act largely additively determine position along major niche axis separating recently diverged species also find functional mismatch phenotypic traits reduces growth stickleback hybrids beyond expected intermediate phenotype suggesting role epistasis underlying genes functional mismatch might lead hybrid incompatibilities analogous underlying intrinsic reproductive isolation depend ecological context
