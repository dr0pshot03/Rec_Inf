radio emission ultraluminous x-ray source
physical nature ultraluminous x-ray sources uncertain stellar-mass black holes beamed radiation intermediate black holes isotropic radiation two plausible explanations discovered radio emission ultraluminous x-ray source dwarf irregular galaxy ngc x-ray radio optical fluxes well x-ray spectral shape consistent beamed relativistic jet emission accreting stellar black hole confirmed suggest ultraluminous x-ray sources may stellar-mass rather intermediate-mass black holes however interpretation source jet-producing intermediate-mass black hole ruled time
