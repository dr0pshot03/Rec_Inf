two-pore channels control ebola virus host cell entry drug targets disease treatment
ebola virus causes sporadic outbreaks lethal hemorrhagic fever humans currently approved therapy cells take ebola virus macropinocytosis followed trafficking endosomal vesicles however factors controlling endosomal virus movement known find ebola virus entry host cells requires endosomal calcium channels called two-pore channels tpcs disrupting tpc function gene knockout small interfering rnas small-molecule inhibitors halted virus trafficking prevented infection tetrandrine potent small molecule tested inhibited infection human macrophages primary target ebola virus vivo also showed therapeutic efficacy mice therefore tpc proteins play key role ebola virus infection may effective targets antiviral therapy
