cellular function rna-interference enzyme dicer maturation let small temporal rna
nucleotide small temporal rna strna let regulates developmental timing caenorhabditis elegans probably bilateral animals present vivo vitro evidence drosophila melanogaster developmentally regulated precursor rna cleaved rna interference-like mechanism produce mature let strna targeted destruction cultured human cells messenger rna encoding enzyme dicer acts rna interference pathway leads accumulation let precursor thus rna interference strna pathways intersect pathways require rna-processing enzyme dicer produce active small-rna component represses gene expression
