reinventing germanium avalanche photodetector nanophotonic on-chip optical interconnects
integration optical communication circuits directly high-performance microprocessor chips can enable extremely powerful computer systems germanium photodetector can monolithically integrated silicon transistor technology- viewed key element connecting chip components infrared optical signals device capability detect very-low-power optical signals high speed although germanium avalanche photodetectors apd using charge amplification close avalanche breakdown can achieve high gain thus detect low-power optical signals universally considered suffer intolerably high amplification noise characteristic germanium high gain low excess noise demonstrated using germanium layer detection light signals amplification taking place separate silicon layer however relatively thick semiconductor layers required structures limit apd speeds 10ghz require excessively high bias voltages around 25v ref show nanophotonic nanoelectronic engineering aimed shaping optical electrical fields nanometre scale within germanium amplification layer can overcome otherwise intrinsically poor noise characteristics achieving dramatic reduction amplification noise per cent generating strongly non-uniform electric fields region impact ionization germanium reduced just 30nm allowing device benefit noise reduction effects- arise small distances furthermore smallness apds means bias voltage 5v required achieve avalanche gain 10db operational speeds exceeding 30ghz monolithic integration device computer chips might enable applications beyond computer optical interconnects-in telecommunications secure quantum key distribution subthreshold ultralow-power transistors
