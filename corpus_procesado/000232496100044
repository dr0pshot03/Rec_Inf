unanticipated involvement several intraflagellar transport proteins mammalian hedgehog hh pathway hinted functional connection cilia hh signal transduction show mammalian smoothened smo seven-transmembrane protein essential hh signalling expressed primary cilium ciliary expression regulated hh pathway activity sonic hedgehog activating mutations smo promote ciliary localization whereas smo antagonist cyclopamine inhibits ciliary localization translocation smo primary cilia depends upon conserved hydrophobic basic residue sequence homologous domain previously shown required ciliary localization seven-transmembrane proteins caenorhabditis elegans mutation domain prevents ciliary localization also eliminates smo activity cultured cells zebrafish embryos thus hh-dependent translocation cilia essential smo activity suggesting smo acts primary cilium
