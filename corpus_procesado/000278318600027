dynamic kinetic resolution biaryl atropisomers via peptide-catalyzed asymmetric bromination
despite widespread use axially chiral atropisomeric biaryl ligands modern synthesis occurrence numerous natural products exhibiting axial chirality catalytic methods emerged direct asymmetric preparation compound class present tripeptide-derived small-molecule catalyst dynamic kinetic resolution racemic biaryl substrates reaction proceeds via atropisomer-selective electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction using simple bromination reagents result enantioselective synthesis delivers chiral nonracemic biaryl compounds excellent optical purity good isolated chemical yields cases >: enantiomer ratio isolated yields % mechanistic model advanced accounts basis selectivity observed
