saccharomyces cerevisiae atm orthologue suppresses break-induced chromosome translocations 
chromosome translocations frequently associated many types blood-related cancers childhood sarcomas detection chromosome translocations assists diagnosis treatment prognosis diseases1; however despite importance diseases molecular mechanisms leading chromosome translocations well understood available evidence indicates role non-homologous end joining nhej dna double-strand breaks dsbs origin1- develop yeast-based system induces reciprocal chromosome translocation formation ligation breaks two different chromosomes show interchromosomal end joining efficiently suppressed tel1 mre11-rad50-xrs2-dependent pathway; distinct role tel1 telomeric integrity mec1 tel1 dependent checkpoint controls suppression dsb-induced chromosome translocations depends kinase activity tel1 dun1 damage-induced phosphorylation sae2 histone h2ax proteins tel1 sae2-dependent tethering promotion degradation broken chromosome ends discourage error-prone nhej interchromosomal nhej preserving chromosome integrity dna damage results indicate like human atm tel1 serves key regulator chromosome integrity pathway reduces risk dsb-induced chromosome translocations probably pertinent oncogenic chromosome translocations atm-deficient cells
