separate neural systems value immediate delayed monetary rewards
humans offered choice rewards available different points time relative values options discounted according expected delays delivery using functional magnetic resonance imaging examined neural correlates time discounting subjects made series choices monetary reward options varied delay delivery demonstrate two separate systems involved decisions parts limbic system associated midbrain dopamine system including paralimbic cortex preferentially activated decisions involving immediately available rewards contrast regions lateral prefrontal cortex posterior parietal cortex engaged uniformly intertemporal choices irrespective delay furthermore relative engagement two systems directly associated subjects choices greater relative fronto-parietal activity subjects choose longer term options
