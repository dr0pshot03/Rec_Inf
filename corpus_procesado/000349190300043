mammalian polymerase theta promotes alternative nhej suppresses recombination 
alternative non-homologous end-joining nhej machinery facilitates several genomic rearrangements can lead cellular transformation error-prone repair pathway triggered upon telomere de-protection promote formation deleterious chromosome end-to-end fusions1- using next-generation sequencing technology show repair alternative nhej yields non-ttaggg nucleotide insertions fusion breakpoints dysfunctional telomeres investigating enzymatic activity responsible random insertions enabled us identify polymerase theta pol theta; encoded polq mice crucial alternative nhej factor mammalian cells polq inhibition suppresses alternative nhej dysfunctional telomeres hinders chromosomal translocations non-telomeric loci addition found loss polq mice results increased rates homology-directed repair evident recombination dysfunctional telomeres accumulation rad51 double-stranded breaks lastly show depletion pol theta synergistic effect cell survival absence brca genes suggesting inhibition mutagenic polymerase represents valid therapeutic avenue tumours carrying mutations homology-directed repair genes
