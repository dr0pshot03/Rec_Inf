unexpected strain-stiffening crystalline solids 
strain-stiffening-an increase material stiffness large strains-is vital mechanism many soft biological materials thwart excessive deformation protect tissue integrity1- understanding fundamental science strain-stiffening incorporating concept design metals ceramics advanced applications attractive prospect using cementite fe3c aluminium borocarbide al3bc3 prototypes show via quantum-mechanical calculations strain-stiffening also occurs surprisingly simple inorganic crystalline solids confers exceptionally high strengths two solids anomalously low resistance deformation near equilibrium fe3c al3bc3 ideal shear strength shear modulus ratios attain remarkably high values along [ ] [ bar0] slip systems respectively values seven times larger original frenkel value / pi refs highest yet reported crystalline solids extraordinary stiffening fe3c arises strain-induced reversible cross-linking weakly coupled edge corner-sharing fe6c slabs new bond formation creates strong three-dimensional covalent bond network resists large shear deformation unlike fe3c new bond forms al3bc3 stiffening still occurs strong repulsion al b compressed al-b bond unsettles existing covalent bond network discoveries challenge conventional wisdom large shear modulus reliable predictor hardness strength materials4- provide new lessons materials selection design
