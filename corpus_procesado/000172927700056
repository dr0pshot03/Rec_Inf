centromeres heterochromatic many organisms mitotic function silent chromatin remains unknown cell division newly replicated sister chromatids must cohere anaphase scc1/rad21-mediated cohesion destroyed metazoans chromosome arm cohesins dissociate prophase leaving centromeres linkage anaphase known distinguishes centromere cohesion arm cohesion fission yeast swi6 heterochromatin protein counterpart component si[ent heterochromatin show heterochromatin specifically required cohesion sister centromeres swi6 required association rad21-cohesin centromeres along chromosome arms thus acts distinguish centromere arm cohesion therefore one function centromeric heterochromatin attract cohesin thereby ensuring sister centromere cohesion proper chromosome segregation
