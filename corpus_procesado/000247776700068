yeast dna polymerase epsilon participates leading-strand dna replication
multiple dna polymerases participate replicating leading lagging strands eukaryotic nuclear genome although years passed since first dna polymerase discovered identity major polymerase used leading-strand replication uncertain constructed derivative yeast dna polymerase e retains high replication activity strongly reduced replication fidelity particularly thymine-deoxythymidine -monophosphate t-dtmp adenine-deoxyadenosine -monophosphate a-damp mismatches yeast strains dna polymerase e allele elevated rates t substitution mutations position rate substitutions depend orientation mutational reporter location relative origins dna replication reveal pattern indicating dna polymerase e participates leading-strand dna replication
