selective information routing ventral hippocampal ca1 projection neurons 
hippocampus computes diverse information involving spatial memory anxiety reward directly projects several brain areas different computations transmitted downstream targets uniformly hippocampus selectively route information according content target region recording ventral hippocampal ca1 neurons rats different behavioral tasks determining axonal projections optogenetics observed subsets neurons changing firing places elevated anxiety changing activity goal approach anxiety-related firing selectively increased neurons projecting prefrontal cortex goal-directed firing prominent neurons targeting nucleus accumbens; triple-projecting neurons targeting prefrontal cortex amygdala nucleus accumbens active tasks sharp wave/ripples thus hippocampal neurons route distinct behavior-contingent information selectively different target areas
