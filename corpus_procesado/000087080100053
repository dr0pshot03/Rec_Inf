fringe forms complex notch 
fringe protein drosophila vertebrate homologues function boundary determination pattern formation- fringe proposed inhibit serrate-notch signalling potentiate delta-notch signalling show fringe notch form complex lin-notch repeats epidermal growth factor repeats egf22- notch co-expressed abruptex59b ax59b axm1 mutations caused missense mutations egf repeats respectively abolish fringe-notch interaction egf22- whereas ln-b mutation third lin-notch repeat notch abolishes interaction lin-notch repeats ax mutations also greatly affect notch response ectopic fringe vivo results vitro protein mixing experiments subcellular colocalization experiments indicate fringe-notch complex may form secretion findings explain fringe acts cell-autonomously modulate ligand preference notch fringe-notch relationship conserved phyla development diverse structures
