neurophysiological investigation basis fmri signal
functional magnetic resonance imaging fmri widely used study operational organization human brain exact relationship measured fmri signal underlying neural activity unclear present simultaneous intracortical recordings neural signals fmri responses compared local field potentials lfps single multi-unit spiking activity highly spatio-temporally resolved blood-oxygen-level-dependent bold fmri responses visual cortex monkeys largest magnitude changes observed lfps recording sites characterized transient responses signal significantly correlated haemodynamic response linear systems analysis trial-by-trial basis showed impulse response neurovascular system animal site-specific lfps yield better estimate bold responses multi-unit responses findings suggest bold contrast mechanism reflects input intracortical processing given area rather spiking output
