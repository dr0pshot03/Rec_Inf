ankyrin-g promotes cyclic nucleotide-gated channel transport rod photoreceptor sensory cilia
cyclic nucleotide-gated cng channels localize exclusively plasma membrane photosensitive outer segments rod photoreceptors generate electrical response light report finding targeting cng channels rod outer segment required interaction ankyrin-g ankyrin-g localized exclusively rod outer segments coimmunoprecipitated cng channel bound c-terminal domain channel beta subunit ankyrin-g depletion neonatal mouse retinas markedly reduced cng channel expression transgenic expression cng channel beta-subunit mutants xenopus rods showed ankyrin-g binding necessary sufficient targeting beta subunit outer segments thus ankyrin-g required transport cng channels plasma membrane rod outer segments
