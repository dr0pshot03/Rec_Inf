subcellular organization neocortical excitatory connections
understanding cortical circuits will require mapping connections specific populations neurons well determining dendritic locations synapses occur dendrites individual cortical neurons overlap numerous types local long-range excitatory axons axodendritic overlap always good predictor actual connection strength- developed efficient channelrhodopsin chr2-assisted method- map spatial distribution synaptic inputs defined presynaptic chr2 expression within dendritic arborizations recorded neurons expressed chr2 two thalamic nuclei whisker motor cortex local excitatory neurons mapped synapses pyramidal neurons layers 5a 5b l3 l5a l5b mouse barrel cortex within dendritic arborizations l3 cells individual inputs impinged onto distinct single domains domains arrayed orderly monotonic pattern along apical axis: axons central origins targeted progressively higher regions apical dendrites l5 arborizations different inputs targeted separate basal apical domains input l3 l5 dendrites l1 related whisker movement position suggesting signals role controlling gain target neurons experiments reveal high specificity subcellular organization excitatory circuits
