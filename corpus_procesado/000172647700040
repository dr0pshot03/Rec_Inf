cell proliferation without neurogenesis adult primate neocortex 
recent assertion new neurons continually added neocortex adult macaque monkeys profound implications understanding cellular mechanisms higher cognitive functions searched neurogenesis adult macaques using immunofluorescent triple labeling dna-replication indicator bromodeoxyuridine brdu neuronal glial cell markers although numerous brdu-labeled cells distributed throughout cerebral wall including neocortex identified non-neuronal cells evidence newly generated neurons limited hippocampus olfactory bulb thus results substantiate claim neurogenesis normal adult primate neocortex
