laser-induced selectivity dimerization versus polymerization butadiene pressure 
pressure-induced chemical reaction liquid butadiene studied fourier transform infrared spectroscopy diamond anvil cell dimerization found occur gigapascal giving vinylcyclohexene according cyclo-addiction reaction trace amount polybutadiene forms irradiating high-pressure sample milliwatts -nanometer argon+ laser line dimerization completely inhibited rapid formation pure transpolybutadiene observed use different excitation wavelength allows us emphasize selectivity process identify active role 21ag state pressure laser-induced chemical reaction
