control segment number vertebrate embryos 
vertebrate body axis subdivided repeated segments best exemplified vertebrae derive embryonic somites number somites precisely defined given species varies widely one species another determine mechanism controlling somite number compared somitogenesis zebrafish chicken mouse corn snake embryos present evidence species similar clock-and-wavefront- mechanism operates control somitogenesis somitogenesis brought end process presomitic mesoderm first increased size gradually shrinks exhausted terminating somite formation snake embryos however segmentation clock rate much faster relative developmental rate amniotes leading greatly increased number smaller-sized somites
