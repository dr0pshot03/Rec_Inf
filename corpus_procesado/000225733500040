natural engineered nucleic acids tools explore biology
rna dna molecules can form complex three-dimensional folded structures surprisingly sophisticated functions including catalysing chemical reactions controlling gene expression although natural nucleic acids make occasional use advanced functions true potential sophisticated function biological polymers far greater important challenge biochemists take rna dna beyond proven use polymers form double-helical structures molecular engineers beginning harness power nucleic acids form complex three-dimensional structures apply tools exploring biological systems therapeutics
