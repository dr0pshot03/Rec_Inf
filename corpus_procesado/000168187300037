quantum adiabatic evolution algorithm applied random instances np-complete problem
quantum system will stay near instantaneous ground state hamiltonian governs evolution varies slowly enough quantum adiabatic behavior basis new class algorithms quantum computing tested one algorithm applying randomly generated hard instances np-complete problem small examples simulate quantum adiabatic algorithm worked well providing evidence quantum computers large ones can built may able outperform ordinary computers hard sets instances np-complete problems
