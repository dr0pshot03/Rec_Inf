transient aurora jupiter injections magnetospheric electrons 
energetic electrons ions trapped earths magnetosphere can suddenly accelerated towards planet1- dynamic features earths aurora northern southern lights created fraction injected particles travels along magnetic field lines hits upper atmosphere4 jupiters aurora appears similar earths respects; appear large ovals circling poles show transient events6- magnetospheres jupiter earth different-particularly way powered-that known whether magnetospheric drivers12 earths aurora also cause jupiter show direct relationship earth-like injections electrons jupiters magnetosphere transient auroral feature jupiters polar region relationship remarkably similar happens earth therefore suggests despite large differences planetary magnetospheres processes generate aurorae throughout solar system
