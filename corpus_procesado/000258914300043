identification active gold nanoclusters iron oxide supports co oxidation
gold nanocrystals absorbed metal oxides exceptional properties oxidation catalysis including oxidation carbon monoxide ambient temperatures identification active catalytic gold species among many present real catalysts challenging used aberration corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy analyze several iron oxide supported catalyst samples ranging little activity others high activities high catalytic activity carbon monoxide oxidation correlated presence bilayer clusters similar nanometer diameter contain similar gold atoms activity bilayer clusters consistent demonstrated previously use model catalyst systems
