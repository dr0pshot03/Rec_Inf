preparation polydiiododiacetylene ordered conjugated polymer carbon iodine
conjugated organic polymers generally must include large substituents stability either contained within appended polymer chain polydiacetylenes substituents fulfill another important role: topochemical polymerization control spacing diyne monomers produce ordered polymer using co-crystal scaffolding prepared poly diiododiacetylene pida nearly unadorned carbon chain substituted single-atom iodine side groups monomer diiodobutadiyne forms co-crystals bis nitrile oxalamides aligned hydrogen bonds oxalamide groups weak lewis acid-base interactions nitriles iodoalkynes co-crystals one oxalamide host diyne undergoes spontaneous topochemical polymerization form pida structure dark blue crystals look copper-colored reflected light confirmed single-crystal x-ray diffraction ultraviolet-visible absorption spectroscopy scanning electron microscopy
