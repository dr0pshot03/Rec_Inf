nonstoichiometric dislocation cores alpha-alumina 
little known dislocation core structures oxides despite central importance controlling electrical optical mechanical properties often assumed basis charge considerations nonstoichiometric core structure exist report atomic-resolution images directly resolve cation anion sublattices alumina alpha-al2o3 dissociated basal edge dislocation seen consist two cores aluminum column terminates one partial oxygen column terminates second partial partial core locally nonstoichiometric due excess aluminum oxygen core implication mechanical properties mobile high-temperature dislocation core structure consists two closely spaced partial dislocations basal slip occur synchronized motion partials adjacent planes required
