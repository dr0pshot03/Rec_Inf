genome sequence schizosaccharomyces pombe 
sequenced annotated genome fission yeast schizosaccharomyces pombe contains smallest number protein-coding genes yet recorded eukaryote: centromeres kilobases kb contain related repeats including highly conserved -kb element regions upstream genes longer budding yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae possibly reflecting more-extended control regions % genes contain introns fifty genes significant similarity human disease genes half cancer related identify highly conserved genes important eukaryotic cell organization including required cytoskeleton compartmentation cell-cycle control proteolysis protein phosphorylation rna splicing genes may originated appearance eukaryotic life similarly conserved genes important multicellular organization identified suggesting transition prokaryotes eukaryotes required new genes transition unicellular multicellular organization
