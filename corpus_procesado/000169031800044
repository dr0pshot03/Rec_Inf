sorting mannose phosphate receptors mediated ggas
delivery soluble hydrolases lysosomes mediated cation-independent cation-dependent mannose phosphate receptors cytosolic tails receptors contain acidic-cluster-dileucine signals direct sorting trans-golgi network endosomal-lysosomal system found signals bind vhs domain golgi-localized gamma ear-containing arf-binding proteins ggas receptors ggas left trans-golgi network tubulo-vesicular carriers dominant-negative gga mutant blocked exit receptors trans-golgi network thus ggas appear mediate sorting mannose phosphate receptors trans-golgi network
