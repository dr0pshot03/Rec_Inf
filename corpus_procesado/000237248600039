small-molecule screen c-elegans yields new calcium channel antagonist
small-molecule inhibitors protein function powerful tools biological analysis can lead development new drugs however major bottleneck generating useful small-molecule tools target identification show caenorhabditis elegans can provide platform discovery new bioactive compounds target identification screened small molecules bioactivity wild-type worms identified compounds induce variety phenotypes one compound named nemadipine-a induces marked defects morphology egg-laying nemadipine-a resembles class widely prescribed anti-hypertension drugs called -dihydropyridines dhps antagonize alpha-subunit l-type calcium channels genetic suppressor screen identified egl sole candidate target nemadipine-a conclusion supported several additional lines evidence egl encodes l-type calcium channel alpha-subunit c elegans genome show nemadipine-a can also antagonize vertebrate l-type calcium channels demonstrating worms vertebrates share orthologous protein target conversely fda-approved dhps fail elicit robust phenotypes making nemadipine-a unique tool screen genetic interactions important class drugs finally demonstrate utility nemadipine using reveal redundancy among three calcium channels egg-laying circuit study demonstrates c elegans enables rapid identification new small-molecule tools targets
