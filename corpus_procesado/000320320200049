subangstrom resolution x-ray structure details aquaporin-water interactions
aquaporins membrane channels facilitate flow water across biological membranes two conserved regions central selective function: dual asparagine-proline-alanine npa aquaporin signature motif aromatic arginine selectivity filter sf present crystal structure yeast aquaporin angstrom resolution visualize h-bond donor interactions npa motifs asparagine residues passing water molecules observe polarized water-water h-bond configuration within channel assign tautomeric states sf histidine arginine residues observe four sf water positions closely spaced simultaneously occupied strongly correlated movements break connectivity sf waters water molecules within channel prevent proton transport via grotthuss mechanism
