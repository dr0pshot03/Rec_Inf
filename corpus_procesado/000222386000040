adaptive radiation resource competition digital organisms 
species richness often peaks intermediate productivity decreases resources become less abundant mechanisms produce pattern completely known several previous studies suggested environmental heterogeneity cause experiments evolving digital organisms populations fixed size maximum species richness emerges intermediate productivity even spatially homogeneous environment owing frequency-dependent selection exploit influx mixed resources diverse pool limiting resources sufficient cause adaptive radiation manifest origin maintenance phenotypically phylogenetically distinct groups organisms
