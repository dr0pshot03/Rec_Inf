aneuploidy confers quantitative proteome changes phenotypic variation budding yeast
aneuploidy referring genome contents characterized abnormal numbers chromosomes associated developmental defects cancer adaptive evolution experimental organisms- however remains unresolved aneuploidy impacts gene expression whether aneuploidy directly bring phenotypic variation improved fitness euploid counterparts show using quantitative mass spectrometry-based proteomics phenotypic profiling levels protein expression aneuploid yeast strains largely scale chromosome copy numbers following trend observed transcriptome aneuploidy confers diverse phenotypes designed novel scheme generate random meiotic segregation stable fully isogenic aneuploid yeast strains distinct karyotypes genome contents 1n 3n without involving genetic selection quantitative growth assays various conditions presence panel chemotherapeutic antifungal drugs found aneuploid strains grew significantly better euploid control strains conditions suboptimal latter results provide strong evidence aneuploidy directly affects gene expression transcriptome proteome levels can generate significant phenotypic variation bring fitness gains diverse conditions findings suggest fitness ranking euploid aneuploid cells dependent context karyotype providing basis notion aneuploidy can directly underlie phenotypic evolution cellular adaptation
