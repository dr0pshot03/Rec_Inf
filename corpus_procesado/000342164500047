critical time window dopamine actions structural plasticity dendritic spines
animal behaviors reinforced subsequent rewards following within narrow time window reward signals primarily coded dopamine modulates synaptic connections medium spiny neurons striatum mechanisms narrow timing detection however remain unknown optically stimulated dopaminergic glutamatergic inputs separately found dopamine promoted spine enlargement narrow time window seconds glutamatergic inputs temporal contingency detected rapid regulation adenosine -cyclic monophosphate thin distal dendrites protein-kinase activated within time window high phosphodiesterase activity thus describe molecular basis reinforcement plasticity level single dendritic spines
