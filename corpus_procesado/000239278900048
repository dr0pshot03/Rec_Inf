molecular architecture axonemal microtubule doublets revealed cryo-electron tomography 
axoneme forms core eukaryotic flagella cilia one largest macromolecular machines structure largely conserved protists mammals microtubule doublets structural components axonemes contain number proteins besides tubulin usually found arrays nine doublets arranged around two singlet microtubules coordinated sliding adjacent doublets involves host proteins axoneme produces periodic beating movements axoneme obtained three-dimensional density map intact microtubule doublets using cryo-electron tomography image averaging map resolution nm provides insights locations particular proteins within doublets structural features doublets define mechanical properties identify likely candidates several non-tubulin components doublets work offers insight tubulin protofilaments accessory proteins attach together form doublets provides structural basis understanding doublet function axonemes
