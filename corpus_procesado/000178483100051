satb1 targets chromatin remodelling regulate genes long distances
eukaryotic chromosomes organized inside nucleus way subset genome expressed given cell type details organization largely unknown- satb1 special at-rich sequence binding protein found predominantly thymocytes regulates genes folding chromatin loop domains tethering specialized dna elements satb1 network structure ablation satb1 gene targeting results temporal spatial mis-expression numerous genes arrested t-cell development suggesting satb1 cell-type specific global gene regulator show satb1 targets chromatin remodelling il-2ralpha interleukin receptor alpha gene ectopically transcribed satb1 null thymocytes satb1 recruits histone deacetylase contained nurd chromatin remodelling complex satb1-bound site il-2ralpha locus mediates specific deacetylation histones large domain within locus satb1 also targets acf1 iswi subunits chrac acf nucleosome mobilizing complexes specific site regulates nucleosome positioning seven kilobases satb1 defines class transcriptional regulators function landing platform several chromatin remodelling enzymes hence regulate large chromatin domains
