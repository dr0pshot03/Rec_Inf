particle size energetics gouge earthquake rupture zones
grain size reduction gouge formation found ubiquitous brittle faults scales- slip along mature faults observed localized within gouge zones fine-grain gouge thought control earthquake instability- thus understanding properties central understanding earthquake process show gouge san andreas fault california similar km slip rupture zone recent earthquake south african mine similar m slip display similar characteristics ultrafine grains approach nanometre scale gouge surface areas approach m g- grain size distribution nonfractal observations challenge common perception gouge texture fractal gouge surface energy negligible contributor earthquake energy budget propose observed fine-grain gouge related quasistatic cumulative slip instead formed dynamic rock pulverization propagation single earthquake
