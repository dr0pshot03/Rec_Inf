interferometric identification pre-brown dwarf
known whether brown dwarfs [stellar-like objects masses less hydrogen-burning limit solar mass m] formed way solar-type stars process report clear-cut identification self-gravitating condensation gas dust mass brown-dwarf regime made millimeter interferometric observations level thermal millimeter continuum emission detected object indicates mass similar m-circle dot whereas small radius < astronomical units narrow spectral lines imply dynamical mass m-circle dot identification pre-brown dwarf core supports models according brown dwarfs formed manner hydrogen-burning stars
