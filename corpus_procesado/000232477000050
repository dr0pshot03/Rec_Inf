astrocytic purinergic signaling coordinates synaptic networks 
investigate rote astrocytes regulating synaptic transmission generated inducible transgenic mice express dominant-negative snare domain selectively astrocytes block release transmitters glial cells releasing adenosine triphosphate accumulates adenosine astrocytes tonically suppressed synaptic transmission thereby enhancing dynamic range long-term potentiation mediated activity-dependent heterosynaptic depression results indicate astrocytes intricately linked regulation synaptic strength plasticity provide pathway synaptic cross-talk
