adaptive dynamics development-based genotype-phenotype maps
known whether natural selection can encounter given phenotype can produced genetic variation long-lasting debate processes limit adaptation- consequently well adapted phenotypes examine development may affect adaptation decomposing genotype-fitness map-the association genotype fitness-into two: one mapping genotype phenotype means computational model organ development one mapping phenotype fitness map phenotype fitness fitness individual based similarity realized morphology optimal morphology use three different simulations map phenotype fitness differ way similarity calculated: similarity calculated trait terms cell position individually large small number phenotypic landmarks many-traits few-traits phenotype-fitness maps measuring overall surface roughness morphology roughness phenotype-fitness map evolution simulated applying genotype-phenotype map one phenotype-fitness map individual population well random mutation drift show complexity genotype-phenotype map prevents substantial adaptation phenotype-fitness maps: sustained adaptation possible using roughness few-traits phenotype-fitness maps results contribute developmental understanding long-standing question aspects phenotype can effectively optimized natural selection
