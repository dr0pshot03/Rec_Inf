phosphorylation cyclin b-cdk underlies release mitotic exit activator cdc14 nucleolus
budding yeast protein phosphatase cdc14 sequestered nucleolus inactive state interphase anchor protein net1 upon entry anaphase cdc14 early anaphase release fear network initiates dispersal active cdc14 throughout cell report fear network promotes phosphorylation net1 cyclin-dependent kinase cdk complexed cyclin b1 cyclin b2 phosphorylations appear required fear sustain proper timing late mitotic events thus regulatory circuit exists ensure arbiter mitotic state cdk sets motion events culminate exit mitosis
