inverse melting vortex lattice 
inverse melting process crystal reversibly transforms liquid amorphous phase temperature decreased process considered rare search often hampered formation non-equilibrium states intermediate phases report discovery first-order inverse melting lattice formed magnetic flux lines high-temperature superconductor low temperatures disorder material pins vortices preventing observation equilibrium properties therefore determination whether phase transition occurs using technique dither vortices able equilibrate lattice enabled us obtain direct thermodynamic evidence inverse melting ordered lattice disordered vortex phase temperature decreased ordered lattice larger entropy low-temperature disordered phase mechanism first-order phase transition changes gradually thermally induced melting high temperatures disorder-induced transition low temperatures
