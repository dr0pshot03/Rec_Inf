molecular hydrogen energy source helicobacter pylori 
gastric pathogen helicobacter pylori known able use molecular hydrogen respiratory substrate grown laboratory found hydrogen available gastric mucosa mice use greatly increased stomach colonization h pylori hydrogenase activity h pylori constitutive increased fivefold upon incubation hydrogen hydrogen concentrations measured stomachs live mice found times high h pylori affinity hydrogen hydrogenase mutant strain much less efficient colonization mice therefore hydrogen present animals consequence normal colonic ora energy-yielding substrate can facilitate maintenance pathogenic bacterium
