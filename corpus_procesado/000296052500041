light propagation phase discontinuities: generalized laws reflection refraction
conventional optical components rely gradual phase shifts accumulated light propagation shape light beams new degrees freedom attained introducing abrupt phase changes scale wavelength two-dimensional array optical resonators spatially varying phase response subwavelength separation can imprint phase discontinuities propagating light traverses interface two media anomalous reflection refraction phenomena observed regime optically thin arrays metallic antennas silicon linear phase variation along interface excellent agreement generalized laws derived fermats principle phase discontinuities provide great flexibility design light beams illustrated generation optical vortices use planar designer metallic interfaces
