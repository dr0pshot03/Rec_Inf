cd8+ t lymphocyte mobilization virus-infected tissue requires cd4+ t-cell help
cd4+ t helper cells well known role providing critical signals priming cytotoxic cd8+ t lymphocyte ctl responses vivo t-cell help required generation primary ctl responses well promoting protective cd8+ memory t-cell development however role cd4 help control ctl responses effector stage unknown show fully helped effector ctls self-sufficient entry infected tissue rely cd4+ t cells provide necessary cue cd4+ t helper cells control migration ctl indirectly secretion ifn-gamma induction local chemokine secretion infected tissue results reveal previously unappreciated role cd4 help mobilizing effector ctl peripheral sites infection help eliminate infected cells
