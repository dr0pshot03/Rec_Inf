manipulation elementary charge silicon charge-coupled device 
ultimate limit operation electronic device manipulation single charge limit achieved single-electron tunnelling devices12 however devices based multiple tunnel barriers conductive islands complex structures fabricate demonstrate another type device can also manipulate elementary charge suitable large-scale integration device consists two closely packed silicon wire-mosfets commonly used building blocks electronic circuits developed scheme generate store holes channels either mosfets subsequently holes can transferred two mosfets level elementary charge exact position can monitored single-charge transfer device operated k effect charge-coupled device3 also first realization silicon-based device manipulates elementary charge
