partial quantum information 
information classical quantum measured amount communication needed convey classical case receiver prior information messages conveyed less communication needed explore concept prior quantum information: given unknown quantum state distributed two systems determine much quantum communication needed transfer full state one system communication measures partial information one system needs conditioned prior information find given conditional entropy quantity known previously lacked operational meaning classical case partial information must always positive find quantum world physical quantity can negative partial information positive sender needs communicate number quantum bits receiver negative sender receiver instead gain corresponding potential future quantum communication introduce protocol term quantum state merging optimally transfers partial information show enables systematic understanding quantum network theory discuss several important applications including distributed compression noiseless coding side information multiple access channels assisted entanglement distillation
