electron cryo-microscopy shows strong binding myosin actin releases nucleotide 
muscle contraction involves cyclic interaction myosin cross-bridges actin filament coupled steps hydrolysis atp1 bound actin cross-bridge undergoes conformational change often referred "power stroke" moves actin filament past myosin filaments; associated release products atp hydrolysis stronger binding myosin actin association new atp molecule weakens binding attached cross-bridge rapidly dissociates actin nucleotide hydrolysed conformational change reverses myosin cross-bridge reattaches actin x-ray crystallography determined structural basis power stroke still clear binding actin weakens nucleotide vice versa describe fitting atomic models actin myosin cross-bridge high-resolution electron cryo-microscopy three-dimensional reconstructions molecular basis linkage closing actin-binding cleft actin binds structurally coupled opening nucleotide-binding pocket
