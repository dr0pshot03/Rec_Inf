calcium store sensor stim1 reciprocally controls orai cav channels 
calcium signals pivotal controlling cell function can generated calcium entry channels activated plasma membrane depolarization depletion internal calcium stores reveal regulatory link two channel subtypes mediated ubiquitous calcium-sensing stim proteins stim1 activation store depletion mutational modification strongly suppresses voltage-operated calcium cav channels activating store-operated orai channels actions mediated short stim-orai activating region soar stim1 stim1 interacts cav channels localizes within discrete endoplasmic reticulum/plasma membrane junctions containing cav orai1 channels hence stim1 interacts reciprocally controls two major calcium channels hitherto thought operate independently coordinated control widely expressed cav orai channels major implications ca2+ signal generation excitable nonexcitable cells
