curvature metabolic scaling
three-quarters century assumed basal metabolic rate increases body mass raised power p however broad consensus regarding value p: whereas many studies asserted p / refs kleibers law argued / refs others found varies depending factors like environment taxonomy- show relationship mass metabolic rate convex curvature logarithmic scale therefore pure power law even accounting body temperature finding several consequences first provides explanation puzzling variability estimates p settling long-standing debate second constitutes stringent test theories metabolic scaling widely debated model based vascular system architecture fails test suggest modifications bring compliance observed curvature third raises intriguing question whether scaling relation limits body size
