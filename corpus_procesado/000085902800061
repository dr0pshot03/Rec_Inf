prostaglandin d mediator allergic asthma
allergic asthma caused aberrant expansion lung t helper cells produce type th cytokines characterized infiltration eosinophils bronchial hyperreactivity disease often triggered mast cells activated immunoglobulin e ige-mediated allergic challenge activated mast cells release various chemical mediators including prostaglandin d pcd2 whose role allergic asthma now investigated generation mice deficient pcd receptor dp sensitization aerosol challenge homozygous mutant dp-/- mice ovalbumin ova induced increases serum concentration ige similar wild-type mice subjected model asthma however concentrations th cytokines extent lymphocyte accumulation lung ova-challenged dp-/ mice greatly reduced compared wild-type animals moreover dp-/ mice showed marginal infiltration eosinophils failed develop airway hyperreactivity thus pgd functions mast cell-derived mediator trigger asthmatic responses
