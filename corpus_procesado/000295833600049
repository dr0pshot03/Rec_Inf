escherichia coli replisome inherently dna damage tolerant
escherichia coli dna replication machinery must frequently overcome template lesions normal growth conditions yet outcome collision replisome leading-strand template lesion remains poorly understood demonstrate single site-specific cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer leading-strand template lesion provides transient block fork progression vitro replisome remains stably associated fork collision lesion leading-strand synthesis reinitiated downstream damage reaction dependent primase dnag independent known replication-restart proteins observations reveal replisome can tolerate leading-strand template lesions without dissociating synthesizing leading strand discontinuously
