micellar nanocontainers distribute defined cytoplasmic organelles 
block copolymer micelles water-soluble biocompatible nanocontainers great potential delivering hydrophobic drugs understanding cellular distribution essential achieving selective delivery drugs subcellular level triple-labeling confocal microscopy live cells revealed localization micelles several cytoplasmic organelles including mitochondria nucleus moreover micelles change cellular distribution increase amount agent delivered cells micelles may thus worth exploring potential selectively deliver drugs specified subcellular targets
