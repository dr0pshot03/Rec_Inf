cloned pigs produced nuclear transfer adult somatic cells 
since first report live mammals produced nuclear transfer cultured differentiated cell population ref successful development obtained sheep23 cattle4 mice5 goats6 using variety somatic cell types nuclear donors methodology used embryo reconstruction species essentially similar: diploid donor nuclei transplanted enucleated mii oocytes activated transfer sheep2 goat6 preactivated oocytes also proved successful cytoplast recipients reconstructed embryos cultured selected embryos transferred surrogate recipients development term pigs nuclear transfer significantly less successful; single piglet reported transfer blastomere nucleus four-cell embryo enucleated oocyte7; however live offspring obtained studies using somatic cells diploid mitotic fetal fibroblasts nuclear donors89 development embryos reconstructed nuclear transfer dependent upon range factors investigate factors report successful production cloned piglets cultured adult somatic cell population using new nuclear transfer procedure
