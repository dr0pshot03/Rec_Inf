multiple glassy states simple model system
experiments theory simulation used study glass formation simple model system composed hard spheres short-range attraction sticky hard spheres experiments using well-characterized colloids revealed reentrant glass transition line mode-coupling theory calculations molecular dynamics simulations suggest reentrance due existence two qualitatively different glassy states: one dominated repulsion structural arrest due caging attraction structural arrest due bonding picture consistent study particle dynamics colloid using dynamic light scattering
