mutation egf repeat- notch discriminates serrate/jagged delta family ligands 
notch signaling affects many developmental cellular processes implicated congenital disorders stroke numerous cancers notch receptor binds ligands delta serrate able discriminate different contexts however specific domains notch responsible selectivity poorly defined genetic screens drosophila isolated mutation notchjigsaw affects serrate-but delta-dependent signaling notchjigsaw carries missense mutation epidermal growth factor repeat- egfr- defective serrate binding homologous point mutation mammalian notch2 also exhibits defects signaling mammalian serrate homolog jagged1 hence evolutionarily conserved valine egfr- essential ligand selectivity provides molecular handle study numerous notch-dependent signaling events
