chloroquine resistance plasmodium falciparum malaria parasites conferred pfcrt mutations 
plasmodium falciparum chloroquine resistance major cause worldwide increases malaria mortality morbidity recent laboratory clinical studies associated chloroquine resistance point mutations gene pfcrt however direct proof causal relationship remained elusive models posited multigenic basis resistance provide conclusive evidence mutant haplotypes pfcrt gene product asian african south american origin confer chloroquine resistance characteristic verapamil reversibility reduced chloroquine accumulation pfcrt mutations increased susceptibility artemisinin quinine minimally affected amodiaquine activity; hence antimalarials warrant investigation agents control chloroquine-resistant falciparum malaria
