mutational landscape significance across major cancer types
cancer genome atlas tcga used latest sequencing analysis methods identify somatic variants across thousands tumours present data analytical results point mutations small insertions/deletions tumours across tumour types part tcga pan-cancer effort illustrate distributions mutation frequencies types contexts across tumour types establish links tissues origin environmental/carcinogen influences dna repair defects using integrated data sets identified significantly mutated genes well-knownfor example mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatidylinositol--oh kinase wnt/beta-catenin receptor tyrosine kinase signalling pathways cell cycle control emerging example histone histone modification splicing metabolism proteolysis cellular processes cancer average number mutations significantly mutated genes varies across tumour types tumours two six indicating number driver mutations required oncogenesis relatively small mutations transcriptional factors/regulators show tissue specificity whereas histone modifiers often mutated across several cancer types clinical association analysis identifies genes significant effect survival investigations mutations respect clonal/subclonal architecture delineate temporal orders tumorigenesis taken together results lay groundwork developing new diagnostics individualizing cancer treatment
