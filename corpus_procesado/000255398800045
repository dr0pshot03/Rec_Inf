hydatellaceae water lilies gymnospermous tendencies 
flowering plant family hydatellaceae recently discovered allied ancient angiosperm lineage nymphaeales water lilies critical phylogenetic position members hydatellaceae potential provide insights origin early diversification angiosperms report hydatella expresses several rare embryological features combination found members nymphaeales maturity female gametophyte four celled four nucleate will produce diploid endosperm characteristic early divergent angiosperm lineages members nymphaeales endosperm hydatella minimally developed perisperm major embryo nourishing tissue within seed remarkably hydatella exhibits maternal seed-provisioning strategy unique among flowering plants common gymnosperms: pre fertilization allocation nutrients embryo nourishing tissue exceptional case pre fertilization maternal provisioning seed hydatella may well apomorphic feature hydatellaceae alone given newly discovered phylogenetic position family potentially represents plesiomorphic transitional condition associated origin flowering plants gymnospermous ancestors
