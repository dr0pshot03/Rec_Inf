implications vlbi distance double pulsar j0737-3039a/b 
double pulsar j0737-3039a/b unique system test gravitational theories strong-field regime however accuracy tests will limited knowledge distance relative motion system present long baseline interferometry vlbi observations reveal distance psr j0737-3039a/b -+ parsecs double previous estimates confirm low transverse velocity similar kilometers per second combined decade pulsar timing results will allow tests gravitational radiation emission theories % uncertainty level putting stringent constraints theories predict dipolar gravitational radiation also allow insight systems formation source high-energy emission
