marginal breakdown fermi-liquid state border metallic ferromagnetism
past half century understanding interactions electrons affect low-temperature properties metals based landau theory fermi liquid recent times however increasingly large number examples predictions fermi-liquid theory appear violated although qualitative reasons breakdown generally understood specific quantum states replace fermi liquid remain many cases unclear describe example breakdown non fermi liquid properties can interpreted show thermal electrical resistivities high purity samples d-electron metal zrzn low temperatures t t/ temperature dependences respectively: signatures marginal fermi liquid state- expected arise effective long-range spin spin interactions metal border metallic ferromagnetism three dimensions marginal fermi liquid provides link conventional fermi liquid exotic non fermi liquid states growing interest condensed matter physics idea marginal fermi liquid also arisen contexts example phenomenology normal state copper oxide superconductors studies relativistic plasmas nuclear matter
