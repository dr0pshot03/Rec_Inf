cdc2 links drosophila cell cycle asymmetric division machineries 
asymmetric cell divisions can mediated preferential segregation cell-fate determinants one two sibling daughters drosophila neural progenitors inscuteable- partner inscuteable bazooka localize apical cortical complex interphase directs apical-basal orientation mitotic spindle well basal/cortical localization cell-fate determinants numb and/or prospero mitosis although localization proteins shows dependence cell cycle involvement cell-cycle components asymmetric divisions demonstrated show neural progenitor asymmetric divisions require cell-cycle regulator cdc2 attenuating drosophila cdc2 function without blocking mitosis normally asymmetric progenitor divisions become defective failing correctly localize asymmetric components mitosis and/or resolve distinct sibling fates cdc2 necessary initiating apical complex formation interphase however maintaining asymmetric localization apical components mitosis requires cdc2/b-type cyclin complexes findings link cdc2 asymmetric divisions explain asymmetric localization molecules like inscuteable show cell-cycle dependence
