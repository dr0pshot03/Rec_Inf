making moon fast-spinning earth: giant impact followed resonant despinning 
common origin moon earth required identical isotopic composition however simulations current giant impact hypothesis moon formation find lunar material originated impactor different isotopic signature previous moon-formation studies assumed angular momentum impact similar present day however earth-mass planets expected higher spin rates end accretion show typical last giant impacts onto fast-spinning proto-earth can produce moon-forming disk derived primarily earths mantle furthermore find faster-spinning early earth-moon system can lose angular momentum reach present state orbital resonance sun moon
