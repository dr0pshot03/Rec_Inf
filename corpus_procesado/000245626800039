grassland species loss resulting reduced niche dimension
intact ecosystems contain large numbers competing coexisting species although numerous alternative theories provided potential explanations high biodiversity field experiments testing theories particular theory predicts higher diversity coexisting competitors result greater niche dimensionality example larger numbers limiting resources factors alternatively diversity independent niche dimensionality large numbers species can coexist limited just one two factors species appropriate trade-offs show plant coexistence diversity result niche dimensionality habitat plant species numbers decreased increasing numbers added limiting soil resources soil moisture nitrogen phosphorus base cations consistent theoretical predictions increased supply multiple limiting resources can reduce niche dimension observational field study gave similar results niche dimension hypothesis also explained diversity changes classic park grass experiment rothamsted results provide alternative mechanistic explanation effects nutrient eutrophication diversity terrestrial freshwater marine ecosystems
