energy capture thermolytic solutions microbial reverse-electrodialysis cells 
reverse electrodialysis allows capture energy salinity gradients salt fresh waters potential applications currently limited coastal areas need large number membrane pairs using salt solutions continuously regenerated waste heat > degrees c conventional technologies allow much wider applications salinity-gradient power production used reverse electrodialysis ion-exchange membrane stacks microbial reverse-electrodialysis cells efficiently capture salinity-gradient energy ammonium bicarbonate salt solutions maximum power density using acetate reached watts per square meter cathode surface area five times produced without dialysis stack +/ watts per square meter domestic wastewater maximum energy recovery acetate reached +/ %
