driven coherent oscillations single electron spin quantum dot
ability control quantum state single electron spin quantum dot heart recent developments towards scalable spin-based quantum computer combination recently demonstrated controlled exchange gate two neighbouring spins driven coherent single spin rotations permit universal quantum operations report experimental realization single electron spin rotations double quantum dot first apply continuous-wave oscillating magnetic field generated on-chip observe electron spin resonance spin-dependent transport measurements two dots next coherently control quantum state electron spin applying short bursts oscillating magnetic field observe eight oscillations spin state so-called rabi oscillations microsecond burst results demonstrate feasibility operating single-electron spins quantum dot quantum bits
