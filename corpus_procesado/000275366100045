large atomic chlorine source inferred mid-continental reactive nitrogen chemistry 
halogen atoms oxides highly reactive can profoundly affect atmospheric composition chlorine atoms can decrease lifetimes gaseous elemental mercury hydrocarbons greenhouse gas methane chlorine atoms also influence cycles catalytically destroy produce tropospheric ozone greenhouse gas potentially toxic plant animal life conversion inorganic chloride gaseous chlorine atom precursors within troposphere generally considered coastal marine air phenomenon report mid-continental observations chlorine atom precursor nitryl chloride distance 400km nearest coastline observe persistent significant nitryl chloride production relative consumption nitrogen oxide precursors comparison findings model predictions based aerosol precipitation composition data long-term monitoring networks suggests nitryl chloride production contiguous usa alone level similar previous global estimates coastal marine regions also suggest significant fraction tropospheric chlorine atoms may arise directly anthropogenic pollutants
