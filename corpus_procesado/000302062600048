ecological context influences epidemic size parasite-driven evolution 
occurrence magnitude disease outbreaks can strongly influence host evolution particular hosts face resistance-fecundity trade-off might evolve increased resistance infection larger epidemics increased susceptibility smaller ones tested theoretical prediction using zooplankton-yeast host-parasite system ecological factors determine epidemic size lakes high productivity low predation pressure large yeast epidemics outbreaks hosts became resistant infection however low productivity high predation epidemics remained small hosts evolved increased susceptibility thus modulating disease outbreaks ecological context productivity predation shaped host evolution epidemics consequently anthropogenic alteration productivity predation might strongly influence ecological evolutionary outcomes disease
