substrate elasticity regulates skeletal muscle stem cell self-renewal culture
stem cells naturally reside adult tissues muscle stem cells muscs exhibit robust regenerative capacity vivo rapidly lost culture using bioengineered substrate recapitulate key biophysical biochemical niche features conjunction highly automated single-cell tracking algorithm show substrate elasticity potent regulator musc fate culture unlike muscs rigid plastic dishes similar kilopascals muscs cultured soft hydrogel substrates mimic elasticity muscle kilopascals self-renew vitro contribute extensively muscle regeneration subsequently transplanted mice assayed histologically quantitatively noninvasive bioluminescence imaging studies provide novel evidence recapitulating physiological tissue rigidity propagation adult muscle stem cells possible enabling future cell-based therapies muscle-wasting diseases
