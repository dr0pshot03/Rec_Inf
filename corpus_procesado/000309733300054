hiv-infected t cells migratory vehicles viral dissemination
host entry mucosal surfaces human immunodeficiency virus hiv- disseminates lymphoid tissues establish generalized infection immune system mechanisms virus spreads among permissive target cells locally early stages transmission systemically subsequent dissemination known vitro studies suggest formation virological synapses stable contacts infected uninfected t cells greatly increases efficiency viral transfer unclear however whether t-cell contacts sufficiently stable vivo allow functional synapse formation conditions perpetual cell motility epithelial lymphoid tissues using multiphoton intravital microscopy examine dynamic behaviour hiv-infected t cells lymph nodes humanized mice find productively infected t cells migrate robustly resulting even distribution throughout lymph node cortex subset infected cells formed multinucleated syncytia hiv envelope-dependent cell fusion uncoordinated motility syncytia adhesion cd4+ lymph node cells led formation long membrane tethers increasing cell lengths ten times migrating uninfected t cells blocking egress migratory t cells lymph nodes efferent lymph vessels thus interrupting t-cell recirculation limited hiv dissemination strongly reduced plasma viraemia thus found hiv-infected t cells motile form syncytia establish tethering interactions may facilitate cell-to-cell transmission virological synapses migration t cells lymph nodes therefore spreads infection locally whereas recirculation tissues important efficient systemic viral spread suggesting new molecular targets antagonize hiv infection
