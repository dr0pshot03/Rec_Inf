sequence-based characterization structural variation mouse genome 
structural variation widespread mammalian genomes important cause disease just abundant important structural variants svs shaping phenotypic variation remains unclear without knowing many svs arise difficult discover combining experimental automated analyses identified svs sites genomes thirteen classical four wild-derived inbred mouse strains majority svs less kilobase size % deletions insertions breakpoints svs mapped base pair resolution allowing us infer insertion retrotransposons causes half svs yet despite prevalence svs less likely sequence variants cause gene expression quantitative phenotypic variation identified svs disrupt coding exons acting rare variants large effect gene function one-third genes affected immunological functions
