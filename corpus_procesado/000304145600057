strongly interacting rydberg excitations cold atomic gas 
highly excited rydberg atoms many exaggerated properties particular interaction strength atoms can varied enormous range mesoscopic ensemble strong long-range interactions can used fast preparation desired many-particle states generated rydberg excitations ultra-cold atomic gas subsequently converted light principal quantum number n increased beyond similar single excitation retrieved entire mesoscopic ensemble atoms results hold promise studies dynamics disorder many-body systems tunable interactions scalable quantum information networks
