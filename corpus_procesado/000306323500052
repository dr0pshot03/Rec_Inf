dislocation-driven deformations graphene
movement dislocations crystal key mechanism plastic deformation materials studies dislocations focused three-dimensional materials little experimental evidence regarding dynamics dislocations impact atomic level lattice structure graphene studied dynamics dislocation pairs graphene recorded single-atom sensitivity examined stepwise dislocation movement along zig-zag lattice direction mediated either single bond rotation loss two carbon atoms strain fields determined showing dislocations deform graphene elongation compression c-c bonds shear lattice rotations
