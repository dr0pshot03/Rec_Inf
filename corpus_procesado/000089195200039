molecular evidence early evolution photosynthesis 
origin evolution photosynthesis long remained enigmatic due lack sequence information photosynthesis genes across entire photosynthetic domain probe early evolutionary history photosynthesis obtained new sequence information number photosynthesis genes green sulfur bacterium chlorobium tepidum green nonsulfur bacterium chloroflexus aurantiacus total open reading frames encode enzymes involved bacteriochlorophyll/porphyrin biosynthesis carotenoid biosynthesis photosynthetic electron transfer identified kilobase pairs genomic sequence phylogenetic analyses multiple magnesium-tetrapyrrole biosynthesis genes using combination distance maximum parsimony maximum likelihood methods indicate heliobacteria closest last common ancestor oxygenic photosynthetic lineages green sulfur bacteria green nonsulfur bacteria others closest relatives parsimony distance analyses identify purple bacteria earliest emerging photosynthetic lineage results challenge previous conclusions based 16s ribosomal rna hsp60/hsp70 analyses green nonsulfur bacteria heliobacteria earliest phototrophs overall consensus phylogenetic analysis bacteriochlorophyll biosynthesis evolved chlorophyll biosynthesis also argues long-held granick hypothesis
