genome-scale approaches resolving incongruence molecular phylogenies 
one pervasive challenges molecular phylogenetics incongruence phylogenies obtained using different data sets individual genes systematically investigate degree incongruence potential methods resolving screened genome sequences eight yeast species selected widely distributed orthologous genes phylogenetic analyses singly concatenation results suggest data sets consisting single small number concatenated genes significant probability supporting conflicting topologies contrast analyses entire data set concatenated genes yielded single fully resolved species tree maximum support comparable results obtained concatenation minimum genes; substantially genes commonly used small fraction genome results important implications resolving branches tree life
