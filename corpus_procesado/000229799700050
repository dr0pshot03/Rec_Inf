notch/gamma-secretase inhibition turns proliferative cells intestinal crypts adenomas goblet cells
self-renewing epithelium small intestine ordered stem/progenitor crypt compartments differentiated villus compartments recent evidence indicates wnt cascade dominant force controlling cell fate along crypt-villus axis show rapid massive conversion proliferative crypt cells post-mitotic goblet cells conditional removal common notch pathway transcription factor csl/rbp-j ref obtained similar phenotype blocking notch cascade gamma-secretase inhibitor inhibitor also induced goblet cell differentiation adenomas mice carrying mutation apc tumour suppressor gene thus maintenance undifferentiated proliferative cells crypts adenomas requires concerted activation notch wnt cascades data indicate gamma-secretase inhibitors developed alzheimers disease might therapeutic benefit colorectal neoplastic disease
