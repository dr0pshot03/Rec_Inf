airborne transmissible avian influenza h5 hemagglutinin seen atomic level 
recent studies identified several mutations hemagglutinin ha protein allow highly pathogenic avian h5n1 influenza virus transmit mammals airborne route determined complex structures wild-type mutant derived indonesia h5n1 virus bound either avian human receptor sialic acid analogs cis/trans conformational change glycosidic linkage receptor analog observed explains h5n1 virus alters receptor-binding preference furthermore mutant ha possessed low affinities avian human receptors findings provide structural biophysical basis h5n1 adaptation acquire human maintain avian receptor-binding properties
