elastic coupling rna degradation unwinding exoribonuclease 
rrp44 dis3 key catalytic subunit yeast exosome complex can processively digest structured rna one nucleotide time direction motor function powered energy released hydrolytic nuclease reaction instead adenosine triphosphate hydrolysis conventional helicases single-molecule fluorescence analysis revealed instead unwinding rna single base pair steps rrp44 accumulates energy released multiple single nucleotide step hydrolysis reactions four base pairs unwound burst kinetic analyses showed rna unwinding cleavage strand release determines overall rna degradation rate unwinding step size determined nonlinear elasticity rrp44/rna complex duplex stability
