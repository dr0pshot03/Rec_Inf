increasing intensity strongest tropical cyclones
atlantic tropical cyclones getting stronger average year trend related increase ocean temperatures atlantic ocean elsewhere- rest tropics however possible trends tropical cyclone intensity less obvious owing unreliability incompleteness observational record restricted focus previous trend analyses changes average intensity overcome two limitations examining trends upper quantiles per cyclone maximum wind speeds maximum intensities cyclones achieve lifetimes estimated homogeneous data derived archive satellite records find significant upward trends wind speed quantiles 70th percentile trends high +/ m s- yr- se strongest cyclones note separate upward trends estimated lifetime-maximum wind speeds strongest tropical cyclones 99th percentile ocean basin largest increase quantile occurring north atlantic although basins show statistically significant increases results qualitatively consistent hypothesis seas warm ocean energy convert tropical cyclone wind
