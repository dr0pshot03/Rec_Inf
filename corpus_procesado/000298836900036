open structure ca2+ gating ring high-conductance ca2+-activated k+ channel 
high-conductance voltage-and ca2+-activated k+ channels function many physiological processes link cell membrane voltage intracellular ca2+ concentration including neuronal electrical activity skeletal smooth muscle contraction hair cell tuning1- like voltage-dependent k+ channels ca2+-activated k+ channels open cell membrane depolarizes contrast voltage-dependent k+ channels also open intracellular ca2+ concentrations rise channel opening ca2+ made possible structure called gating ring located cytoplasm recent structural studies defined ca2+-free closed conformation gating ring ca2+-bound open conformation yet known9 present ca2+-bound conformation gating ring structure shows one layer gating ring response binding ca2+ opens like petals flower degree opens explains ca2+ binding can open transmembrane pore findings present molecular basis ca2+ activation k+ channels suggest new possibilities targeting gating ring treat conditions asthma hypertension
