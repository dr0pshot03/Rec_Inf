quantum scattering interferometer
collision two ultracold atoms results quantum mechanical superposition two possible outcomes: atom continues without scattering atom scatters outgoing spherical wave s-wave phase shift magnitude s-wave phase shift depends sensitively interaction atoms quantum scattering underlying phase shifts vitally important many areas contemporary atomic physics including bose einstein condensates- degenerate fermi gases- frequency shifts atomic clocks- magnetically tuned feshbach resonances precise experimental measurements quantum scattering phase shifts possible number scattered atoms depends s-wave phase shifts well atomic density measured precisely demonstrate scattering experiment quantum scattering phase shifts individual atoms detected using novel atom interferometer performing atomic clock measurement using scattered part atoms wavefunction precisely measure difference s-wave phase shifts two clock states density-independent manner method will enable direct precise measurements ultracold atom atom interactions may used place stringent limits time variations fundamental constants
