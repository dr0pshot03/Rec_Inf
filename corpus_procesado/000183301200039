stability forest biodiversity 
two hypotheses explain potentially high forest biodiversity different implications number kinds species can coexist potential loss biodiversity absence speciation first hypothesis involves stabilizing mechanisms include tradeoffs species terms capacities disperse sites competition weak1- exploit abundant resources effectively56 compete scarce resources7 stabilization results competitors thrive different times places alternative neutral model suggests stabilizing mechanisms may superfluous explanation emphasizes equalizing mechanisms8 competitive exclusion similar species slow lack ecologically relevant differences means abundances experience random neutral drift slow extinction9- relative importance two mechanisms unknown assumptions predictions involve broad temporal spatial scales demonstrate predictions neutral drift testable using palaeodata results demonstrate strong stabilizing forces contrast neutral prediction increasing variance among sites time show variances post-glacial tree abundances among sites stabilize rapidly abundances remain coherent broad geographical scales
