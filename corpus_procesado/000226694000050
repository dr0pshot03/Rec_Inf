restoration tolerance lupus targeted inhibitory receptor expression 
lupus multigenic autoimmune condition breakdown tolerance results development autoantibodies leads variety pathologic outcomes despite heterogeneity factors influencing disease susceptibility demonstrate partial restoration inhibitory fc receptor fcgammariib levels b cells lupus-prone mouse strains sufficient restore tolerance prevent autoimmunity fcgammariib regulates common b cell checkpoint genetically diverse lupus-prone mouse strains modest changes expression can result either tolerance autoimmunity therefore increasing fcgammariib levels b cells may effective way treat autoimmune diseases
