transcriptional activation polycomb-repressed genes zrf1
covalent modification histones fundamental orchestrating chromatin dynamics transcription- one example epigenetic mark mono-ubiquitination histones mainly occurs histone h2a h2b- ubiquitination histone h2a implicated polycomb-mediated transcriptional silencing- however precise role ubiquitin mark silencing still elusive show human cell lines zrf1 zuotin-related factor specifically recruited histone h2a ubiquitinated lys means novel ubiquitin-interacting domain located evolutionarily conserved zuotin domain onset differentiation zrf1 specifically displaces polycomb-repressive complex prc1 chromatin facilitates transcriptional activation genome-wide mapping zrf1 ring1b h2a-ubiquitin targets revealed involvement regulation large set polycomb target genes emphasizing key role zrf1 cell fate decisions provide model molecular mechanism switching polycomb-repressed genes active state
