structure transcribing t7 rna polymerase transition initiation elongation 
structural studies t7 bacteriophage dna-dependent rna polymerase t7 rnap shown conformation amino-terminal domain changes substantially initiation elongation phases transcription transition achieved remains unclear report crystal structures t7 rnap bound promoter dna containing either nucleotide nt rna transcript illuminate intermediate states along transition pathway amino-terminal domain comprises c-helix subdomain promoter binding domain pbd consists two segments separated subdomain h structures intermediate complex reveal pbd bound promoter rotate degrees upon synthesis nt rna transcript allows promoter contacts maintained active site expanded accommodate growing heteroduplex c-helix subdomain moves modestly toward elongation conformation whereas subdomain h remains initiation rather elongation-phase location angstroms away
