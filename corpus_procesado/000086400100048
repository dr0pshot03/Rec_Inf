communication millimetre-submillimetre wavelengths using ceramic ribbon 
following discovery kao hockman- ultra-low-loss optical fibres made pure silica elimination impurities ability guide signals effectively optical wavelengths assured remains important region spectrum-from ghz millimetre-submillimetre band-where low-loss waveguides unknown main problem finding low-loss solids longer one eliminating impurities due presence intrinsic vibration absorption bands- use highly conducting materials also precluded owing high skin-depth losses part spectrum show combination material waveguide geometry can circumvent difficulties adopt ribbon-like structure aspect ratio : fabricated ceramic alumina coors alumina resulting waveguide attenuation factor less db km- millimetre-submillimetre band attenuation times smaller typical ceramic dielectric circular rod waveguide sufficient immediate application
