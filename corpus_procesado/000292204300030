morphological evolution caused many subtle-effect substitutions regulatory dna
morphology evolves often changes developmental genes causal mutations effects remain largely unknown evolution naked cuticle larvae drosophila sechellia resulted changes five transcriptional enhancers shavenbaby svb transcript ovo locus encodes transcription factor governs morphogenesis microtrichiae hereafter called trichomes show function one enhancers evolved multiple single-nucleotide substitutions altered timing level svb expression consequences nucleotide substitutions larval morphology quantified novel functional assay found substitution relatively small phenotypic effect many nucleotide changes account large morphological difference addition observed substitutions non-additive effects data provide unprecedented resolution phenotypic effects substitutions show individual nucleotide changes transcriptional enhancer caused morphological evolution
