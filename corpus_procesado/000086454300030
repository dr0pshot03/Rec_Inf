titanium carbide nanocrystals circumstellar environments 
meteorites contain micrometer-sized graphite grains embedded titanium carbide grains although isotopic analysis identifies asymptotic giant branch stars birth sites grains direct observational identification grains astronomical sources report infrared wavelength spectra gas-phase titanium carbide nanocrystals derived laboratory show prominent feature wavelength micrometers compares well similar feature observed spectra postasymptotic giant branch stars concluded titanium carbide forms short approximately years phase catastrophic mass loss > solar masses per year dying low-mass stars
