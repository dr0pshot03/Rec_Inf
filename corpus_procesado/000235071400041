ethanol can contribute energy environmental goals
study potential effects increased biofuel use evaluated six representative analyses fuel ethanol studies reported negative net energy incorrectly ignored coproducts used obsolete data studies indicated current corn ethanol technologies much less petroteum-intensive gasoline greenhouse gas emissions similar gasoline however many important environmental effects biofuel production poorly understood new metrics measure specific resource inputs developed research environmental metrics needed nonetheless already clear large-scale use ethanol fuel will almost certainly require cellulosic technology
