intramembrane proteotysis: theme variations
proteases reside cellular membranes apparently wield water hydrolyze peptide bonds substrates despite water-excluding environment although intramembrane proteases bear little sequence resemblance classical water-soluble proteases ostensibly converged similar hydrolytic mechanisms identification essential amino acid residues proteases suggests use residue combinations catalysis way soluble cousins contrast classical proteases however catalytic residues intramembrane proteases lie within predicted hydrophobic transmembrane domains elucidating biological functions intramembrane proteases identifying substrates understanding hydrolyze peptide bonds within membranes will shed light ways proteases regulate crucial biological processes contribute disease
