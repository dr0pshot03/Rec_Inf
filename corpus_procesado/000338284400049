fast long-lived outflow supermassive black hole ngc
supermassive black holes nuclei active galaxies expel large amounts matter powerful winds ionized gas archetypal active galaxy ngc studied decades high-resolution x-ray ultraviolet uv observations previously shown persistent ionized outflow observing campaign six space observatories shows nucleus obscured long-lasting clumpy stream ionized gas seen blocks % soft x-ray emission causes simultaneous deep broad uv absorption troughs outflow velocities gas five times faster persistent outflow distance light days nucleus may likely originate accretion disk
