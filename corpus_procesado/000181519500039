spread htlv-i lymphocytes virus-induced polarization cytoskeleton
cell contact required efficient transmission human t cell leukemia virus-type htlv- cells individuals naturally infected lymphocytes produce virtually cell-free infectious htlv-i particles however mechanism cell-to-cell spread htlv-i understood show cell contact rapidly induces polarization cytoskeleton infected cell cell-cell junction htlv-i core gag protein complexes htlv-i genome accumulate cell-cell junction transferred uninfected cell lymphotropic viruses hiv- may similarly subvert normal t cell physiology allow efficient propagation cells
