foxp influences speed accuracy perceptual decision drosophila 
decisions take time information gradually accumulates response threshold neural mechanisms integration thresholding unknown characterized decision process drosophila bears behavioral signature evidence accumulation stimulus contrast trained odor discriminations decreased reaction times increased perceptual accuracy declined quantitative agreement drift-diffusion model foxp mutants took longer wild-type flies form decisions similar reduced accuracy especially difficult low-contrast tasks rna interference foxp expression ab core kenyon cells overexpression potassium conductance neurons recapitulated foxp mutant phenotype mushroom body subdomain whose development function require transcription factor foxp thus supports progression decision toward commitment
