folding proteins fatal ways
human diseases characterized insoluble extracellular deposits proteins recognized almost two centuries amyloidoses thought represent arcane secondary phenomena questionable pathogenic significance now become clear many different proteins can misfold form extracellular intracellular aggregates initiate profound cellular dysfunction particularly challenging examples disorders occur post-mitotic environment neuron include alzheimers parkinsons diseases understanding principles protein folding helped explain diseases arise attendant therapeutic insights
