formation cyclic water hexamer liquid helium: smallest piece ice
cyclic water hexamer higher energy isomer cage structure previously characterized gas phase formed liquid helium droplets studied infrared spectroscopy isomer formed selectively result unique cluster growth processes liquid helium experimental results indicate cyclic hexamer formed insertion water molecules smaller preformed cyclic complexes rapid quenching provided liquid helium inhibits rearrangement stable cage structure
