glial origin mesenchymal stem cells tooth model system
mesenchymal stem cells occupy niches stromal tissues provide sources cells specialized mesenchymal derivatives growth repair origins mesenchymal stem cells subject considerable discussion current consensus holds perivascular cells form mesenchymal stem cells tissues continuously growing mouse incisor tooth offers excellent model address origin mesenchymal stem cells stem cells dwell niche tooth apex produce variety differentiated derivatives cells constituting tooth mostly derived two embryonic sources: neural crest ectomesenchyme ectodermal epithelium thought decades dental mesenchymal stem cells giving rise pulp cells odontoblasts derive neural crest cells migration early head formation ectomesenchymal tissue show significant population mesenchymal stem cells development self-renewal repair tooth derived peripheral nerve-associated glia glial cells generate multipotent mesenchymal stem cells produce pulp cells odontoblasts combining clonal colour-coding technique tracing peripheral glia provide new insights dynamics tooth organogenesis growth
