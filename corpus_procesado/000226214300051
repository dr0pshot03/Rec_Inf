requirement voltage-gated calcium channel beta subunit t lymphocyte functions retracted article see vol pg
calcium known play vital roles diverse physiological processes known voltage-gated calcium channels ca-v mediate calcium influx excitable cells however consensus exists molecular identity calcium channels present nonexcitable cells t lymphocytes demonstrate t lymphocytes express regulatory beta pore-forming cav alpha subunits ca-v channels ca-v beta-mutant t lymphocytes fail acquire normal functions display impairment calcium response activation transcription factor nfat cytokine production although cav channels lymphocytes retain voltage dependency t cell receptor stimulation dramatically increases channel opening providing new mechanism calcium entry lymphocytes
