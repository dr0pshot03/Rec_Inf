accelerated gene evolution replication-transcription conflicts 
several mechanisms increase rate mutagenesis across entire genome identified; however rate evolution might promoted individual genes unclear genes bacteria encoded leading strand replication1- presumably avoids potentially detrimental head-on collisions occur replication transcription machineries genes encoded lagging strand1- identify ubiquitous core genes bacillus subtilis determine % lagging strand find higher rate point mutations core genes lagging strand compared leading strand difference primarily amino-acid-changing nonsynonymous mutations determine overall genes strong negative selection amino-acid-changing mutations tend leading strand co-oriented replication contrast basis rate convergent mutations genes positive selection amino-acid-changing mutations commonly found lagging strand indicating faster adaptive evolution many genes head-on orientation increased gene length gene expression amounts positively correlated rate accumulation nonsynonymous mutations head-on genes suggesting conflict replication transcription driving force behind mutations indeed using reversion assays show difference rate mutagenesis genes two orientations transcription dependent altogether findings indicate head-on replication-transcription conflicts mutagenic co-directional conflicts encounters can significantly increase adaptive structural variation coded proteins propose bacteria potentially organisms promote faster evolution specific genes orientation-dependent encounters dna replication transcription
