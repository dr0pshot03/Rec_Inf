melanopsin required non-image-forming photic responses blind mice 
although mice lacking rod cone photoreceptors blind retain many eye-mediated responses light possibly photosensitive retinal ganglion cells cells express melanopsin photopigment confers photosensitivity mice lacking melanopsin still retain nonvisual photoreception suggesting rods cones operate capacity observed mice outer-retinal degeneration deficiency melanopsin exhibited complete loss photoentrainment circadian oscillator pupillary light responses photic suppression arylalkylamine-n-acetyltransferase transcript acute suppression locomotor activity light indicates importance nonvisual classical visual photoreceptor systems nonvisual photic responses mammals
