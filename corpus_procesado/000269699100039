rna-binding protein nanos2 required maintain murine spermatogonial stem cells 
stem cells give rise differentiated cell types also preserve undifferentiated state cell self-renewal use transgenic mice found rna-binding protein nanos2 essential maintaining spermatogonial stem cells lineage-tracing analyses revealed undifferentiated spermatogonia expressing nanos2 self-renew generate entire spermatogenic cell lineage conditional disruption postnatal nanos2 depleted spermatogonial stem cell reserves whereas mouse testes nanos2 overexpressed accumulated spermatogonia undifferentiated stem cell-like properties thus nanos2 key stem cell regulator expressed self-renewing spermatogonial stem cells maintains stem cell state murine spermatogenesis
