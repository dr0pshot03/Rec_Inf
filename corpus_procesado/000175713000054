genes involved late specification mandibular arch source vertebrate jaw expressed similar patterns oral regions chick lamprey embryos however morphological comparisons indicate apparently orthologous homeobox genes expressed different subdivisions ectomesenchyme two species therefore homology gene expression oral region uncoupled transition agnathan gnathostome conclude heterotopic shift tissue interaction involved evolution jaw
