fault weakening earthquake instability powder lubrication 
earthquake instability long attributed fault weakening accelerated slip central question earthquake physics identifying mechanisms control weakening even much experimental effort- weakening mechanisms remained enigmatic present evidence dynamic weakening experimental faults sheared velocities approaching earthquake slip rates experimental faults made room-dry solid granite blocks quickly wore form fine-grain rock powder known gouge modest slip velocities mm s- newly formed gouge organized thin deforming layer reduced faults strength factor slip gouge rapidly aged fault regained strength matter hours days therefore newly formed gouge can weaken experimental faults dynamic gouge formation expected common effective mechanism earthquake instability brittle crust gouge always forms fault slip- fault-gouge behaves similarly industrial powder lubricants dynamic gouge formation explains various significant earthquake properties gouge lubricant can form wide range fault configurations compositions temperatures
