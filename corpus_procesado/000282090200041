fault weakening earthquake instability powder lubrication 
earthquake instability long attributed fault weakening accelerated slip1 central question earthquake physics identifying mechanisms control weakening2 even much experimental effort2- weakening mechanisms remained enigmatic present evidence dynamic weakening experimental faults sheared velocities approaching earthquake slip rates experimental faults made room-dry solid granite blocks quickly wore form fine-grain rock powder known gouge modest slip velocities - mm s- newly formed gouge organized thin deforming layer reduced faults strength factor - slip gouge rapidly aged fault regained strength matter hours days therefore newly formed gouge can weaken experimental faults dynamic gouge formation expected common effective mechanism earthquake instability brittle crust gouge always forms fault slip51012-; fault-gouge behaves similarly industrial powder lubricants21; dynamic gouge formation explains various significant earthquake properties; gouge lubricant can form wide range fault configurations compositions temperatures15
