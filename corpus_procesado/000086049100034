whole-genome assembly drosophila 
report quality whole-genome assembly drosophila melanogaster nature computer algorithms accomplished three independent external data sources essentially agree support assemblys sequence ordering contigs across euchromatic portion genome addition isolated contigs believe represent nonrepetitive pockets within heterochromatin centromeres comparison previously sequenced -megabase region indicates sequencing accuracy within nonrepetitive segments greater % without manual curation initial reconstruction drosophila sequence substantial value scientific community
