para-aminosalicylic acid acts alternative substrate folate metabolism mycobacterium tuberculosis 
folate biosynthesis established anti-infective target antifolate para-aminosalicylic acid pas one first anti-infectives introduced clinical practice basis target-based drug discovery fifty years later pas continues used treat tuberculosis pas assumed inhibit dihydropteroate synthase dhps mycobacterium tuberculosis mimicking substrate p-aminobenzoate paba however found sulfonamide inhibitors dhps inhibited growth m tuberculosis weakly intracellular metabolism contrast pas served replacement substrate dhps products pas metabolism subsequent steps folate metabolism inhibited enzymes competing substrates pas thus prodrug blocks growth m tuberculosis active forms generated enzymes pathway poison
