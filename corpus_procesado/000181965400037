conservation total synaptic weight balanced synaptic depression potentiation
memory believed depend activity-dependent changes strength synapses part view based evidence efficacy synapses can enhanced depressed depending timing pre postsynaptic activity- however plastic synapses incorporated neural network models stability problems may develop potentiation depression synapses increases likelihood will strengthened weakened report biological evidence homeostatic mechanism reconciles apparently opposite requirements plasticity stability show intercalated neurons amygdala activity-dependent potentiation depression particular glutamatergic inputs leads opposite changes strength inputs ending dendritic sites result little change total synaptic weight occurs even though relative strength inputs modified furthermore hetero homosynaptic alterations blocked intracellular dialysis drugs prevent ca2+ release intracellular stores thus intercalated neurons least inverse heterosynaptic plasticity tends compensate homosynaptic long-term potentiation depression thus stabilizing total synaptic weight
