real-time observation initiation rna polymerase ii transcription 
biochemical structural studies shown initiation rna polymerase ii transcription proceeds following stages: assembly polymerase general transcription factors promoter dna closed preinitiation complex pic12; unwinding base pairs promoter dna form open complex34; scanning downstream transcription start site; synthesis short transcript thought nucleotides long; promoter escape assembled -protein -megadalton pic5 derived saccharomyces cerevisiae observe subsequent initiation processes real time optical tweezers6 contrary expectation scanning driven transcription factor iih7- involved rapid opening extended transcription bubble averaging base pairs accompanied synthesis transcript entire length extended bubble followed promoter escape pics failed achieve promoter escape nevertheless formed open complexes extended bubbles collapsed back closed open complexes resulting repeated futile scanning
