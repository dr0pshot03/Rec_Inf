detection gtp-tubulin conformation vivo reveals role gtp remnants microtubule rescues 
microtubules display dynamic instability alternating phases growth shrinkage separated catastrophe rescue events guanosine triphosphate gtp cap growing end microtubules whose presence essential prevent microtubule catastrophes vitro difficult observe vivo selected recombinant antibody specifically recognizes gtp bound tubulin microtubules found gtp tubulin indeed present plus end growing microtubules unexpectedly gtp tubulin remnants also present older parts microtubules suggests gtp hydrolysis sometimes incomplete polymerization observations living cells suggested gtp remnants may responsible rescue events microtubules recover catastrophe
