de novo mutations schizophrenia implicate synaptic networks
inherited alleles account genetic risk schizophrenia however new de novo mutations form large chromosomal copy number changes occur small fraction cases disproportionally disrupt genes encoding postsynaptic proteins show small de novo mutations affecting one ora nucleotides overrepresented among glutamatergic postsynaptic proteins comprising activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein arc n-methyl-d-aspartate receptor nmdar complexes mutations additionally enriched proteins interact complexes modulate synaptic strength namely proteins regulating actin filament dynamics whose messenger rnas targets fragile x mental retardation protein fmrp genes affected mutations schizophrenia overlap mutated autism intellectual disability mutation-enriched synaptic pathways aligning findings parallel case-control study demonstrate reproducible insights aetiological mechanisms schizophrenia reveal pathophysiology shared neurodevelopmental disorders
