decoherence-protected quantum gates hybrid solid-state spin register
protecting dynamics coupled quantum systems decoherence environment key challenge solid-state quantum information processing idle quantum bit qubit can efficiently insulated outside world dynamical decoupling recently demonstrated individual solid-state qubits- however protecting qubit coherence multi-qubit gate non-trivial problem: general decoupling disrupts interqubit dynamics hence conflicts gate operation problem particularly salient hybrid systems- different types qubit evolve decohere different rates present integration dynamical decoupling quantum gates standard hybrid system electron-nuclear spin register design harnesses internal resonance coupled-spin system resolve conflict gate operation decoupling experimentally demonstrate gates using two-qubit register diamond operating room temperature quantum tomography reveals qubits involved gate operation protected accurately idle qubits also perform grovers quantum search algorithm achieve fidelities % even though algorithm run-time exceeds electron spin dephasing time two orders magnitude results directly allow decoherence-protected interface gates different types solid-state qubit ultimately quantum gates integrated decoupling may reach accuracy threshold fault-tolerant quantum information processing solid-state devices
