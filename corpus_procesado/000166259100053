differential shunting epsps action potentials 
neurons encode information communicate via action potentials generated following summation synaptic events commonly assumed action potentials reset membrane potential completely allowing another round synaptic integration begin show conductances underlying action potential act instead variable reset synaptic integration strength reset cell type-specific depends kinetics location timing synaptic input consequence distal synapses well inputs mediated n-methyl-d-aspartate receptor activation can contribute disproportionately synaptic integration action potential firing
