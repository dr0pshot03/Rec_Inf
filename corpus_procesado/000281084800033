drought-induced reduction global terrestrial net primary production 
terrestrial net primary production npp quantifies amount atmospheric carbon fixed plants accumulated biomass previous studies shown climate constraints relaxing increasing temperature solar radiation allowing upward trend npp past decade warmest since instrumental measurements began imply continued increases npp however estimates suggest reduction global npp petagrams carbon large-scale droughts reduced regional npp drying trend southern hemisphere decreased npp area counteracting increased npp northern hemisphere continued decline npp weaken terrestrial carbon sink also intensify future competition food demand proposed biofuel production
