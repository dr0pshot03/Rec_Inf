characterization extrasolar terrestrial planets diurnal photometric variability 
detection massive planets orbiting nearby stars become almost routine current techniques yet unable detect terrestrial planets masses comparable earths future space-based observatories detect earth-like planets planned terrestrial planets orbiting habitable zones stars-where planetary surface conditions compatible presence liquid water-are enormous interest might global environments similar earths even harbour life light scattered planet will vary intensity colour planet rotates resulting light curve will contain information planets surface atmospheric properties report model predicts features discernible light curve obtained low-precision photometry extrasolar planets similar earth expect daily flux variations hundreds per cent depending sensitively ice cloud cover well seasonal variations suggests meteorological variability composition surface example ocean versus land fraction rotation period earth-like planet derived photometric observations even signatures earth-like plant life constrained possibly study even uniquely determined
