listeria monocytogenes impairs sumoylation efficient infection 
infection pathogenic bacteria manipulate host cell various ways allow replication propagation escape host immune responses post-translational modifications unique mechanisms allow cells rapidly locally specifically modify activity interactions key proteins modifications including phosphorylation ubiquitylation can induced pathogens however effects pathogenic bacteria sumoylation essential post-translational modification eukaryotic cells remain largely unknown show infection listeria monocytogenes leads decrease levels cellular sumo-conjugated proteins event triggered bacterial virulence factor listeriolysin o llo induces proteasome-independent degradation ubc9 essential enzyme sumoylation machinery proteasome-dependent degradation sumoylated proteins effect llo ubc9 dependent pore-forming capacity toxin shared bacterial pore-forming toxins like perfringolysin opfo pneumolysin ply ubc9 degradation also observed vivo infected mice furthermore show sumo overexpression impairs bacterial infection together results reveal listeria probably pathogens dampen host response decreasing sumoylation level proteins critical infection
