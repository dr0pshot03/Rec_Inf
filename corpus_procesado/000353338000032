nonequilibrium clumped isotope signals microbial methane 
methane key component global carbon cycle wide range anthropogenic natural sources although isotopic compositions methane traditionally aided source identification abundance multiply substituted "clumped" isotopologues example ch3d-c- recently emerged proxy determining methane-formation temperatures however effect biological processes methanes clumped isotopologue signature poorly constrained show methanogenesis proceeding relatively high rates cattle surface environments laboratory cultures exerts kinetic control ch3d-c- abundances results anomalously elevated formation-temperature estimates demonstrate quantitatively h- availability accounts effect clumped methane thermometry can therefore provide constraints generation methane diverse settings including continental serpentinization sites ancient deep groundwaters
