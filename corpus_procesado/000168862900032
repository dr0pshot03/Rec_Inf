rna-catalyzed rna polymerization: accurate general rna-templated primer extension
rna world hypothesis regarding early evolution life relies premise rna sequences can catalyze rna replication support conjecture describe rna molecule catalyzes type polymerization needed rna replication ribozyme uses nucleoside triphosphates coding information rna template extend rna primer successive addition nucleotides-more complete turn rna helix polymerization activity general terms sequence length primer template rnas provided terminus primer pairs template polymerization also quite accurate: primers extended nucleotides cloned sequenced sequenced nucleotides matched template
