fluctuations bistabilities catalyst nanoparticles 
show coverage fluctuations catalyst particles can drastically alter macroscopic catalytic behavior scrutinizing occurrence kinetic bistabilities demonstrated molecular beam experiments model catalysts macroscopically observable bistabilities vanish completely decreasing particle size previously predicted theory effect attributed fluctuation-induced transitions two kinetic reaction regimes transition rate controlled particle size surface defects results suggest fluctuation-induced effects represent general phenomenon affecting reaction kinetics nanostructured surfaces
