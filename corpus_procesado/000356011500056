kinetochore attachment sensed competitive mps1 microtubule binding ndc80c 
spindle checkpoint cell division cycle senses kinetochores attached microtubules prevents precocious onset anaphase can lead aneuploidy nuclear division cycle complex ndc80c major microtubule receptor kinetochore ndc80c also mediates kinetochore recruitment checkpoint proteins found checkpoint protein kinase monopolar spindle mps1 directly bound ndc80c two independent interactions interactions involved microtubule-binding surfaces ndc80c directly inhibited presence microtubules elimination one interaction human cells caused checkpoint defects expected failure detect unattached kinetochores competition mps1 microtubules ndc80c binding thus constitutes direct mechanism detection unattached kinetochores
