practical quantum key distribution protocol without monitoring signal disturbance 
quantum cryptography1- exploits fundamental laws quantum mechanics provide secure way exchange private information exchange requires common random bit sequence called key shared secretly sender receiver basic idea behind quantum key distribution qkd widely understood property attempt distinguish encoded quantum states causes disturbance signal result implementation qkd protocol involves estimation experimental parameters influenced eavesdroppers intervention achieved randomly sampling signal estimation many parameters high precision required portion signal sacrificed increases thus decreasing efficiency protocol910 propose qkd protocol based entirely different principle sender encodes bit sequence onto non-orthogonal quantum states receiver randomly dictates single bit calculated sequence eavesdropper unable learn whole sequence guess bit value correctly achievable rate secure key distribution calculated considering complementary choices quantum measurements two conjugate observables11 found practical implementation using laser pulse train achieves key rate comparable decoy-state qkd protocol12- often-used technique lasers also better tolerance bit errors finite-sized-key effects anticipate finding will give new insight probabilistic nature quantum mechanics can related secure communication will facilitate simple efficient use conventional lasers qkd
