continuous single-cell imaging blood generation haemogenic endothelium 
despite decades research identity cells generating first haematopoietic cells mammalian embryos unknown indeed whether blood cells arise mesodermal cells mesenchymal progenitors bipotent endothelial haematopoietic precursors haemogenic endothelial cells remains controversial- proximity endothelial blood cells sites embryonic haematopoiesis well similar gene expression led hypothesis endothelium generating blood however owing lacking technology impossible observe blood cell emergence continuously single cell level postulated existence haemogenic endothelial cells remains disputed using new imaging cell tracking methods show embryonic endothelial cells can haemogenic continuous long term single cell observation mouse mesodermal cells generating endothelial cell blood colonies possible detect haemogenic endothelial cells giving rise blood cells living endothelial haematopoietic cells identified simultaneous detection morphology multiple molecular functional markers detachment nascent blood cells endothelium directly linked asymmetric cell division haemogenic endothelial cells specified cells already expressing endothelial markers results improve understanding developmental origin mammalian blood potential generation haematopoietic stem cells embryonic stem cells
