concurrent fast slow cycling transcriptional activator endogenous promoter
gene regulation transcriptional activators bind periodically promoters either fast similar minute slow similar minutes cycle uncertain whether fast cycle occurs natural promoters function either cycle transcription remains unclear report fast slow cycling can occur simultaneously endogenous yeast promoter slow cycling system reflects oscillation fraction accessible promoters rather recruitment release stably bound transcriptional activators observation combined single cell measurements messenger rna mrna production argues fast cycling initiates transcription slow cycling regulates quantity mrna produced findings counter prevailing view slow cycling initiates transcription
