generation femtosecond pulses synchrotron radiation 
femtosecond synchrotron pulses generated directly electron storage ring ultrashort laser pulse used modulate energy electrons within -femtosecond slice stored -picosecond electron bunch energy-modulated electrons spatially separated long bunch used generate similar -femtosecond synchrotron pulses bend-magnet beamline spectral range infrared x-ray wavelengths technique can used generate similar -femtosecond x-ray pulses substantially higher flux brightness undulator synchrotron-based femtosecond x-ray sources offer possibility applying x-ray techniques ultrafast time scale investigate structural dynamics condensed matter
