lateralized cognitive processes lateralized task control human brain
principles underlying human hemispheric specialization poorly understood used functional magnetic resonance imaging letter visuospatial decision tasks identical word stimuli address two unresolved problems first hemispheric specialization depended nature task rather nature stimulus second analysis frontal candidate regions cognitive control showed increased coupling left anterior cingulate cortex acc left inferior frontal gyrus letter decisions whereas right acc showed enhanced coupling right parietal areas visuospatial decisions cognitive control thus localized hemisphere task execution
