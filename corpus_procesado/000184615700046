single molecule profiling alternative pre-mrna splicing
alternative pre-messenger rna splicing important mechanism generating protein diversity may explain part mammalian complexity arises surprisingly small complement genes describe digital polony exon profiling single molecule based technology studying complex alternative pre-messenger rna splicing technology allows researchers monitor combinatorial diversity exon inclusion individual transcripts minisequencing strategy provides single nucleotide resolution digital nature technology allows quantitation individual splicing variants digital polony exon pro ling can used investigate physiological pathological roles alternately spliced messenger rnas well mechanisms messenger rnas produced
