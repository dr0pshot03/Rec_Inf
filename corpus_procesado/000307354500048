divergent nematic susceptibility iron arsenide superconductor
within landau paradigm continuous phase transitions ordered states matter characterized broken symmetry although broken symmetry usually evident determining driving force behind phase transition can complicated coupling distinct order parameters show measurement divergent nematic susceptibility iron pnictide superconductor bafe1-xcoxas distinguishes electronic nematic phase transition simple ferroelastic distortion measurements also indicate electronic nematic quantum phase transition near composition optimal superconducting transition temperature
