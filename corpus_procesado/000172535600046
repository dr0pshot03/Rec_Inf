individual recognition mice mediated major urinary proteins 
ability recognize individuals essential many aspects social behaviour maintenance stable social groups parent-offspring mate recognition inbreeding avoidance modulation competitive relationships odours primary mediator individuality signals among many mammals one source odour complexity rodents possibly humans resides highly polymorphic major histocompatibility complex mhc olfactory acuity mice rats allows distinguish urinary odours congenic strains differing single genes within mhc although chemical mediators odorants unknown however rodent urine also contains class proteins termed major urinary proteins mups bind release small volatile pheromones shown combinatorial diversity expression mups among wild mice might great mhc protein concentrations million times higher show wild house mice mus domesticus urinary mups play important role individual recognition mechanism
