synaptic dysfunction depression: potential therapeutic targets
basic clinical studies demonstrate depression associated reduced size brain regions regulate mood cognition including prefrontal cortex hippocampus decreased neuronal synapses areas antidepressants can block reverse neuronal deficits although typical antidepressants limited efficacy delayed response times weeks months notable recent discovery shows ketamine n-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist produces rapid within hours antidepressant responses patients resistant typical antidepressants basic studies show ketamine rapidly induces synaptogenesis reverses synaptic deficits caused chronic stress findings highlight central importance homeostatic control mood circuit connections form basis synaptogenic hypothesis depression treatment response
