barcoding reveals complex clonal dynamics de novo transformed human mammary cells 
human breast cancers diversified genomically biologically time become clinically evident- early events involved genesis cellular context events occur thus difficult characterize present first formal evidence shared independent ability basal cells luminal progenitors isolated normal human mammary tissue transduced single oncogene krasg12d produce serially transplantable polyclonal invasive ductal carcinomas within weeks introduced either subrenally subcutaneously immunodeficient mice dna barcoding initial cells revealed dramatic change numbers sizes clones generated within weeks first appearance many new clones tumours passaged secondary recipients primary secondary tumours phenotypically heterogeneous primary tumours categorized transcriptionally normal-like system challenges previous concepts carcinogenesis normal human epithelia necessarily slow process requiring acquisition multiple driver mutations also presents first description initial events accompany genesis evolution malignant human mammary cell populations thereby contributing new understanding rapidity heterogeneity properties can develop
