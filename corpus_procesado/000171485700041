sperm ion channel required sperm motility male fertility
calcium cyclic nucleotides crucial roles mammalian fertilization molecules comprising ca2+-permeation pathway sperm motility poorly understood describe putative sperm cation channel catsper whose amino-acid sequence closely resembles single six-transmembrane-spanning repeat voltage-dependent ca2+-channel four-repeat structure catsper located specifically principal piece sperm tail targeted disruption gene results male sterility otherwise normal mice sperm motility decreased markedly catsper-/- mice catsper-/- sperm unable fertilize intact eggs addition cyclic-amp-induced ca2+ influx abolished sperm mutant mice catsper thus vital camp-mediated ca2+ influx sperm sperm motility fertilization catsper represents excellent target non-hormonal contraceptives men women
