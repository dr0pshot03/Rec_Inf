hydrogen sulphide release surface waters precambrian/cambrian boundary 
animal like multicellular fossils appeared towards end precambrian followed rapid increase abundance diversity fossils early cambrian period event also known cambrian explosion- changes environmental conditions precambrian/ cambrian transition myr ago suggested possible explanation event still matter debate- report molybdenum isotope signatures black shales two stratigraphically correlated sample sets depositional age around myr find transient molybdenum isotope signal immediately precambrian/ cambrian transition using box model oceanic molybdenum cycle find intense upwelling hydrogen sulphide rich deep ocean water best explains observed early cambrian molybdenum isotope signal findings suggest early cambrian animal radiation may triggered major change ocean circulation terminating long period proterozoic ocean stratified sulphidic deep water
