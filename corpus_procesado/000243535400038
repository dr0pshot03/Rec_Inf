water solubility aluminous orthopyroxene origin earths asthenosphere 
plate tectonics based concept rigid lithosphere plates sliding mechanically weak asthenosphere many models assume weakness asthenosphere related presence small amounts hydrous melts however mechanism may cause melting asthenosphere well understood show asthenosphere coincides zone water solubility mantle minerals pronounced minimum minimum due sharp decrease water solubility aluminous orthopyroxene depth whereas water solubility olivine continuously increases pressure melting asthenosphere may therefore related volatile enrichment minimum water solubility causes excess water form hydrous silicate melt
