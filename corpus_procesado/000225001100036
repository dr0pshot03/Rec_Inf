cation exchange reactions-in ionic nanocrystals 
cation exchange investigated wide range nanocrystals varying composition size shape complete fully reversible exchange occurs rates reactions much faster bulk cation exchange processes critical size identified shapes complex nanocrystals evolve toward equilibrium shape lowest energy exchange reaction critical size anion sublattice remains intact basic shapes initial nanocrystals retained throughout cation exchange size-dependent shape change can also used infer features microscopic mechanism
