yeast genome duplication followed asynchronous differentiation duplicated genes
gene redundancy observed yeast plant human genomes thought consequence whole-genome duplications- bakers yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae contains several hundred duplicated genes duplications occurred given speciation understand evolution yeast genome analysed orthologues genes several related yeast species basis inferred phylogeny set genes able deduce whether gene duplicated and/or specialized divergence two yeast lineages show gene duplications might occurred single event probably took place saccharomyces kluyveromyces lineages diverged evolution duplicated gene pair-such specialization differentiation two copies deletion single copy-has taken place independently throughout evolution species
