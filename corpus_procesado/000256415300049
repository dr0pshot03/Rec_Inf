nf-kappa b links innate immunity hypoxic response transcriptional regulation hif alpha
hypoxic response ancient stress response triggered low ambient oxygen o ref controlled hypoxia-inducible transcription factor hif whose subunit rapidly degraded normoxia stabilized o dependent prolyl hydroxylases phds target o dependent degradation domain inhibited- thus amount hif alpha controls genes involved energy metabolism angiogenesis regulated post translationally another ancient stress response innate immune response regulated several transcription factors among nf-kappa b plays central role nf-kappa b activation controlled kappa b kinases ikk mainly ikk-beta needed phosphorylation induced degradation kappa b inhibitors response infection inflammation ikk-beta modestly activated hypoxic cell cultures phds attenuate activation inhibited however defining relationship nf-kappa b hif alpha proven elusive using vitro systems reported hif alpha activates nf kappa b nf-kappa b controls hif alpha transcription hif alpha activation may concurrent inhibition nf-kappa b show use mice lacking ikk-beta different cell types nf-kappa b critical transcriptional activator hif alpha basal nf-kappa b activity required hif alpha protein accumulation hypoxia cultured cells liver brain hypoxic animals ikk-beta deficiency results defective induction hif alpha target genes including vascular endothelial growth factor ikk-beta also essential hif alpha accumulation macrophages experiencing bacterial infection hence ikk-beta important physiological contributor hypoxic response linking innate immunity inflammation
