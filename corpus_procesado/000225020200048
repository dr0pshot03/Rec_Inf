pancreatic islet-specific microrna regulates insulin secretion
micrornas mirnas constitute growing class non-coding rnas thought regulate gene expression translational repression several mirnas animals exhibit tissue-specific developmental-stage-specific expression indicating play important roles many biological processes- study role mirnas pancreatic endocrine cells cloned identified novel evolutionarily conserved islet-specific mirna mir- show overexpression mir suppressed glucose-induced insulin secretion conversely inhibition endogenous mir function enhanced insulin secretion mechanism secretion modified mir independent changes glucose metabolism intracellular ca+-signalling correlated direct effect insulin exocytosis myotrophin mtpn predicted validated target mir- inhibition mtpn small interfering si rna mimicked effects mir glucose-stimulated insulin secretion exocytosis thus mir regulator insulin secretion may thereby constitute novel pharmacological target treatment diabetes
