ionic high-pressure form elemental boron
boron element fascinating chemical complexity controversies shrouded element since discovery announced : new element turned compound containing less % boron % pure boron obtained although now know least polymorphs stable phase boron yet experimentally established even ambient conditions borons complexities arise frustration: situated metals insulators periodic table boron three valence electrons favour metallicity sufficiently localized insulating states emerge however subtle balance metallic insulating states easily shifted pressure temperature impurities report results high pressure experiments ab initio evolutionary crystal structure predictions explore structural stability boron pressure strikingly reveal partially ionic high-pressure boron phase new phase stable gpa can quenched ambient conditions hitherto unknown structure space group pnnm atoms unit cell consisting icosahedral b clusters b pairs nacl type arrangement find ionicity phase affects electronic bandgap infrared adsorption dielectric constants arises different electronic properties b pairs b clusters resultant charge transfer
