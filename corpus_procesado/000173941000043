global environmental controls diversity large herbivores
large mammalian herbivores occupy half earths land surface important ecologically economically diversity threatened human activities investigated diversity large herbivores changes across gradients global precipitation soil fertility show plant-available moisture reduces nutrient content plants increases productivity whereas plant-available nutrients increase factors larger herbivore species tolerate lower plant nutrient content require greater plant abundance highest potential herbivore diversity occur locations intermediate moisture high nutrients areas dry enough yield high quality plants support smaller herbivores productive enough support larger herbivores predictions fit observed patterns body size diversity large mammalian herbivores north america africa australia yield global map regions potentially high herbivore diversity thus gradients precipitation temperature soil fertility might explain global distribution large herbivore diversity help identify crucial areas conservation restoration
