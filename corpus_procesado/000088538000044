species diversity natural communities often strongly related productivity pattern relationship seems vary: diversity known increase monotonically productivity decrease monotonically productivity unimodally related productivity maximum diversity occurring intermediate levels productivity- mechanism underlying patterns remains obscure although many possibilities suggested- outline simple mechanism-involving selection heterogeneous environment-to explain patterns test using laboratory cultures bacterium pseudomonas fluorescens grew diverse cultures wide range nutrient concentrations found strongly unimodal relationship diversity productivity heterogeneous homogeneous environments result provides experimental evidence unimodal relationship often observed natural communities can caused selection specialized types heterogeneous environment
