branch-specific dendritic ca2+ spikes cause persistent synaptic plasticity
brain extraordinary capacity memory storage new information without disrupting previously acquired memories remains unknown show different motor learning tasks induce dendritic ca2+ spikes different apical tuft branches individual layer v pyramidal neurons mouse motor cortex ask-related branch-specific ca2+ spikes cause long-lasting potentiation postsynaptic dendritic spines active time spike generation somatostatin-expressing interneurons inactivated different motor tasks frequently induce ca2+ spikes branches branches spines potentiated one task depotentiated active seconds ca2+ spikes induced another task concomitantly increased neuronal activity performance improvement learning one task disrupted another task learned findings indicate dendritic-branch-specific generation ca2+ spikes crucial establishing long-lasting synaptic plasticity thereby facilitating information storage associated different learning experiences
