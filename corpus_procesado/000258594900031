star formation around supermassive black holes
presence young massive stars orbiting eccentric rings within tenths parsec supermassive black hole galactic center challenging theories star formation high tidal shear black hole tear apart molecular clouds form stars elsewhere galaxy transport stars galactic center also appears unlikely lifetimes conducted numerical simulations infall giant molecular cloud interacts black hole transfer energy closest approach allows part cloud become bound black hole forming eccentric disk quickly fragments form stars compressional heating due black hole raises temperature gas several hundred several thousand kelvin ensuring fragmentation produces relatively high stellar masses stars retain eccentricity disk sufficiently massive initial cloud produce extremely top heavy distribution stellar masses potentially repetitive process may explain presence multiple eccentric rings young stars presence supermassive black hole
