wnt-ryk signalling mediates medial-lateral retinotectal topographic mapping 
computational modelling suggested least two counteracting forces required establishing topographic maps ephrin-family proteins required anterior posterior medial lateral topographic mapping opposing forces well characterized wnt-family proteins recently discovered axon guidance cues find wnt3 expressed medial lateral decreasing gradient chick optic tectum mouse superior colliculus retinal ganglion cell rgc axons different dorsal ventral positions showed graded biphasic response wnt3 concentration-dependent manner wnt3 repulsion mediated ryk expressed ventral-to-dorsal decreasing gradient whereas attraction dorsal axons lower wnt3 concentrations mediated frizzleds overexpression wnt3 lateral tectum repelled termination zones dorsal rgc axons vivo expression dominant-negative ryk dorsal rgc axons caused medial shift termination zones promoting medially directed interstitial branches eliminating laterally directed branches therefore classical morphogen wnt3 acting axon guidance molecule plays role retinotectal mapping along medial lateral axis counterbalancing medial-directed ephrinb1-ephb activity
