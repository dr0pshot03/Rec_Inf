relaxation polymer electrolytes nanosecond timescale
relation mechanical electrical relaxation polymer/lithium-salt complexes fascinating still unresolved problem condensed-matter physics yet important bearing viability materials use electrolytes lithium batteries room temperature materials biphasic: consist fluid amorphous regions salt-enriched crystalline regions ionic conduction known occur predominantly amorphous fluid regions although conduction mechanisms yet fully understood widely accepted lithium ions coordinated groups ether oxygen atoms single perhaps double polymer chains move re-coordination oxygen-bearing groups formation disruption coordination bonds must accompanied strong relaxation local chain structure probe relaxation nanosecond timescale using quasielastic neutron scattering show least two processes involved: slow process translational character one two fast processes rotational character whereas former reflects slowing-down translational relaxation commonly observed polyethylene oxide polymer melts latter appears unique polymer electrolytes knowledge observed clear picture emerges lithium cations forming crosslinks chain segments thereby profoundly altering dynamics polymer network
