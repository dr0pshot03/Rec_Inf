voltage-gated sodium channel grasshopper mice defends bark scorpion toxin 
painful venoms used deter predators pain however can signal damage thus serves important adaptive function evolution reduce general pain responses although valuable preying venomous species rare likely comes risk reduced response tissue damage bark scorpions capitalize protective pain pathway predators inflicting intensely painful stings however grasshopper mice regularly attack consume bark scorpions grooming briefly stung bark scorpion venom induces pain many mammals house mice rats humans activating voltage-gated na+ channel nav17 effect nav18 grasshopper mice nav18 amino acid variants bind bark scorpion toxins inhibit na+ currents blocking action potential propagation inducing analgesia thus grasshopper mice solved predator-pain problem using toxin bound nontarget channel block transmission pain signals venom initiating
