direction-specific interactions control crystal growth oriented attachment 
oriented attachment molecular clusters nanoparticles solution now recognized important mechanism crystal growth many materials yet alignment process attachment mechanism established performed high-resolution transmission electron microscopy using fluid cell directly observe oriented attachment iron oxyhydroxide nanoparticles particles undergo continuous rotation interaction find perfect lattice match sudden jump contact occurs less nanometer followed lateral atom-by-atom addition initiated contact point interface elimination proceeds rate consistent curvature dependence gibbs free energy measured translational rotational accelerations show strong highly direction-specific interactions drive crystal growth via oriented attachment
