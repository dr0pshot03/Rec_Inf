galanin neurons medial preoptic area govern parental behaviour 
mice display robust stereotyped behaviours towards pups: virgin males typically attack pups whereas virgin females sexually experienced males females display parental care show virgin males genetically impaired vomeronasal sensing attack pups parental furthermore uncover subset galanin-expressing neurons medial preoptic area mpoa specifically activated male female parenting different subpopulation activated mating genetic ablation mpoa galanin neurons results marked impairment parental responses males females affects male mating optogenetic activation neurons virgin males suppresses inter-male pup-directed aggression induces pup grooming thus mpoa galanin neurons emerge essential regulatory node male female parenting behaviour social responses results provide entry point circuit-level dissection parental behaviour modulation social experience
