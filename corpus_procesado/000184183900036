creep-strengthening steel high temperatures using nano-sized carbonitride dispersions
creep time-dependent mechanism plastic deformation takes place range materials low stress-that stresses lower yield stress metals alloys can designed withstand creep high temperatures usually process called dispersion strengthening fine particles evenly distributed throughout matrix example high-temperature creep-resistant ferritic steels achieve optimal creep strength k dispersion yttrium oxide nanoparticles however oxide particles introduced complicated mechanical alloying techniques result production large-scale industrial components economically unfeasible report production per cent cr martensitic steel dispersed nanometre-scale carbonitride particles using conventional processing techniques k dispersion-strengthened material exhibits time-to-rupture increased two orders magnitude relative current strongest creep-resistant steels improvement creep resistance attributed mechanism boundary pinning thermally stable carbonitride precipitates material also demonstrates enough fracture toughness results lead improved grades creep-resistant steels economical manufacture large-scale steel components high-temperature applications
