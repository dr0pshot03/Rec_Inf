ecology microbiome: networks competition stability
human gut harbors large complex community beneficial microbes remain stable long periods stability considered critical good health poorly understood develop body ecological theory help us understand microbiome stability although cooperating networks microbes can efficient find often unstable counterintuitively finding indicates hosts can benefit microbial competition competition dampens cooperative networks increases stability generally stability promoted limiting positive feedbacks weakening ecological interactions analyzed host mechanisms formaintaining stability-including immune suppression spatial structuring feeding community members-and support key predictions recent data
