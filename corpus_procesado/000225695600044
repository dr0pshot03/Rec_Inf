host-targeting signal virulence proteins reveals secretome malarial infection 
malaria parasites secrete proteins across vacuolar membrane erythrocyte inducing modifications linked disease parasite survival identified amino acid signal required secretion proteins plasmodium falciparum vacuole human erythrocyte bioinformatics predicted secretome > proteins conservation signal across parasite species functional studies indicated predictive value signal role targeting virulence proteins erythrocyte implicated recognition receptor/transporter erythrocyte modification parasite may involve plasmodial heat shock proteins vastly complex hitherto realized
