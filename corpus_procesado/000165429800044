use earthquake rate changes stress meter kilauea volcano 
stress changes earths crust generally estimated model calculations use near-surface deformation observational constraint widespread correlation changes earthquake activity stress1- led suggestions stress changes might calculated earthquake occurrence rates obtained seismicity catalogues although possibility considerable appeal seismicity data routinely collected good spatial temporal resolution method yet proven successful owing nonlinearity earthquake rate changes respect stress time however present two methods inverting earthquake rate data infer stress changes using formulation stress time-dependence earthquake rates6 application methods kilauea volcano hawaii yields good agreement independent estimates indicating earthquake rates can provide practical remote-sensing stress meter
