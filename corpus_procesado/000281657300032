coherence resonance single-walled carbon nanotube ion channel
biological ion channels able generate coherent oscillatory signals intrinsically noisy stochastic components ultrasensitive discrimination use stochastic resonance concept yet demonstrated human-made analogs show single-walled carbon nanotube demonstrates oscillations electroosmotic current interior specific ranges electric field signatures coherence resonance stochastic pore blocking observed individual cations partition nanotube obstructing otherwise stable proton current observed oscillations occur coupling pore blocking proton-diffusion limitation pore mouth result illustrates simple ionic transport can generate coherent waveforms within inherently noisy environment points new types nanoreactors sensors nanofluidic channels based platform
