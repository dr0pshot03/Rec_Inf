central issue ecology lies identifying importance resources natural enemies behaviour regulation animal populations much debate subject focused animals show cyclic fluctuations abundance- however still disagreement role extrinsic food parasites predators intrinsic behaviour factors causing cycles- recent studies examined impact natural enemies although spatial patterns resulting restricted dispersal recruitment increasingly recognized potential influence unstable population dynamics- tested hypothesis population cycles territorial bird red grouse lagopus lagopus scoticus caused delayed density-dependent changes aggressiveness spacing behaviour males show increasing aggressiveness experimentally short period autumn reduced recruitment subsequent breeding density % changed population trajectories increasing declining intrinsic processes can therefore fundamental effects population dynamics
