earthquake maze: compressional rupture branching m-w sumatra earthquake 
seismological observations moment magnitude sumatra earthquake reveal unprecedented complexity dynamic rupture surprisingly large magnitude results combination deep extent high stress drop rupture multiple faults back-projection source imaging indicates rupture occurred distinct planes orthogonal conjugate fault system relatively slow rupture speed east-southeast-west-northwest ruptures add new dimension seismotectonics wharton basin previously thought controlled north-south strike-slip faulting rupture turned twice compressive quadrant preferred branching direction predicted dynamic coulomb stress calculations orthogonal faulting compressional branching indicate rupture controlled pressure-insensitive strength deep oceanic lithosphere
