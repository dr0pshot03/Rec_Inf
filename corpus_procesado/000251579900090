metazoan eukaryotes express micrornas mirnas roughly nucleotide regulatory rnas can repress expression messenger rnas bearing complementary sequences several dna viruses also express mirnas infected cells suggesting role viral replication pathogenesis although specific viral mirnas shown autoregulate viral mrnas downregulate cellular mrnas function viral mirnas remains unknown report mir k12 mirna encoded kaposis sarcoma associated herpes virus kshv shows significant homology cellular mir including entire mirna seed region using range assays show expression physiological levels mir k12 mir results downregulation extensive set common mrna targets including genes known roles cell growth regulation findings indicate viral mir k12 functions orthologue cellular mir probably evolved exploit preexisting gene regulatory pathway b cells moreover known aetiological role mir b cell transformation- suggests mir k12 may contribute induction kshv-positive b cell tumours infected patients
