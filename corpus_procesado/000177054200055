modulation postendocytic sorting g-protein coupled receptors 
recycling mu opioid receptor plasma membrane endocytosis promotes rapid resensitization signal transduction whereas targeting delta opioid receptor dor lysosomes causes proteolytic down-regulation identified protein binds preferentially cytoplasmic tail dor candidate heterotrimeric gtp-binding protein g protein-coupled receptor-associated sorting protein gasp disruption dor-gasp interaction receptor mutation overexpression dominant negative fragment gasp inhibited receptor trafficking lysosomes promoted recycling gasp family proteins may modulate lysosomal sorting functional down-regulation variety g protein-coupled receptors
