evidence humans evolved knuckle-walking ancestor 
bipedalism traditionally regarded fundamental adaptation sets hominids apart primates fossil evidence demonstrates million years ago1 perhaps earlier2 hominids exhibited adaptations bipedal walking present however fossil record offers little information origin bipedalism despite nearly century research existing fossils comparative anatomy still consensus concerning mode locomotion preceded bipedalism3- present evidence fossils attributed australopithecus anamensis knm-er afarensis al - retain specialized wrist morphology associated knuckle-walking distal radial morphology differs later hominids non-knuckle-walking anthropoid primates suggesting knuckle-walking derived feature african ape human clads removes key morphological evidence pan-gorilla clade suggests bipedal hominids evolved knuckle-walking ancestor already partly terrestrial
