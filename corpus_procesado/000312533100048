symmetry-protected topological spt phases bulk-gapped quantum phases symmetries gapless degenerate boundary states long symmetries broken spt phases free fermion systems topological insulators can classified however known spt phases exist general interacting systems present systematic way construct spt phases interacting bosonic systems just group theory allows us construct crystal structures three-dimensional space use group cohomology theory systematically construct different interacting bosonic spt phases dimension symmetry leading discovery bosonic topological insulators superconductors
