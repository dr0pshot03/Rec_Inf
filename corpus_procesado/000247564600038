macrophage-specific ppar gamma controls alternative activation improves insulin resistance 
obesity insulin resistance cardinal features metabolic syndrome closely associated state low-grade inflammation adipose tissue chronic overnutrition leads macrophage infiltration resulting local inflammation potentiates insulin resistance instance transgenic expression mcp1 also known chemokine ligand ccl2 adipose tissue increases macrophage infiltration inflammation insulin resistance conversely disruption mcp1 receptor ccr2 impairs migration macrophages adipose tissue thereby lowering adipose tissue inflammation improving insulin sensitivity findings together suggest correlation macrophage content adipose tissue insulin resistance however resident macrophages tissues display tremendous heterogeneity activities functions primarily reflecting local metabolic immune microenvironment mcp1 directs recruitment pro-inflammatory classically activated macrophages sites tissue damage resident macrophages present adipose tissue lean mice display alternatively activated phenotype despite higher capacity repair tissue precise role alternatively activated macrophages obesity-induced insulin resistance remains unknown using mice macrophage-specific deletion peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-gamma ppar gamma showhere ppar gamma required maturation alternatively activated macrophages disruption ppar gamma myeloid cells impairs alternative macrophage activation predisposes animals development diet-induced obesity insulin resistance glucose intolerance furthermore gene expression profiling revealed downregulation oxidative phosphorylation gene expression skeletal muscle liver leads decreased insulin sensitivity tissues together findings suggest resident alternatively activated macrophages beneficial role regulating nutrient homeostasis suggest macrophage polarization towards alternative state might useful strategy treating type diabetes
