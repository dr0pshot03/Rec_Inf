encounter extrusion intrahelical lesion dna repair enzyme 
living systems detect presence genotoxic damage embedded million-fold excess undamaged dna unresolved question biology captured structurally elucidated base-excision dna repair enzyme mutm stage initial encounter damaged nucleobase -oxoguanine oxog nested within dna duplex three structures intrahelical oxog-encounter complexes compared sequence-matched structures containing normal g base place oxog lesion although protein-dna interfaces matched complexes differ two atoms-those distinguish oxog g-their pronounced structural differences indicate mutm can detect lesion dna even earliest stages encounter all-atom computer simulations show pathway encounter enzyme lesion causes extrusion dna duplex elucidate critical free energy difference oxog g along extrusion pathway
