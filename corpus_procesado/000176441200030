sub-laser-cycle electron pulses probing molecular dynamics
experience shows ability make measurements new time regime opens new areas science currently experimental probes attosecond time regime --- s established leading approach generation attosecond optical pulses ionizing atoms intense laser pulses nonlinear process leads production high harmonics collisions electrons ionized atoms underlying mechanism implies control energetic electrons attosecond precision propose electrons can exploited ultrafast measurements use molecular clock based vibrational wave packet h-+ show distinct bunches electrons appear electron-ion collisions high current densities durations femtosecond - s furthermore use molecular clock study dynamics non-sequential double ionization
