computer optimization minimal biped model discovers walking running
although peoples legs capable broad range muscle-use gait patterns generally prefer just two walk swinging body relatively straight leg step run bouncing bent leg aerial phases walking feels easiest going slowly running feels easiest going faster unusual gaits seem tiring perhaps walking running use least energy- addressing classic conjecture experiments requires comparing walking running many strange unpractised gaits alternative basic understanding gait choice might obtained calculating energy cost using mechanics-based models use minimal model can describe walking running well infinite variety gaits use computer optimization find gaits indeed energetically optimal model low speeds optimization discovers classic inverted-pendulum walk- high speeds discovers bouncing run even without springs intermediate speeds finds new pendular-running gait includes walking running extreme cases
