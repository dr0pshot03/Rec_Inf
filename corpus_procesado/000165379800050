coherence conservation
principal aim current conservation policy reduce impact habitat fragmentation conservation corridors may achieve goal facilitating movement among isolated patches risk increased connectivity synchronize local population fluctuations causing coherent oscillations thereby increase danger global extinction identify general conditions populations can undergo coherent oscillations relate conditions local global extinction probabilities suggest simple method explore potential success conservation corridors generally manipulations dispersal patterns aim protect threatened species control pests
