choice-specific sequences parietal cortex virtual-navigation decision task
posterior parietal cortex ppc important role many cognitive behaviours however neural circuit dynamics underlying ppc function well understood optically imaged spatial temporal activity patterns neuronal populations mice performing ppc-dependent task combined perceptual decision memory-guided navigation virtual environment individual neurons transient activation staggered relative one another time forming sequence neuronal activation spanning entire length task trial distinct sequences neurons triggered trials opposite behavioural choices defined divergent choice-specific trajectories state space neuronal population activity cells participating different sequences distinct time points task anatomically intermixed microcircuit length scales < micrometres working memory decision tasks ppc may therefore perform computations sequence-based circuit dynamics rather long-lived stable states implemented using anatomically intermingled microcircuits
