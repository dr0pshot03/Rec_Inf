mechanism actin filament pointed-end capping tropomodulin
proteins cap ends actin filament essential regulators cytoskeleton dynamics whereas several proteins cap rapidly growing barbed end tropomodulin tmod protein known cap slowly growing pointed end lack structural information severely limits understanding tmods capping mechanism describe crystal structures actin complexes unstructured amino-terminal leucine-rich repeat carboxy-terminal domains tmod structures biochemical analysis structure-inspired mutants showed one tmod molecule interacts three actin subunits pointed end also contacting two tropomyosin molecules side filament found tmod achieves high-affinity binding several discrete low-affinity interactions suggests mechanism controlled subunit exchange pointed end
