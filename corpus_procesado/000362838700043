ripk1 nf-kappa b signaling dying cells determines cross-priming cd8+ t cells
dying cells initiate adaptive immunity providing antigens inflammatory stimuli dendritic cells turn activate cd8+ t cells process called antigen cross-priming define different forms programmed cell death influence immunity established models necroptosis apoptosis dying cells generated receptor-interacting protein kinase caspase dimerization respectively found release inflammatory mediators damage-associated molecular patterns dying cells sufficient cd8+ t cell cross-priming instead robust cross-priming required receptor-interacting protein kinase ripk1 signaling nuclear factor kappa b nf-kappa b-induced transcription within dying cells decoupling nf-kappa b signaling necroptosis inflammatory apoptosis reduced priming efficiency tumor immunity results reveal coordinated inflammatory cell death signaling pathways within dying cells orchestrate adaptive immunity
