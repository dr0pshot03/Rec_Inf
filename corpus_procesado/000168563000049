scalable architecture mammalian brains 
comparison mammalian brain parts often focused differences absolute size- revealing general tendency parts grow together attempts find size-independent effects using body weight reference variable obscure size relationships owing independent variation body size give phylogenies questionable significance use brain size reference define cerebrotype species-by-species measure brain composition measure across many mammalian taxa cerebellum occupies constant fraction total brain volume +/ arguing hypothesis cerebellum acts computational engine principally serving neocortex mammalian taxa can well separated cerebrotype thus allowing use quantitative neuroanatomical data test evolutionary relationships primate cerebrotypes progressively shifted neocortical volume fractions become successively larger lemurs lorises new world monkeys old world monkeys hominoids lending support idea primate brain architecture driven directed selection pressure time absolute brain size can vary fold within taxon maintaining relatively uniform cerebrotype brains therefore constitute scalable architecture
