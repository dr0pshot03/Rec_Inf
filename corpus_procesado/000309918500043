coastal eutrophication driver salt marsh loss 
salt marshes highly productive coastal wetlands provide important ecosystem services storm protection coastal cities nutrient removal carbon sequestration despite protective measures however worldwide losses ecosystems accelerated recent decades present data nine-year whole-ecosystem nutrient-enrichment experiment study demonstrates nutrient enrichment global problem coastal ecosystems- can driver salt marsh loss show nutrient levels commonly associated coastal eutrophication increased above-ground leaf biomass decreased dense below-ground biomass bank-stabilizing roots increased microbial decomposition organic matter alterations key ecosystem properties reduced geomorphic stability resulting creek-bank collapse significant areas creek-bank marsh converted unvegetated mud pattern marsh loss parallels observations anthropogenically nutrient-enriched marshes worldwide creek-edge bay-edge marsh evolving mudflats wider creeks- work suggests current nutrient loading rates many coastal ecosystems overwhelmed capacity marshes remove nitrogen without deleterious effects projected increases nitrogen flux coast related increased fertilizer use required feed expanding human population may rapidly result coastal landscape less marsh reduce capacity coastal regions provide important ecological economic services
