escrt-iii assembly cytokinetic abscission induced tension release intercellular bridge
last step cell division cytokinesis produces two daughter cells remain connected intercellular bridge state often represents longest stage division process severing bridge abscission requires well-described series molecular events trigger abscission remains unknown found pulling forces exerted daughter cells intercellular bridge appear regulate abscission counterintuitively forces prolonged connection whereas release tension induced abscission tension release triggered assembly escrt-iii endosomal sorting complex required transport-iii followed membrane fission mechanism may allow daughter cells remain connected settled final locations process potentially important tissue organization morphogenesis
