rna-dependent rna polymerases viruses rna silencing
viruses rna genomes replicated transcribed messenger rna viral rna-dependent rna polymerases rdrps usually concert viral host factors many eukaryotes also encode putative rdrps implicated sequence-specific rna-triggered gene silencing although viral cellular rdrps sequence homology share functional similarities copying messenger rna templates intercellular spread amplified sequences better understanding viral host rdrps will improve ability control viruses use rna silencing viruses tools research biotechnology medicine
