continuous plasma outflows edge solar active region possible source solar wind
sun continuously expels huge amount ionized material interplanetary space solar wind despite influence heliospheric environment origin solar wind yet well identified paper report hinode x-ray telescope observations solar active region edge active region located adjacent coronal hole pattern continuous outflow soft-x-ray-emitting plasmas identified emanating along apparently open magnetic field lines upper corona estimates temperature density outflowing plasmas suggest mass loss rate amounts similar / total mass loss rate solar wind outflows may indicative one solar wind sources sun
