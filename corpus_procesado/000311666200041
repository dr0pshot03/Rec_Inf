superconducting dome gate-tuned band insulator
dome-shaped superconducting region appears phase diagrams many unconventional superconductors doped band insulators however reaching optimal superconductivity fine-tuning carriers seldom seen report observation superconducting dome temperature-carrier density phase diagram mos2 archetypal band insulator quasi-continuous electrostatic carrier doping achieved combination liquid solid gating revealed large enhancement transition temperature t-c occurring optimal doping chemically inaccessible low-carrier density regime observation indicates superconducting dome may arise even doped band insulators
