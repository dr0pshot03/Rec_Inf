membrane protein diffusion sets speed rod phototransduction 
retinal rods signal activation single receptor molecule photon ensure efficient photon capture rods maintain copies rhodopsin densely packed membranous disks high packing density rhodopsin may impede steps phototransduction take place disk membrane restricting lateral movement hence rate encounters molecules involved- although suggested lateral diffusion proteins membrane sets rate onset photoresponse later argued subsequent processing complexes main determinant rate effects protein density response shut-off reported show roughly % reduction protein crowding achieved hemizygous knockout rhodopsin transgenic mice accelerates rising phases recoveries flash responses -fold vivo thus rods rates response onset recovery set diffusional encounter frequency proteins disk membrane
