perceptual consequences centre-surround antagonism visual motion processing 
centre-surround receptive field organization ubiquitous property mammalian visual systems presumably tailored extracting image features differentially distributed space visual motion evident antagonistic interactions centre surround regions receptive fields many direction-selective neurons visual cortex- series psychophysical experiments make counterintuitive observation increasing size high-contrast moving pattern renders direction motion difficult perceive reduces effectiveness adaptation stimulus propose perceptual correlate centre-surround antagonism possibly within population neurons middle temporal visual area spatial antagonism motion signals observed high contrast gives way spatial summation contrast decreases evidently integration motion signals space depends crucially visibility signals thereby allowing visual system register motion information efficiently adaptively
