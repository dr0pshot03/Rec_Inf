adult mice generated induced pluripotent stem cells 
recent landmark experiments shown transient overexpression small number transcription factors can reprogram differentiated cells induced pluripotent stem ips cells resemble embryonic stem es cells1- ips cells hold great promise medicine potential generate patient-specific cell types cell replacement therapy produce vitro models disease without requiring embryonic tissues oocytes8- although current ips cell lines resemble es cells passed stringent test pluripotency generating full-term adult mice tetraploid complementation assays311 raising questions whether sufficiently potent generate cell types organism whether difference ips es cells reflects intrinsic limitations direct reprogramming known report fertile adult mice derived entirely ips cells generated inducible genetic reprogramming mouse embryonic fibroblasts producing adult mice derived entirely reprogrammed fibroblast shows features differentiated cell can restored embryonic level pluripotency without exposure unknown ooplasmic factors comparing fully pluripotent ips cell lines less developmentally potent lines may reveal molecular markers different pluripotent states furthermore mice derived entirely ips cells will provide new resource assess functional genomic stability cells tissues derived ips cells important validate utility cell replacement therapy research applications
