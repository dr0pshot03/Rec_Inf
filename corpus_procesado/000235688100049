structure dna glycosylase searching lesions 
dna glycosylases must interrogate millions base pairs undamaged dna order locate excise one damaged nucleobase nature search process remains poorly understood report use disulfide cross-linking dxl technology obtain structures bacterial dna glycosylase mutm interrogating undamaged dna structures solved angstrom resolution reveal nature search process: protein inserts probe residue helical stack severely buckles target base pair remains intrahelical mutm therefore actively interrogates intact dna helix white searching damage
