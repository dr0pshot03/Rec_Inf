haematopoietic stem cells transdifferentiate cardiac myocytes myocardial infarcts 
mammalian heart limited regenerative capacity hence heals scar formation recent reports suggest haematopoietic stem cells can transdifferentiate unexpected phenotypes skeletal muscle hepatocytes epithelial cells neurons endothelial cells cardiomyocytes response tissue injury placement new environment furthermore transplanted human hearts contain myocytes derived extra-cardiac progenitor cells- may originated bone marrow- although studies suggest transdifferentiation extremely rare physiological conditions extensive regeneration myocardial infarcts reported recently direct stem cell injection prompting several clinical trials used cardiomyocyte-restricted ubiquitously expressed reporter transgenes track fate haematopoietic stem cells transplants normal injured adult mouse hearts transdifferentiation cardiomyocytes detectable using genetic techniques follow cell fate stem-cell-engrafted hearts showed overt increase cardiomyocytes compared sham-engrafted hearts results indicate haematopoietic stem cells readily acquire cardiac phenotype raise cautionary note clinical studies infarct repair
