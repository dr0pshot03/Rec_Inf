geological record ocean acidification
ocean acidification may severe consequences marine ecosystems however assessing future impact difficult laboratory experiments field observations limited reduced ecologic complexity sample period respectively contrast geological record contains long-term evidence variety global environmental perturbations including ocean acidification plus associated biotic responses review events exhibiting evidence elevated atmospheric co2 global warming ocean acidification past similar million years earths history contemporaneous extinction evolutionary turnover among marine calcifiers although similarities exist past event perfectly parallels future projections terms disrupting balance ocean carbonate chemistry-a consequence unprecedented rapidity co2 release currently taking place
