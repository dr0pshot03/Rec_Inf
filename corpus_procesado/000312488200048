dynamical age differences among coeval star clusters revealed blue stragglers 
globular star clusters formed cosmic time may evolved rather differently dynamical point viewbecause evolution depends internal environment variety processes tend progressively segregate stars massive average towards cluster centre1 therefore clusters chronological age may reached quite different stages dynamical history may different dynamical ages blue straggler stars masses greater2 turn-off point main sequence therefore must result either collision34 mass-transfer event5- among massive luminous objects old clusters can used test particles probe dynamical evolution report globular clusters can grouped distinct families basis radial distribution blue stragglers grouping corresponds well effective ranking dynamical stage reached stellar systems thereby permitting direct measure cluster dynamical age purely observed properties
