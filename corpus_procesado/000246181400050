specialized inhibitory synaptic actions nearby neocortical pyramidal neurons
found mouse visual cortex action potentials generated single layer-/ pyramidal excitatory neuron can reliably evoke large constant-latency inhibitory postsynaptic currents nearby pyramidal cells effect mediated axo-axonic ionotropic glutamate receptor-mediated excitation nerve terminals inhibitory interneurons connect target pyramidal cells therefore individual cortical excitatory neurons can generate inhibition independently somatic firing inhibitory interneurons
