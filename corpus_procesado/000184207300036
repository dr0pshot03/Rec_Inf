separation metallic semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotubes 
developed method separate metallic semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotubes suspension using alternating current dielectrophoresis method takes advantage difference relative dielectric constants two species respect solvent resulting opposite movement metallic semiconducting tubes along electric field gradient metallic tubes attracted toward microelectrode array leaving semiconducting tubes solvent proof effectiveness separation given comparative raman spectroscopy study dielectrophoretically deposited tubes reference sample
