optimal isotope labelling nmr protein structure determinations 
nuclear-magnetic-resonance spectroscopy can determine three-dimensional structure proteins solution however potential limited difficulty interpreting nmr spectra presence broadened overlapping resonance lines low signal-to-noise ratios present stereo-array isotope labelling sail technique can overcome many problems applying complete stereospecific regiospecific pattern stable isotopes optimal regard quality information content resulting nmr spectra sail uses exclusively chemically enzymatically synthesized amino acids cell-free protein expression demonstrate -kda protein calmodulin -kda maltodextrin-binding protein sail offers sharpened lines spectral simplification without loss information ability rapidly collect structural restraints required solve high-quality solution structure proteins twice large commonly solved nmr thus makes large class proteins newly accessible detailed solution structure determination
