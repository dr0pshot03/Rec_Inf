lock key colloids
new functional materials can principle created using colloids self-assemble desired structure means programmable recognition binding scheme idea explored attaching programmed dna strands nanometre-- micrometre- sized particles using dna hybridization direct placement particles final assembly demonstrate alternative recognition mechanism directing assembly composite structures based particles complementary shapes system uses fischers lock-and-key principle employs colloidal spheres keys monodisperse colloidal particles spherical cavity locks bind spontaneously reversibly via depletion interaction lock-and-key binding specific controlled closely size spherical colloidal key particle matches radius spherical cavity lock particle strength binding can tuned adjusting solution composition temperature composite assemblies unique feature flexible bonds allowing us produce flexible dimeric trimeric tetrameric colloidal molecules well complex colloidal polymers expect lock-and-key recognition mechanism will find wider use means programming directing colloidal self-assembly
