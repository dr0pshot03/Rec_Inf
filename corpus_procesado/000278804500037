need maintain structural functional integrity evolving protein severely restricts repertoire acceptable amino-acid substitutions- however known whether restrictions impose global limit far homologous protein sequences can diverge explore limits protein evolution using sequence divergence data formulate computational approach study rate divergence distant protein sequences measure rate ancient proteins present last universal common ancestor show ancient proteins still diverging indicating ongoing expansion protein sequence universe slow rate divergence imposed sparseness functional protein sequences sequence space ruggedness protein fitness landscape: similar per cent sites accept amino-acid substitution given moment vast majority sites may eventually permitted evolve compensatory changes occur thus similar x yr enough reach limit divergent evolution proteins proteins limit sequence similarity imposed common function may exceed random sequences
