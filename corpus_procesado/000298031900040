energetics evolution human brain size 
human brain stands among mammals unusually large expensive-tissue hypothesis explains evolution proposing trade-off size brain digestive tract smaller expected primate body size although hypothesis widely accepted empirical support far equivocal test sample mammalian species including primates analysing brain size organ mass data found controlling fat-free body mass brain size negatively correlated mass digestive tract expensive organ thus refuting expensive-tissue hypothesis nonetheless consistent existence energy trade-offs brain size find size brains adipose depots negatively correlated mammals indicating encephalization fat storage compensatory strategies buffer starvation however two strategies can combined fat storage unduly hamper locomotor efficiency propose human encephalization made possible combination stabilization energy inputs redirection energy locomotion growth reproduction
