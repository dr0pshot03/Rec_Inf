aerobic microbial respiration million-year-old deep-sea red clay
microbial communities can subsist depth marine sediments without fresh supply organic matter millions years threshold sedimentation rates millimeter per years low rates microbial community metabolism north pacific gyre allow sediments remain oxygenated tens meters sea floor found oxygen respiration rates dropped micromoles o liter- year- near sediment-water interface micromoles o liter- year- meter depth within million-year-old sediment cell-specific respiration rate decreased depth stabilized around - femtomoles o cell- day- meters seafloor result indicated community size controlled rate carbon oxidation thereby low available energy flux
