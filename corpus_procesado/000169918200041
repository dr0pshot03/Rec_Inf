superconductivity nonmagnetic state iron pressure 
ferromagnetism superconductivity thought compete conventional superconductors although principle possible metal become superconductor non-magnetic state sufficiently low temperature pressures 10gpa iron known transform non-magnetic structure possibility superconductivity state predicted report iron indeed become superconducting temperatures k pressures gpa transition superconducting state confirmed drop resistivity observation meissner effect
