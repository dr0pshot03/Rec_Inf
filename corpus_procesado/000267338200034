high-resolution nmr magnetic fields unknown spatiotemporal variations 
nuclear magnetic resonance nmr experiments usually carried homogeneous magnetic fields many cases however high-resolution spectra virtually impossible obtain inherent heterogeneity samples living organisms investigation well poor homogeneity magnets particularly bulky samples must placed outside bores unstable power supplies vibrations arising cooling can lead field fluctuations time well space show high-resolution nmr spectra can obtained inhomogeneous fields unknown spatiotemporal variations method based coherence transfer spins can accommodate spatial inhomogeneities least gauss per centimeter temporal fluctuations slower hertz
