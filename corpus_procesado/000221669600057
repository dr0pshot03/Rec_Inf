regeneration male germline stem cells spermatogonial dedifferentiation vivo 
although ability engrafted stem cells regenerate tissue received much attention molecular mechanisms controlling regeneration poorly understood drosophila male germline local activation janus kinase-signal transducer activator transcription jak-stat pathway maintains stem cells germline stem cells lacking jak-stat signaling differentiate spermatogonia without self-renewal conditionally manipulating jak-stat signaling find spermatogonia initiated differentiation undergoing limited mitotic transit-amplifying divisions can repopulate niche revert stem cell identity thus appropriate microenvironment transit-amplifying cells dedifferentiate becoming functional stem cells tissue regeneration
