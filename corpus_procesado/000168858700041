coherent transfer cooper pairs movable grain
superconducting circuits incorporate josephson junctions considerable experimental theoretical interest particularly context quantum computing- nanometre-sized superconducting grain commonly referred cooper-pair box connected reservoir josephson junction important example system although grain contains large number electrons experimentally demonstrated states given superposition two charge states differing 2e e electronic charge coupling charge transfer mechanical motion nanometre-sized structures also received considerable attention- demonstrate theoretically movable cooper-pair box oscillating periodically two remote superconducting electrodes can serve mediator josephson coupling leading coherent transfer cooper pairs electrodes magnitude direction resulting josephson current can controlled externally applied electrostatic fields
