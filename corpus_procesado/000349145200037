asynchronous rotation earth-mass planets habitable zone lower-mass stars
planets habitable zone lower-mass stars often assumed state tidally synchronized rotation considerably affect putative habitability although thermal tides cause venus rotate retrogradely simple scaling arguments tend attribute peculiarity massive venusian atmosphere using global climate model show even relatively thin atmosphere can drive terrestrial planets rotation away synchronicity derive realistic atmospheric tide model predicts four asynchronous equilibrium spin states two stable amplitude thermal tide exceeds threshold met habitable earth-like planets bar atmosphere around stars massive similar solar mass thus many recently discovered terrestrial planets exhibit asynchronous spin-orbit rotation even thin atmosphere
