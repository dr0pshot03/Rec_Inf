4d electron tomography
electron tomography provides three-dimensional 3d imaging noncrystalline crystalline equilibrium structures well elemental volume composition materials biological specimens including viruses cells report development 4d electron tomography integrating fourth dimension time resolution 3d spatial resolution obtained complete tilt series 2d projections object different time frames tomograms constitute movie object motion thus enabling studies nonequilibrium structures transient processes method demonstrated using carbon nanotubes bracelet-like ring structure 4d tomograms display different modes motion breathing wiggling resonance frequencies megahertz applications can now make use full space-time range nanometer-femtosecond resolution ultrafast electron tomography
