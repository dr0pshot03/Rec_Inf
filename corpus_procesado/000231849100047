extreme oxygen isotope ratios early solar system 
origins building blocks solar system can studied using isotopic composition early planetary meteoritic material oxygen isotopes planetary materials show variations per cent level related mass isotopes rather result mixture components different nucleosynthetic chemical origins- isotopic variations reaching orders magnitude minute meteoritic grains usually attributed stellar nucleosynthesis birth solar system whereby different grains contributed different stars report discovery abundant silica-rich grains embedded meteoritic organic matter extreme o-/o o-/o ratios observed similar - together solar silicon isotopic composition o si isotopes indicate single nucleosynthetic process compositions can accounted one two processes: single exotic evolved star seeding young solar system irradiation circumsolar gas high energy particles accelerated active phase young sun favour latter interpretation observed compositions usually expected nucleosynthetic processes evolved stars whereas predicted selective trapping irradiation products
