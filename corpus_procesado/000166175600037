many-particle entanglement bose-einstein condensates 
possibility creating manipulating entangled states systems many particles significant interest quantum information processing; capability lead new applications rely basic principles quantum mechanics1 far four atoms entangled controlled way23 crucial requirement production entangled states can considered pure single-particle level bose-einstein condensates4- fulfil requirement; hence natural investigate whether can also used applications quantum information propose method achieve substantial entanglement large number atoms bose-einstein condensate single resonant laser pulse applied atoms condensate allowed evolve freely; latter stage collisional interactions produce entanglement atoms technique realizable present technology
