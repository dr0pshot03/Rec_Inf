many-particle entanglement bose-einstein condensates
possibility creating manipulating entangled states systems many particles significant interest quantum information processing capability lead new applications rely basic principles quantum mechanics far four atoms entangled controlled way crucial requirement production entangled states can considered pure single-particle level bose-einstein condensates- fulfil requirement hence natural investigate whether can also used applications quantum information propose method achieve substantial entanglement large number atoms bose-einstein condensate single resonant laser pulse applied atoms condensate allowed evolve freely latter stage collisional interactions produce entanglement atoms technique realizable present technology
