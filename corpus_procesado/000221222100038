active galactic nuclei agns display many energetic phenomena broad emission lines x-rays relativistic jets radio lobes originating matter falling onto supermassive black hole widely accepted orientation effects play major role explaining observational appearance agns seen certain directions circum-nuclear dust clouds block view central powerhouse indirect evidence suggests dust clouds form parsec-sized torus-shaped distribution explanation however remains unproved even largest telescopes able resolve dust structures report interferometric mid-infrared observations spatially resolve structures galaxy ngc observations reveal warm k dust structure parsec thick parsec diameter surrounding smaller hot structure configuration dust clouds collapse time much shorter active phase agn observation requires continual input kinetic energy cloud system source coexistent agn
