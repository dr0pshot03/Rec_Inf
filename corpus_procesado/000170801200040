mobilization drosophila transposon caenorhabditis elegans germ line
transposons enormously useful genetic analysis drosophila bacteria mutagenic insertions constitute molecular tags used rapidly clone mutated gene techniques especially advantageous nematode caenorhabditis elegans entire sequence genome determined several different types endogenous transposons present c elegans can mobilized mutator strains reviewed ref unfortunately use native transposons regulated transposition c elegans limited first strains contain multiple copies transposons thus new insertions provide unique tags second mutator strains tend activate transposition several classes transposons type transposon associated particular mutation known demonstrate drosophila mariner element mos1 can mobilized c elegans first efficient mobilization mos1 possible somatic cells second heritable insertions transposon can generated germ line third genes mutated insertion can rapidly identified using inverse polymerase chain reaction fourth insertions can subsequently remobilized generate deletion frameshift mutations imperfect excision
