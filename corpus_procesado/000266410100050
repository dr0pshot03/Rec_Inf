unstable tandem repeats promoters confer transcriptional evolvability
relative regions genome tandemly repeated dna sequences display greater propensity mutate search tandem repeats saccharomyces cerevisiae genome revealed nucleosome-free region directly upstream genes promoter region enriched repeats many % gene promoters contain tandem repeat sequences genes driven repeat-containing promoters show significantly higher rates transcriptional divergence variations repeat length result changes expression local nucleosome positioning tandem repeats variable elements promoters may facilitate evolutionary tuning gene expression affecting local chromatin structure
