myomaker membrane activator myoblast fusion muscle formation 
fusion myoblasts essential formation multi-nucleated muscle fibres however identity muscle-specific proteins directly govern fusion process mammals remained elusive identify muscle-specific membrane protein named myomaker controls myoblast fusion myomaker expressed cell surface myoblasts fusion downregulated thereafter overexpression myomaker myoblasts markedly enhances fusion genetic disruption myomaker mice causes perinatal death due absence multi-nucleated muscle fibres remarkably forced expression myomaker fibroblasts promotes fusion myoblasts demonstrating direct participation protein fusion process pharmacological perturbation actin cytoskeleton abolishes activity myomaker consistent previous studies implicating actin dynamics myoblast fusion findings reveal long-sought myogenic fusion protein controls mammalian myoblast fusion provide new insights molecular underpinnings muscle formation
