distillation volatility ionic liquids 
widely believed defining characteristic ionic liquids low-temperature molten salts exert measurable vapour pressure hence distilled demonstrate unfounded many ionic liquids can distilled low pressure without decomposition ionic liquids represent matter solely composed ions perceived non-volatile substances last decade interest field ionic liquids burgeoned producing wealth intellectual technological challenges opportunities production new chemical extractive processes- fuel cells batteries new composite materials much potential underpinned presumed involatility characteristic however can severely restrict attainability high purity levels ionic liquids contain poorly volatile components recycling schemes well excluding use gas-phase processes anticipate demonstration selected families commonly used aprotic ionic liquids can distilled degrees c low pressure concomitant recovery significant amounts pure substance will permit currently excluded applications realized
