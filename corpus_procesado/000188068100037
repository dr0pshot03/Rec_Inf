probable observation supersolid helium phase 
liquid cooled k undergoes phase transition-bose-einstein condensation-and becomes superfluid zero viscosity state can flow without dissipation even pores atomic dimensions although intuitive associate superflow liquid phase proposed theoretically- superflow can also occur solid phase he- owing quantum mechanical fluctuations delocalized vacancies defects expected present crystalline solid he- even limit zero temperature zero-point vacancies can principle allow appearance superfluidity solid however spite many attempts supersolid phase yet observed bulk solid he- report torsional oscillator measurements solid helium confined porous medium configuration likely heavily populated vacancies bulk helium find abrupt drop rotational inertia confined solid certain critical temperature likely interpretation inertia drop entry supersolid phase confirmed results show three states matter-gas liquid solid-can undergo bose einstein condensation
