molecular editing cellular responses high-affinity receptor ige 
cellular responses elicited cell surface receptors differ according stimulus strength investigated high-affinity receptor immunoglobulin e ige modulates response mast cells high-or low-affinity stimulus high-and low-affinity stimuli elicited similar receptor phosphorylation; however differences observed receptor cluster size mobility distribution cells effector responses low-affinity stimulation increased receptor association src family kinase fgr shifted signals adapter lat1 related adapter lat2 lat1-dependent calcium signals required mast cell degranulation dampened role lat2 chemokine production enhanced altering immune cell recruitment site inflammation findings uncover receptor discrimination stimulus strength can interpreted distinct vivo outcomes
