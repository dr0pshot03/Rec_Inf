regulation hypoxia-inducible factor alpha signaling stress-responsive deacetylase sirtuin 
survive hostile environments organisms activate stress-responsive transcriptional regulators coordinately increase production protective factors hypoxia changes cellular metabolism thus activates redox-sensitive well oxygen-dependent signal transducers demonstrate sirtuin sirt1 redox-sensing deacetylase selectively stimulates activity transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor alpha hif- alpha hypoxia effect sirt1 hif- alpha required direct interaction proteins intact deacetylase activity sirt1 select lysine residues hif- alpha acetylated hypoxia confer repression sirt1 augmentation small-molecule inhibitors cultured cells mice decreasing increasing sirt1 activity levels affected expression hif- alpha target gene erythropoietin accordingly thus sirt1 promotes hif- signaling hypoxia likely environmental stresses
