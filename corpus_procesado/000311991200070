acute inflammation initiates regenerative response adult zebrafish brain
zebrafish regenerates brain injury hence useful model organism study mechanisms enabling regenerative neurogenesis poorly manifested mammals yet signaling mechanisms initiating regenerative response fish unknown using cerebroventricular microinjection immunogenic particles immunosuppression assays showed inflammation required sufficient enhancing proliferation neural progenitors subsequent neurogenesis activating injury-induced molecular programs can observed traumatic brain injury also identified cysteinyl leukotriene signaling essential component inflammation regenerative process adult zebrafish brain thus results demonstrate zebrafish contrast mammals inflammation positive regulator neuronal regeneration central nervous system
