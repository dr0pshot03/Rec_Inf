systems approach measuring binding energy landscapes transcription factors 
major goal systems biology predict function biological networks although network topologies successfully determined many cases quantitative parameters governing networks generally measuring affinities molecular interactions high-throughput format remains problematic especially transient low-affinity interactions describe high-throughput microfluidic platform measures properties basis mechanical trapping molecular interactions platform characterized dna binding energy landscapes four eukaryotic transcription factors landscapes used test basic assumptions transcription factor binding predict vivo function
