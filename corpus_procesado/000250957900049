fast-forward playback recent memory sequences prefrontal cortex sleep 
previously shown hippocampus brain areas patterns firing-rate correlations neurons rat medial prefrontal cortex repetitive sequence task preserved subsequent sleep suggesting waking patterns reactivated found sleep reactivation spatiotemporal patterns coherent across network compressed time factor thus behavioral constraints removed brains intrinsic processing speed may much faster real time given recent evidence implicating medial prefrontal cortex retrieval long-term memories observed replay may play role process memory consolidation
