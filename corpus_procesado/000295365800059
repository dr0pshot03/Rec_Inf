grk2-dependent s1pr1 desensitization required lymphocytes overcome attraction blood
lymphocytes egress lymphoid organs response sphingosine--phosphate s1p minutes later migrate blood tissue s1p gradient mechanisms facilitating cell movement gradient defined show heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding protein-coupled receptor kinase grk2 functions down-regulation s1p receptor s1pr1 blood-exposed lymphocytes t b cell movement blood lymph nodes reduced absence grk2 restored s1p-deficient mice spleen b cell movement blood-rich marginal zone follicles disrupted grk2 deficiency mutation s1pr1 desensitization motif moreover delivery systemic antigen follicles impaired thus grk2-dependent s1pr1 desensitization allows lymphocytes escape circulatory fluids migrate lymphoid tissues
