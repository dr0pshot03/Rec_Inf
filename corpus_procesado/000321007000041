intrinsically disordered protein threads bacterial outer-membrane porin ompf
porins beta-barrel outer-membrane proteins small solutes metabolites diffuse also exploited cell death studied bacteriocin colicin e9 cole9 assembles cytotoxic translocon surface escherichia coli incorporates trimeric porin ompf formation translocon involved cole9s unstructured n-terminal domain threading opposite directions two ompf subunits capturing target tolb side membrane fixed orientation triggers colicin import thus intrinsically disordered protein can tunnel narrow pores oligomeric porin deliver epitope signal cell initiate cell death
