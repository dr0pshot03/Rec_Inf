microscopic mechanisms equilibrium melting solid 
melting solid like first-order phase transitions exhibits intrinsic time-scale disparity: time spent system metastable states orders magnitude longer transition times states using rare-event sampling techniques find melting representative solids-here copper aluminum-occurs via multiple competing pathways involving formation migration point defects dislocations path characterized multiple barrier-crossing events arising multiple metastable states within solid basin temperatures approaching superheating melting becomes single barrier-crossing process limit superheating melting mechanism driven vibrational instability findings reveal importance nonlocal behavior suggesting revision perspective classical nucleation theory
