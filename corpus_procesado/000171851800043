sea level rise past years determined satellite situ observations
+/ millimeter per year global mean sea level rise observed topex/poseidon satellite fully explained thermal expansion oceans period sea level rise derived tide gauge data agrees well thermal expansion computed locations however find subsampling thermosteric sea level usual tide gauge positions leads thermosteric sea level rise twice large true global mean possible consequence 20th century sea level rise estimated tide gauge records may overestimated
