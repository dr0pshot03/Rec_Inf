escherichia coli k undergoes adaptive evolution achieve silico predicted optimal growth 
annotated genome sequences can used reconstruct whole-cell metabolic networks- metabolic networks can modelled analysed computed study complex biological functions- particular constraints-based silico models used calculate optimal growth rates common carbon substrates results found consistent experimental data many conditions optimal biological functions acquired evolutionary process thus incorrect predictions silico models based optimal performance criteria may due incomplete adaptive evolution conditions examined escherichia coli k mg1655 grows sub-optimally glycerol sole carbon source show placed growth selection pressure growth rate e coli glycerol reproducibly evolved days generations sub-optimal value optimal growth rate predicted whole-cell silico model results open possibility using adaptive evolution entire metabolic networks realize metabolic states determined priori based silico analysis
