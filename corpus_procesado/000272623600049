cell-specific information processing segregating populations eph receptor ephrin-expressing cells
cells self-organizing properties control behavior complex tissues contact cells expressing either b-type eph receptors transmembrane ephrin ligands initiates bidirectional signals regulate cell positioning however simultaneously investigating information processed two interacting cell types remains challenge implemented proteomic strategy systematically determine cell-specific signaling networks underlying ephb2-and ephrin-b1-controlled cell sorting quantitative mass spectrometric analysis mixed populations ephb2-and ephrin-b1-expressing cells labeled different isotopes revealed cell-specific tyrosine phosphorylation events functional associations phosphotyrosine signaling networks cell sorting established small interfering rna screening data-driven network modeling revealed signaling mixed ephb2-and ephrin-b1-expressing cells asymmetric distinct cell types use different tyrosine kinases targets process signals induced cell-cell contact provide systems cell-specific network models contact-initiated signaling two distinct cell types
