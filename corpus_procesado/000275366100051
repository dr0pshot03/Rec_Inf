salt taste mammals can trigger two divergent behavioural responses general concentrated saline solutions elicit robust behavioural aversion whereas low concentrations nacl typically attractive particularly sodium depletion- notably attractive salt pathway selectively responsive sodium inhibited amiloride whereas aversive one functions nonselective detector wide range salts-- amiloride potent inhibitor epithelial sodium channel enac enac proposed function component salt-taste-receptor system- previously showed four five basic taste qualities-sweet sour bitter umami-are mediated separate taste-receptor cells trcs tuned single taste modality wired elicit stereotypical behavioural responses- show sodium sensing also mediated dedicated population trcs taste cells express epithelial sodium channel enac mediate behavioural attraction nacl genetically engineered mice lacking enac alpha trcs produced animals exhibiting complete loss salt attraction sodium taste responses together studies substantiate independent cellular substrates five basic taste qualities validate essential role enac sodium taste mice
