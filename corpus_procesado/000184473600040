conserved domain axonal targeting kv1 shaker voltage-gated potassium channels 
axonal voltage-gated potassium kv1 channels regulate action-potential invasion hence transmitter release although evolutionarily conserved mediates axonal targeting known found kv1 axonal targeting required t1 tetramerization domain fused unpolarized cd4 dendritic transferrin receptor t1 promoted axonal surface expression moreover t1 mutations eliminating kvbeta association compromised axonal targeting surface expression cd4-t1 fusion proteins thus proper association kvbeta kv1 t1 domain essential axonal targeting
