structural basis non-coding rna rsmz acting protein sponge 
microrna protein sequestration non-coding rnas ncrnas recently generated much interest bacterial csr/rsm system considered general global post-transcriptional regulatory system responsible bacterial virulence ncrnas csrb rsmz activate translation initiation sequestering homodimeric csra-type proteins ribosome-binding site subset messenger rnas however mechanism ncrna-mediated protein sequestration understood molecular level show pseudomonas fluorescens rsme protein dimers assemble sequentially specifically cooperatively onto ncrna rsmz within narrow affinity range assembly yields two different native ribonucleoprotein structures using powerful combination nuclear magnetic resonance electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy elucidate -kilodalton solution structures thereby revealing molecular mechanism sequestration process rsme binding protects ncrna rnase e degradation overall findings suggest rsmz well-tuned sequester store release rsme therefore can viewed ideal protein sponge
