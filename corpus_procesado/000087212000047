chromosomal evolution saccharomyces 
chromosomal speciation model invokes chromosomal rearrangements primary cause reproductive isolation1 heterozygous carrier chromosomes bearing reciprocal translocations mis-segregate meiosis resulting reduced fertility complete sterility thus chromosomal rearrangements act post-zygotic isolating mechanism reproductive isolation yeast due post-zygotic barriers many species mate successfully hybrids sterile23 reciprocal translocations thought main form large-scale rearrangement since hypothesized duplication whole yeast genome years ago45 test chromosomal speciation model yeast characterized chromosomal translocations among genomes six closely related species saccharomyces sensu stricto complex6 show rearrangements occurred closely related species whereas distant ones colinear genomes thus chromosomal rearrangements prerequisite speciation yeast rate formation translocations constant rearrangements appear result ectopic recombination ty elements repeated sequences
