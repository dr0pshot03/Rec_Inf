eye-specific effects binocular rivalry human lateral geniculate nucleus 
dissimilar images presented two eyes compete perceptual dominance image visible turn seconds suppressed binocular rivalry associated relative suppression local eye-based representations- can also modulated high-level influences perceptual grouping however currently unclear early visual processing suppression eye-based signals can occur use high-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging fmri conjunction new binocular rivalry stimulus show signals recorded human lateral geniculate nucleus lgn exhibit eye-specific suppression rivalry regions lgn show strong eye-preference independently show strongly reduced activity binocular rivalry stimulus presented preferred eye perceptually suppressed human lgn thus earliest stage visual processing reflects eye-specific dominance suppression
