genes circuits precision therapies autism related neurodevelopmental disorders 
research genetics neurodevelopmental disorders autism suggests several hundred genes likely risk factors disorders heterogeneity presents challenge opportunity time although exact identity many genes remains discovered genes identified date encode proteins play roles certain conserved pathways: protein synthesis transcriptional epigenetic regulation synaptic signaling next generation research neurodevelopmental disorders must address neural circuitry underlying behavioral symptoms comorbidities cell types playing critical roles circuits common intercellular signaling pathways link diverse genes results clinical trials mixed far can leverage heterogeneity neurodevelopmental disorders precision medicine will mechanism-based therapeutics disorders start unlock success
