stepwise protein-mediated rna folding directs assembly telomerase ribonucleoprotein
telomerase essential cellular ribonucleoprotein rnp solves end replication problem maintains chromosome stability adding telomeric dna termini linear chromosomes- genetic mutations abrogate normal assembly telomerase rnp cause human disease therefore fundamental medical importance decipher cellular strategies telomerase biogenesis will require new insights specific interactions occur precise order along rnp assembly pathway use single-molecule approach dissect individual assembly steps telomerase direct observation complex formation real time revealed two sequential steps protein-induced rna folding establishing hierarchical rnp assembly mechanism: interaction telomerase holoenzyme protein p65 induces structural rearrangement telomerase rna turn directs binding telomerase reverse transcriptase form functional ternary complex hierarchical assembly process facilitated evolutionarily conserved structural motif within rna results identify rna folding pathway telomerase biogenesis define mechanism action essential telomerase holoenzyme protein
