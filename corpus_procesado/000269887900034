anomalous basaltic meteorite innermost main belt 
triangulated observations fireballs allow us determine orbits fall positions meteorites great majority basaltic meteorites derived asteroid vesta report recent fall orbital properties oxygen isotope composition suggest distinct parent body although orbit almost entirely contained within earths orbit modeling indicates originated innermost main belt meteorite parent body likely classified v-type asteroid v-type precursors basaltic meteorites unrelated vesta may reside inner main belt starting location agreement predictions planetesimal evolution model postulates formation differentiated asteroids terrestrial planet region surviving fragments concentrated innermost main belt
