adaptive coding reward value dopamine neurons
important animals estimate value rewards accurately possible number potential reward values large necessary brains limited resources allocated discriminate better among likely reward outcomes expense less likely outcomes found midbrain dopamine neurons rapidly adapted information provided reward-predicting stimuli responses shifted relative expected reward value gain adjusted variance reward value way dopamine neurons maintained reward sensitivity large range reward values
