emulating membrane protein evolution rational design
integral membrane proteins evolve size complexity using small multidrug-resistance protein emre escherichia coli model experimentally demonstrated evolution membrane proteins composed two homologous oppositely oriented domains can occur small number steps: original dual-topology protein evolves gene-duplication event heterodimer formed two oppositely oriented monomers simple evolutionary pathway can explain frequent occurrence membrane proteins internal pseudo-two-fold symmetry axis plane membrane
