spontaneous emergence cell polarity
diverse cell polarity networks require positive feedback locally amplifying distributions signalling molecules plasma membrane additional mechanisms directed transport coupled inhibitors proposed required reinforcing unique axis polarity analyse simple model positive feedback strong analogy stepping stone model population genetics single species diffusible membrane-bound signalling molecules can self-recruit cytoplasmic pool identify intrinsic stochastic mechanism positive feedback alone sufficient account spontaneous establishment single site polarity find polarization frequency inverse dependence number signalling molecules: frequency polarization decreases number molecules becomes large experimental observation polarizing cdc42 budding yeast consistent prediction work suggests positive feedback can work alone additional mechanisms create robust cell polarity
