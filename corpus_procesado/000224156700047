pack-mule transposable elements mediate gene evolution plants
mutator-like transposable elements mules found many eukaryotic genomes especially prevalent higher plants- maize rice arabidopsis mules shown carry fragments cellular genes- chimaeric elements called pack-mules study abundance mules rice availability genome sequence permitted systematic analysis prevalence nature pack-mules entire genome report pack-mules rice containing fragments derived cellular genes pack-mules frequently contain fragments multiple chromosomal loci fused form new open reading frames expressed chimaeric transcripts % pack-mules represented collections complementary dna functional analysis amino acid sequences proteomic data indicate captured gene fragments might functional comparison cellular genes pack-mule counterparts indicates fragments genomic dna captured rearranged amplified millions years given abundance pack-mules rice widespread occurrence mules characterized plant genomes gene fragment acquisition pack-mules might represent important new mechanism evolution genes higher plants
