trf2 associates dref directs promoter-selective gene expression drosophila 
drosophila tata-box-binding protein tbp-related factor trf2 member family tbp-related factors present metazoan organisms recent evidence suggests trf2s required proper embryonic development differentiation1- however true target promoters mechanisms trf2 operates control transcription remain elusive report antibody affinity purification drosophila trf2-containing complex contains components nucleosome remodelling factor nurf chromatin remodelling complex well dna replication-related element dre-binding factor dref latter finding led us potential target genes containing trf2-responsive promoters used combination vitro vivo assays show dref-containing trf2 complex directs core promoter recognition proliferating cell nuclear antigen pcna gene also identified additional trf2-responsive target genes involved dna replication cell proliferation data suggest trf2 functions core promoter-selectivity factor responsible coordinating transcription subset genes drosophila
