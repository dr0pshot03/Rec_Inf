application marcus cross relation hydrogen atom transfer reactions 
transfer hydrogen atom-a proton electron-is fundamental process chemistry biology variety hydrogen atom transfer reactions involving iron complexes phenols hydroxylamines buooh-bu-t toluene related radicals shown follow marcus cross relation thus marcus theory formalism based ground-state energetics self-exchange rates originally developed electron transfer processes also valuable hydrogen atom transfer compounds undergo slow proton transfer c-h bonds slow electron transfer cobalt complexes also undergo slow hydrogen atom transfer limitations approach also discussed
