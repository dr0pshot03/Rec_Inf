initiation complex structure promoter proofreading 
initiation transcription rna polymerase ii multistage process x-ray crystal structures transcription complexes containing short rnas reveal three structural states: one -nucleotide rnas -end rna detectable; second state -nucleotide rnas rna-dna hybrid grossly distorted conformation; third state rnas nucleotides longer essentially stable elongating complex transition first second state correlates markedly reduced frequency abortive initiation transition second third state correlates partial "bubble collapse" promoter escape polymerase structure permissive abortive initiation thereby setting lower limit polymerase-promoter complex lifetime allowing dissociation nonspecific complexes abortive initiation may viewed promoter proofreading structural transitions checkpoints promoter control
