diversity human copy number variation multicopy genes 
copy number variants affect disease normal phenotypic variation lying within heavily duplicated highly identical sequence difficult assay analyzing short-read mapping depth human genomes demonstrated accurate estimation absolute copy number duplications small kilobase pairs ranging copies identified million singly unique nucleotide positions informative distinguishing specific copies used genotype copy content specific paralogs within highly duplicated gene families data identify human-specific expansions genes associated brain development reveal extensive population genetic diversity detect signatures consistent gene conversion human species approach makes similar genes accessible genetic studies disease association
