nucleosomes suppress spontaneous mutations base-specifically eukaryotes
unknown composition structure dna within cell affect spontaneous mutations theory suggests eukaryotic genomes nucleosomal dna undergoes fewer c > t mutations suppressed cytosine hydrolytic deamination relative nucleosome-depleted dna comparative genomic analyses mutation accumulation experiment showed nucleosome occupancy nearly eliminated cytosine deamination resulting similar % decrease c > t mutation rate nucleosomal dna furthermore rates g > t > t mutations also twofold suppressed nucleosomes basis results conclude nucleosome-dependent mutation spectra affect eukaryotic genome structure evolution may implications understanding origin mutations cancers induced pluripotent stem cells
