social feeding caenorhabditis elegans induced neurons detect aversive stimuli 
natural caenorhabditis elegans isolates exhibit either social solitary feeding bacteria show social feeding induced nociceptive neurons detect adverse stressful conditions ablation nociceptive neurons ash adl transforms social animals solitary feeders social feeding probably due sensation noxious chemicals ash adl neurons; requires genes ocr- osm- encode trp-related transduction channels odr- odr- required localize sensory chemoreceptors cilia sensory neurons may suppress social feeding social feeding ocr- odr- mutants restored mutations osm- gene required development ciliated sensory neurons data suggest model regulation social feeding opposing sensory inputs: aversive inputs nociceptive neurons promote social feeding whereas antagonistic inputs neurons express osm- inhibit aggregation
