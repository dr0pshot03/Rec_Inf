sound isolation giant linear nonreciprocity compact acoustic circulator
acoustic isolation nonreciprocal sound transmission highly desirable many practical scenarios may realized nonlinear magneto-acoustic effects price high power levels impractically large volumes contrast nonreciprocal electromagnetic propagation commonly achieved based zeeman effect modal splitting ferromagnetic atoms induced magnetic bias introduce acoustic analog phenomenon subwavelength meta-atom consisting resonant ring cavity biased circulating fluid resulting angular momentum bias splits rings azimuthal resonant modes producing giant acoustic nonreciprocity compact device applied concept build linear magnetic-free circulator airborne sound waves observing decibel nonreciprocal isolation audible frequencies
