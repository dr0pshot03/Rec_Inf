radiationless electromagnetic interference: evanescent-field lenses perfect focusing
diffraction restricts ability electromagnetic devices image selectively target objects smaller wavelength describe planar subwavelength structures capable focusing well beyond diffraction limit operating arbitrary frequencies structure design related fresnel plates forces input field converge spot focal plane however unlike diffraction-limited zone plates focusing results interference traveling waves subwavelength plates control near field superlensing properties originate static form interference practical implementations plates hold promise near-field data storage noncontact sensing imaging nanolithography applications
