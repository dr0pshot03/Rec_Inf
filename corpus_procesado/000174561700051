control synaptic strength glial tnf alpha 
activity-dependent modulation synaptic efficacy brain contributes neural circuit development experience-dependent plasticity although glia affected activity ensheathe synapses influence synaptic strength largely ignored show protein produced glia tumor necrosis factor alpha tnfalpha enhances synaptic efficacy increasing surface expression ampa receptors preventing actions endogenous tnfalpha opposite effects thus continual presence tnfalpha required preservation synaptic strength excitatory synapses effects ampa receptor trafficking tnfalpha may play roles synaptic plasticity modulating responses neural injury
