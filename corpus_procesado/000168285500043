evidence pacific troposphere large global sources oxygenated organic compounds 
presence oxygenated organic compounds troposphere strongly influences key atmospheric processes oxygenated species example carriers reactive nitrogen easily photolysed producing free radicals--and influence oxidizing capacity ozone-forming potential atmosphere--and may also contribute significantly organic component aerosols knowledge distribution sources oxygenated organic compounds especially southern hemisphere limited characterize tropospheric composition oxygenated organic species using data recent airborne survey conducted tropical pacific ocean degrees n degrees s measurements dozen oxygenated chemicals carbonyls alcohols organic nitrates organic pernitrates peroxides along several c--c hydrocarbons reveal abundances oxygenated species extremely high collectively oxygenated species nearly five times abundant non-methane hydrocarbons southern hemisphere current atmospheric models unable correctly simulate findings suggesting large diffuse hitherto-unknown sources oxygenated organic compounds must therefore exist although origin sources still unclear suggest oxygenated species formed via oxidation hydrocarbons atmosphere photochemical degradation organic matter oceans direct emissions terrestrial vegetation
