light scattering determine relative phase two bose-einstein condensates 
demonstrated experimental technique based stimulated light scattering continuously sample relative phase two spatially separated bose-einstein condensates atoms phase measurement process created relative phase two condensates initial phase relation read phase monitored phase evolution technique used realize interferometry two trapped bose-einstein condensates without need splitting recombining atom cloud
