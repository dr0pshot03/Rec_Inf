reconstructing early evolution fungi using six-gene phylogeny 
ancestors fungi believed simple aquatic forms flagellated spores similar members extant phylum chytridiomycota chytrids current classifications assume chytrids form early-diverging clade within kingdom fungi imply single loss spore flagellum leading diversification terrestrial fungi develop phylogenetic hypotheses fungi using data six gene regions nearly species results indicate may least four independent losses flagellum kingdom fungi losses swimming spores coincided evolution new mechanisms spore dispersal aerial dispersal mycelial groups polar tube eversion microsporidia unicellular forms lack mitochondria enigmatic microsporidia seem derived endoparasitic chytrid ancestor similar rozella allomycis earliest diverging branch fungal phylogenetic tree
