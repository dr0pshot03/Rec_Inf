structural organization readily releasable pool synaptic vesicles
defining morphological feature chemical synapses vesicle cluster presynaptic nerve terminal generally assumed vesicles closest release sites recruited first nerve activity tested selectively labeling readily releasable pool vesicles released first physiological stimulation readily releasable vesicles clustered close presynaptic membrane instead dispersed almost randomly throughout vesicle cluster thus vesicles recruited according proximity release sites mobilized differently perhaps peeled surface cluster
