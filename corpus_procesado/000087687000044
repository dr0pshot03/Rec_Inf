step-by-step engineered multiparticle entanglement
quantum particles interacted generally remain entangled state correlated distance quantum-mechanical links can used transmit process information nonclassical ways implies programmable sequences operations generate analyze entanglement complex systems demonstrated procedure two atoms single-photon cavity mode engineering analyzing three-particle entangled state succession controlled steps address particles individually entangling procedure can principle operate larger numbers particles opening new perspectives fundamental tests quantum theory
