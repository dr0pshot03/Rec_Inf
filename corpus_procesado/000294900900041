trace metals biomarkers eumelanin pigment fossil record 
well-preserved fossils pivotal early bird nonavian theropod species provided unequivocal evidence feathers and/or downlike integuments recent studies reconstructed color basis melanosome structure however chemistry proposed melanosomes remained unknown applied synchrotron x-ray techniques several fossil extant organisms including confuciusornis sanctus order map characterize possible chemical residues melanin pigments results show trace metals copper present fossils organometallic compounds likely derived original eumelanin distribution compounds provides long-lived biomarker melanin presence density within range fossilized organisms metal zoning patterns may preserved long melanosome structures destroyed
