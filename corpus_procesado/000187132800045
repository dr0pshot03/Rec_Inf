optimization specificity cellular protein interaction network negative selection
proteins participate cellular signalling networks contain modular protein interaction domains multiple versions domains present within given organism: yeast proteome example contains different src homology sh3 domains raises potential problem crossreaction generally thought isolated domain ligand pairs lack sufficient information encode biologically unique interactions specificity instead encoded context interaction pairs presented show isolated peptide ligand yeast protein pbs2 recognizes biological partner sh3 domain sho1 near absolute specificity sh3 domain present yeast genome cross reacts pbs2 peptide vivo vitro high specificity however observed set non yeast sh3 domains pbs2 motif variants cross react sh3 domains confer fitness defect indicating pbs2 motif might optimized minimize interaction competing domains specifically found yeast system wide negative selection subtle powerful evolutionary mechanism optimize specificity within interaction network composed overlapping recognition elements
