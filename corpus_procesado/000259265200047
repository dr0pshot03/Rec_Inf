regulatory networks define phenotypic classes human stem cell lines
stem cells defined self renewing cell populations can differentiate multiple distinct cell types however hundreds different human cell lines embryonic fetal adult sources called stem cells even though range pluripotent cells typified embryonic stem cells capable virtually unlimited proliferation differentiation adult stem cell lines can generate far limited repertoire differentiated cell types rapid increase reports new sources stem cells anticipated value regenerative medicine highlighted need general reproducible method classification cells report creation analysis database global gene expression profiles call stem cell matrix enables classification cultured human stem cells context wide variety pluripotent multipotent differentiated cell types using unsupervised clustering method categorize collection similar cell samples discovered pluripotent stem cell lines group together whereas cell types including brain-derived neural stem cell lines diverse using bioinformatic analysis uncovered protein protein network plurinet shared pluripotent cells embryonic stem cells embryonal carcinomas induced pluripotent cells analysis published data showed plurinet seems common characteristic pluripotent cells including mouse embryonic stem induced pluripotent cells human oocytes results offer new strategy classifying stem cells support idea pluripotency self renewal tight control specific molecular networks
