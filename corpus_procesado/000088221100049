segment polarity network robust development module 
insects possess homologous segments segment specification differs radically among insect orders drosophila maternal morphogens control patterned activation gap genes encode transcriptional regulators shape patterned expression pair-rule genes patterning cascade takes place cellularization pair-rule gene products subsequently imprint segment polarity genes reiterated patterns thus defining primordial segments mechanism must greatly modified insect groups many segments emerge cellularization1 beetlesand parasitic wasps instance pair-rule homologues expressed patterns consistent roles segmentation patterns emerge within cellular fields2- contrast although locusts pair-rule homologues may control segmentation56 segment polarity genes interactions conserved37- perhaps segmentation modular module autonomously expressing characteristic intrinsic behaviour response transient stimuli evolution rearrange inputs modules without changing intrinsic behaviours suggest using computer simulations drosophila segment polarity genes constitute module module resistant variations kinetic constants govern behaviour
