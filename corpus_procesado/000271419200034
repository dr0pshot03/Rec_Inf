quantum gas microscope detecting single atoms hubbard-regime optical lattice 
recent years seen tremendous progress creating complex atomicmany-body quantum systems one approach use macroscopic effectively thermodynamic ensembles ultracold atoms create quantum gases strongly correlated states matter analyse bulk properties ensemble example bosonic fermionic atoms hubbard-regime optical lattice1- can used quantum simulations solid-state models6 opposite approach build microscopic quantum systems atom-by-atom complete control degrees freedom7- atoms ions act qubits allow realization quantum gates goal creating highly controllable quantum information systems now macroscopic microscopic strategies fairly disconnected present quantum gas microscope bridges two approaches realizing system atoms macroscopic ensemble detected individually complete set degrees freedom determined preparation measurement implementing high-resolution optical imaging system single atoms detected near-unity fidelity individual sites hubbard-regime optical lattice lattice generated projecting holographic mask imaging system arbitrary geometry chosen support strong tunnel coupling lattice sites strong on-site confinement approach can used directly detect strongly correlated states matter; context condensed matter simulation corresponds detection individual electrons simulated crystal also quantum gas microscope may enable addressing read-out large-scale quantum information systems based ultracold atoms
