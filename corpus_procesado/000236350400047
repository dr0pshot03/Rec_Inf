c-elegans stretch receptor neuron revealed mechanosensitive trp channel homologue
nematode caenorhabditis elegans commonly used genetic model organism dissecting integration sensory motor systems despite extensive genetic behavioural analyses led identification many genes neural circuits involved regulating c elegans locomotion behaviour remains unclear whether somatosensory feedback modulates motor output locomotion particular stretch receptors identified c elegans raising issue whether stretch-receptor-mediated proprioception used c elegans regulate locomotion behaviour characterized trp- c elegans homologue mechanosensitive trpn channel show trp mutant worms bend body abnormally exhibiting body posture distinct wild-type worms locomotion suggesting trp involved stretch-receptor-mediated proprioception show trp acts single neuron dva mediate function proprioception activity dva can stimulated body stretch dva positively negatively modulates locomotion providing unique mechanism whereby single neuron can fine-tune motor activity thus dva represents stretch receptor neuron regulates sensory motor integration c elegans locomotion
