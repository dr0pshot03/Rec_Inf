shatterproof mads-box genes control seed dispersal arabidopsis
fruit mediates maturation dispersal seeds complex structure unique flowering plants seed dispersal plants arabidopsis occurs process called fruit dehiscence pod shatter studies- focused identifying genes regulate process spite agronomic value controlling seed dispersal crop plants canola show closely related shatterproof shp1 shatterproof2 shp2 mads-box genes required fruit dehiscence arabidopsis moreover shp1 shp2 functionally redundant neither single mutant displays novel phenotype studies shp1 shp2 fruit plants constitutively expressing shp1 shp2 show two genes control dehiscence zone differentiation promote lignification adjacent cells results indicate analysis molecular events underlying fruit dehiscence may allow genetic manipulation pod shatter crop plants
