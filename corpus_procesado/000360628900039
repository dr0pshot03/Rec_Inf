sustainable fe-ppm pd nanoparticle catalysis suzuki-miyaura cross-couplings water 
todays use transition metal-catalyzed cross-coupling chemistry relies expensive quantities palladium pd report nanoparticles formed inexpensive fecl3 naturally contains parts-per-million ppm levels pd can catalyze suzuki-miyaura reactions including cases involve highly challenging reaction partners nanomicelles employed solubilize deliver reaction partners fe-ppm pd catalyst resulting carbon-carbon bond formation newly formed catalyst can isolated stored ambient temperatures aqueous reaction mixtures containing surfactant catalyst can recycled
