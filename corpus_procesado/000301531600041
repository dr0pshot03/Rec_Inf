laser scribing high-performance flexible graphene-based electrochemical capacitors
although electrochemical capacitors ecs also known supercapacitors ultracapacitors charge discharge faster batteries still limited low energy densities slow rate capabilities used standard lightscribe dvd optical drive direct laser reduction graphite oxide films graphene produced films mechanically robust show high electrical conductivity siemens per meter specific surface area square meters per gram can thus used directly ec electrodes without need binders current collectors case conventional ecs devices made electrodes exhibit ultrahigh energy density values different electrolytes maintaining high power density excellent cycle stability ecs moreover ecs maintain excellent electrochemical attributes high mechanical stress thus hold promise high-power flexible electronics
