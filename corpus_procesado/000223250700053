visual pattern recognition drosophila invariant retinal position
vision relies constancy mechanisms yet little understood difficult investigate freely moving organisms one mechanism translation invariance enables organisms recognize visual patterns independent region visual field originally seen tethered flies drosophila melanogaster flight simulator can recognize visual patterns eyes fixed space patterns can displayed defined parts visual field can tested translation invariance show flies recognize patterns retinal positions patterns presented
