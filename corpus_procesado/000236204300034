general strategies nanoparticle dispersion
traditionally dispersion particles polymeric materials proven difficult frequently results phase separation agglomeration show thermodynamically stable dispersion nanoparticles polymeric liquid enhanced systems radius gyration linear polymer greater radius nanoparticle dispersed nanoparticles swell linear polymer chains resulting polymer radius gyration grows nanoparticle volume fraction proposed entropically unfavorable process offset enthalpy gain due increase molecular contacts dispersed nanoparticle surfaces compared surfaces phase-separated nanoparticles even dispersed state thermodynamically stable may inaccessible unless correct processing strategy adopted particularly important case fullerene dispersion linear polymers
