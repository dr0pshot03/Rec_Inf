cysteine-clamp gene drives embryo polarity midge chironomus 
fruit fly drosophila head formation driven single gene bicoid generates head-to-tail polarity main embryonic axis bicoid deficiency results embryos tail-to-tail polarity head however insects lack bicoid molecular mechanism establishing head-to-tail polarity poorly understood identified gene establishes head-to-tail polarity mosquito-like midge chironomus riparius gene named panish encodes cysteine-clamp dna binding domain operates different mechanism bicoid finding combined observation phylogenetic distributions panish bicoid limited specific families flies reveals frequent evolutionary changes body axis determinants remarkable opportunity study gene regulatory network evolution
