assessing reliability calculated catalytic ammonia synthesis rates 
introduce general method estimating uncertainty calculated materials properties based density functional theory calculations illustrate approach calculation catalytic rate ammonia synthesis range transition-metal catalysts correlation errors density functional theory calculations shown play important role reducing predicted error calculated rates uncertainties depend strongly reaction conditions catalyst material relative rates different catalysts considerably better described absolute rates introduce approach incorporating uncertainty searching improved catalysts evaluating probability given catalyst better known standard
