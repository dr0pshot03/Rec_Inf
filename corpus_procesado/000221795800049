process controlling intracellular bacterial infections induced membrane injury
strategies inhibiting phagolysosome fusion essential intracellular survival replication many pathogens found lysosomal synaptotagmin syt vii required mechanism promotes phagolysosomal fusion limits intracellular growth pathogenic bacteria syt vii required form ca2+-dependent phagolysosome fusion analogous ca2+-regulated exocytosis lysosomes can triggered membrane injury bacterial type iii secretion systems permeabilize membranes cause ca2+ influx mammalian cells promote lysosomal exocytosis inhibit intracellular survival syt vii +/+ / cells thus lysosomal repair response can also protect cells pathogens trigger membrane permeabilization
