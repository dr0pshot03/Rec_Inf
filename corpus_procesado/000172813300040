folding-driven synthesis oligomers 
biological function biomacromolecules dna enzymes depends ability perform control molecular association catalysis self-replication chemical processes case proteins particular dependence functions three-dimensional protein conformation long known inspired development synthetic oligomers polymers capacity fold controlled manner- remains challenging design so-called foldamers capable inducing controlling chemical processes interactions show stability gained folding can used control synthesis oligomers short chain segments reversibly ligated imine metathesis reaction folding shifts ligation equilibrium- favour conformationally ordered sequences oligomers stable solution structures form preferentially crystallization previously used shift equilibrium order indirectly influence synthesis small molecules present approach selectively prepare macromolecules stable conformations directly connects folding synthesis emphasizing molecular function rather structure polymer synthesis
