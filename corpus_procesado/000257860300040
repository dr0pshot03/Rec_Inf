endoplasmic-reticulum stress inflammatory response 
endoplasmic reticulum responsible much cells protein synthesis folding also important role sensing cellular stress recently shown endoplasmic reticulum mediates specific set intracellular signalling pathways response accumulation unfolded misfolded proteins pathways collectively known unfolded-protein response new observations suggest unfolded-protein response can initiate inflammation coupling responses specialized cells tissues now thought fundamental pathogenesis inflammatory diseases knowledge gained emerging field will aid development therapies modulating cellular stress inflammation
