molecular ruler determines repeat length eukaryotic cilia flagella 
existence cellular structures specific size raises fundamental question biology: cells measure length one conceptual answer question molecular ruler examples rulers eukaryotes lacking work identified molecular ruler eukaryotic cilia flagella using cryo-electron tomography found fap59 fap172 form -nanometer nm-long complex chlamydomonas flagella absence complex disrupted -nm repeats axonemes furthermore lengthening fap59/ complex domain duplication resulted extension repeats nm well duplication specific axonemal components thus fap59/ complex molecular ruler determines -nm repeat length arrangements components cilia flagella
