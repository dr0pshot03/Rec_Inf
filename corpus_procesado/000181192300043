antibody multispecificity mediated conformational diversity
single antibody shown adopt different binding-site conformations thereby bind unrelated antigens analysis x-ray crystallography pre-steady-state kinetics revealed equilibrium different preexisting isomers one possessed promiscuous low-affinity binding site aromatic ligands including immunizing hapten subsequent induced-fit isomerization led high-affinity complexes deep narrow binding site protein antigen identified repertoire selection made use unrelated antibody isomer wide shallow binding site conformational diversity whereby one sequence adopts multiple structures multiple functions can increase effective size antibody repertoire may also lead autoimmunity allergy
