formation giant planets fragmentation protoplanetary disks 
evolution gravitationally unstable protoplanetary gaseous disks studied use three-dimensional smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations unprecedented resolution considered disks initial masses temperature profiles consistent inferred protosolar nebula protoplanetary disks show long-lasting self-gravitating protoplanets arise disk orbital periods cooling efficient enough maintain temperature close k resulting bodies masses orbital eccentricities similar detected extrasolar planets
