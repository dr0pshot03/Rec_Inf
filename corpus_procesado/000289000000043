microtomography partially molten rocks: three-dimensional melt distribution mantle peridotite
permeability upper mantle controls melt segregation beneath spreading centers reconciling contradictory geochemical geophysical observations ocean ridges requires better understanding transport properties partially molten rocks using x-ray synchrotron microtomography obtained three-dimensional data melt distribution mantle peridotite various melt fractions melt fractions low triple junctions along grain edges dominated melt network evidence abrupt change fundamental character melt extraction melt fraction increased porosity partially molten region beneath ocean ridges therefore controlled balance viscous compaction melting rate change melt topology
