decline subpolar north atlantic circulation 1990s
observations sea surface height reveal substantial changes occurred past decade mid high-latitude north atlantic ocean topex/poseidon altimeter data show subpolar sea surface height increased 1990s geostrophic velocity derived altimeter data exhibits declining subpolar gyre circulation combining data earlier satellites find subpolar circulation may weaker late 1990s late 1970s 1980s direct current-meter observations boundary current labrador sea support weakening circulation trend 1990s together hydrographic data show mid late 1990s decline extends deep water column analysis local surface forcing suggests 1990s buoyancy forcing dynamic effect consistent altimetric hydrographic observations: weak thermohaline forcing allows decay domed structure subpolar isopycnals weakening circulation
