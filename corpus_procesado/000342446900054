flexible energetics cheetah hunting strategies provide resistance kleptoparasitism 
population viability driven individual survival turn depends individuals balancing energy budgets carnivores may function close maximum sustained power outputs decreased food availability increased activity may render populations energetically vulnerable prey theft may compromise energetic budgets mesopredators cheetahs wild dogs susceptible competition larger carnivores show daily energy expenditure dee cheetahs similar size-based predictions positively related distance traveled theft % requires cheetahs hunt extra hour per day increasing dee just % therefore mesopredators energetically constrained direct competition factors increase dee increase travel may important population viability
