beta-catenin activation regulates tissue growth non-cell autonomously hair stem cell niche
wnt/beta-catenin signaling critical tissue regeneration however unclear beta-catenin controls stem cell behaviors coordinate organized growth using live imaging show activation beta-catenin specifically within mouse hair follicle stem cells generates new hair growth oriented cell divisions cellular displacement beta-catenin activation sufficient induce hair growth independently mesenchymal dermal papilla niche signals normally required hair regeneration wild-type cells co-opted new hair growths beta-catenin mutant cells non-cell autonomously activate wnt signaling within neighboring wild-type cells via wnt ligands study demonstrates mechanism wnt/beta-catenin signaling controls stem cell-dependent tissue growth non-cell autonomously advances understanding mechanisms drive coordinated regeneration
