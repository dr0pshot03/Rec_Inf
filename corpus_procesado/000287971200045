different b cell populations mediate early late memory endogenous immune response
memory b cells formed response microbial antigens provide immunity later infections however inability detect rare endogenous antigen-specific cells limits current understanding process using antigen-based technique enrich cells found immunization model protein generated b memory cells expressed isotype-switched immunoglobulins swig retained igm numerous igm+ cells longer lived swig+ cells however swig+ memory cells dominated secondary response capacity become activated presence neutralizing serum immunoglobulin thus propose memory relies swig+ cells disappear serum immunoglobulin falls low level case memory resides durable igm+ reserves
