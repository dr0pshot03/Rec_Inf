netrin controls colorectal tumorigenesis regulating apoptosis
expression protein dcc deleted colorectal cancer lost markedly reduced numerous cancers majority colorectal cancers due loss heterozygosity chromosome 18q therefore proposed tumour suppressor however rarity mutations found dcc lack cancer predisposition dcc mutant mice presence tumour suppressor genes 18q raised doubts function dcc tumour suppressor unlike classical tumour suppressors dcc shown induce apoptosis conditionally: functioning dependence receptor dcc induces apoptosis unless dcc engaged ligand netrin ref show inhibition cell death enforced expression netrin mouse gastrointestinal tract leads spontaneous formation hyperplastic neoplastic lesions moreover adenomatous polyposis coli mutant background associated adenoma formation enforced expression netrin engenders aggressive adenocarcinomatous malignancies data demonstrate netrin can promote intestinal tumour development probably regulating cell survival thus netrin receptor receptors function conditional tumour suppressors
