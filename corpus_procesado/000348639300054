structure activity tryptophan-rich tspo proteins 
translocator proteins tspos bind steroids porphyrins implicated many human diseases serve biomarkers therapeutic targets tspos tryptophan-rich sequences highly conserved bacteria mammals report crystal structures bacillus cereus tspo bctspo angstrom resolution including complex benzodiazepine-like inhibitor pk11195 also describe bctspo-mediated protoporphyrin ix ppix reactions including catalytic degradation previously undescribed heme derivative used structure-inspired mutations investigate reaction mechanisms showed tspos xenopus man similar ppix-directed activities although tspos regarded transporters catalytic activity ppix degradation suggests physiological importance tspos protection oxidative stress
