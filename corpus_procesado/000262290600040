genetic code supports targeted insertion two amino acids one codon
strict one one correspondence codons amino acids thought essential feature genetic code however report one codon can code two different amino acids choice inserted amino acid determined specific untranslated region structure location dual function codon within messenger rna mrna found codon uga specifies insertion selenocysteine cysteine ciliate euplotes crassus dual use codon can occur even within gene structural arrangements euplotes mrna preserve location dependent dual function uga expressed mammalian cells thus genetic code supports use one codon code multiple amino acids
