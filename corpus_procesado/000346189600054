ultrastable gold substrates electron cryomicroscopy
despite recent advances structures many proteins determined electron cryomicroscopy individual proteins move irradiation blurs images aligned calculate three-dimensional density much movement stems instabilities carbon substrates used support frozen samples microscope demonstrate gold specimen support nearly eliminates substrate motion irradiation increases subnanometer image contrast helices individual proteins resolved improvement determine structure apoferritin smooth octahedral shell alpha-helical subunits particularly difficult solve electron microscopy advance substrate design will enable solution currently intractable protein structures
