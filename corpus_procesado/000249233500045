p53 regulated lysine demethylase lsd1 
p53 tumour suppressor transcriptional activator regulated numerous post-translational modifications including lysine methylation12 histone lysine methylation recently shown reversible; however known whether nonhistone proteins substrates demethylation show human cells histone lysine-specific demethylase lsd1 refs interacts p53 repress p53-mediated transcriptional activation inhibit role p53 promoting apoptosis find vitro lsd1 removes monomethylation k370me1 dimethylation k370me2 k370 previously identified smyd2-dependent monomethylation site2 however vivo lsd1 shows strong preference reverse k370me2 performed distinct unknown methyltransferase results indicate k370me2 different role regulating p53 k370me1: k370me1 represses p53 function whereas k370me2 promotes association coactivator 53bp1 p53-binding protein tandem tudor domains 53bp1 lsd1 represses p53 function inhibition interaction p53 53bp1 observations show p53 dynamically regulated lysine methylation demethylation methylation status single lysine residue confers distinct regulatory output lysine methylation therefore provides similar regulatory complexity non-histone proteins histones
