ras-mapk-msk1 pathway modulates ataxin protein levels toxicity sca1
many neurodegenerative disorders alzheimers parkinsons polyglutamine diseases share common pathogenic mechanism: abnormal accumulation disease-causing proteins due either mutant proteins resistance degradation overexpression wild-type protein developed strategy identify therapeutic entry points neurodegenerative disorders screening genetic networks influence levels disease-driving proteins applied approach integrates parallel cell-based drosophila genetic screens spinocerebellar ataxia type sca1 disease caused expansion polyglutamine tract ataxin atxn1 approach revealed downregulation several components ras-mapk-msk1 pathway decreases atxn1 levels suppresses neurodegeneration drosophila mice importantly pharmacological inhibitors components pathway also decrease atxn1 levels suggesting components represent new therapeutic targets mitigating sca1 collectively data reveal new therapeutic entry points sca1 provide proof-of-principle tackling classes intractable neurodegenerative diseases
