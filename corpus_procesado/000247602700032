rapid formation supermassive black hole binaries galaxy mergers gas 
supermassive black holes smbhs ubiquitous component nuclei galaxies normally assumed merger two massive galaxies smbh binary will form shrink stellar gas dynamical processes ultimately coalesce emitting burst gravitational waves however far possible show two smbhs bind galaxy merger gas difficulty modeling wide range spatial scales report hydrodynamical simulations track formation smbh binary scales light years collision two spiral galaxies massive turbulent nuclear gaseous disk arises result galaxy merger black holes form eccentric binary disk less million years result gravitational drag gas rather stars
