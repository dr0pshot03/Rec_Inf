emergent genetic oscillations synthetic microbial consortium
challenge synthetic biology creation cooperative microbial systems exhibit population-level behaviors systems use cellular signaling mechanisms regulate gene expression across multiple cell types describe construction synthetic microbial consortium consisting two distinct cell types-an activator strain repressor strain strains produced two orthogonal cell-signaling molecules regulate gene expression within synthetic circuit spanning strains two strains generated emergent population-level oscillations cultured together certain network topologies two-strain circuit better maintaining robust oscillations others ability program population-level dynamics genetic engineering multiple cooperative strains points way toward engineering complex synthetic tissues organs multiple cell types
