hyperacute directional hearing microscale auditory system 
physics sound propagation imposes fundamental constraints sound localization: given frequency smaller receiver smaller available cues thus creation nanoscale acoustic microphones directional sensitivity difficult fly ormia ochracea possesses unusual ear largely overcomes physical constraints- attempts exploit principles derived o ochracea improved hearing aids now progress report o ochracea can behaviourally localize salient sound source precision equal humans despite small size minuscule interaural cues fly localizes sound sources within degrees azimuth flys eardrums less mm apart localization cues around ns directional information represented auditory system relative timing receptor responses two ears low-jitter phasic receptor responses pooled achieve hyperacute timecoding results demonstrate nanoscale/microscale directional microphones patterned o ochracea potential highly accurate directional sensitivity independent size notably fly performance dependent newly discovered set specific coding strategies employed nervous system
