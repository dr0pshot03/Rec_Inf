mean free path electron conduction metallic fullerenes 
electrical resistivity rho metal usually interpreted terms mean free path average distance l electron travels scattered temperature raised resistivity increases apparent mean free path correspondingly reduced semi-classical picture mean free path much shorter distance d two atoms confirmed many systems considered universal behaviour12 recently apparent exceptions found including alkali-doped fullerenes3- high-temperature superconductors however remains possibility systems exotic states small fraction conduction electrons contributing conductivity; mean free path correspondingly larger explain observed resistivity report model calculation electron conduction alkali-doped fullerenes electrons scattered intramolecular vibrations resistivity large temperatures implies l << d demonstrating fundamental principle requiring l greater similar d high temperatures semi-classical picture breaks electrons described quasiparticles
