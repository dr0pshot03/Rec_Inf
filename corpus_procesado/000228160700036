water content transition zone electrical conductivity wadsleyite ringwoodite
distribution water earths interior reflects way earth evolved important influence material properties minerals transition zone earths mantle similar similar km depth large water solubility- hence thought transition zone might act water reservoir water content transition zone exceeds critical value upwelling flow might result partial melting similar km affect distribution certain elements earth however amount water transition zone remained unknown determined effects water temperature electrical conductivity minerals wadsleyite ringwoodite infer water content transition zone find electrical conductivity minerals depends strongly water content weakly temperature comparing results geophysically inferred conductivity- infer water content mantle transition zone varies regionally value pacific estimated similar -2wt% values significantly exceed estimated critical water content upper mantle suggesting partial melting may indeed occur similar km depth least region
