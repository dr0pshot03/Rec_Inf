yeast reveal druggable rsp5/nedd4 network ameliorates alpha-synuclein toxicity neurons
alpha-synuclein alpha-syn small lipid-binding protein implicated several neurodegenerative diseases including parkinsons disease whose pathobiology conserved yeast man therapies targeting underlying cellular pathologies indeed major neurodegenerative disease using unbiased phenotypic screens alternative target-based approaches discovered n-aryl benzimidazole nab strongly selectively protected diverse cell types alpha-syn toxicity three chemical genetic screens wild-type yeast cells established nab promoted endosomal transport events dependent e3 ubiquitin ligase rsp5/nedd4 steps perturbed alpha-syn thus nab identifies druggable node biology alpha-syn can correct multiple aspects underlying pathology including dysfunctional endosomal endoplasmic reticulum-to-golgi vesicle trafficking
