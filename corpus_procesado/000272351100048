gabaergic hub neurons orchestrate synchrony developing hippocampal networks
brain function operates coordinated activation neuronal assemblies graph theory predicts scale-free topologies include hubs superconnected nodes effective design orchestrate synchronization whether hubs present neuronal assemblies coordinate network activity remains unknown using network dynamics imaging online reconstruction functional connectivity targeted whole-cell recordings rats mice found developing hippocampal networks follow scale-free topology demonstrated existence functional hubs perturbation single hub influenced entire network dynamics morphophysiological analysis revealed hub cells subpopulation gamma-aminobutyric acid-releasing gabaergic interneurons possessing widespread axonal arborizations findings establish central role gabaergic interneurons shaping developing networks help provide conceptual framework studying neuronal synchrony
