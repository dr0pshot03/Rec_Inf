measuring intense rotation dissipation turbulent flows
turbulent flows highly intermittent example exhibit intense bursts vorticity strain kolmogorov theory describes behaviour form energy cascades large small spatial temporal scales energy dissipated heat causes high intermittency turbulence show non-gaussian statistics- well understood intermittency can important example enhancing mixing chemicals producing sharp drops local pressure can induce cavitation damaging mechanical components biological organisms causing intense vortices atmospheric flows present observations three components velocity nine velocity gradients within small volume allow us determine simultaneously dissipation measure strain enstrophy measure rotational energy turbulent flow combining statistics measurements evolution individual bursts find typical sequence intense events begins rapid strain growth followed rising vorticity final sudden decline stretching suggest two mechanisms can produce characteristics depending whether due advection coherent structures observed volume caused locally
