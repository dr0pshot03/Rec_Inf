dynamically important magnetic fields near accreting supermassive black holes
accreting supermassive black holes centres active galaxies often produce jets-collimated bipolar outflows relativistic particles magnetic fields probably play critical role jet formation accretion disk physics dynamically important magnetic field recently found near galactic centre black hole common field continues near black hole event horizon disk structures will affected invalidating assumptions made standard models report jet magnetic field accretion disk luminosity tightly correlated seven orders magnitude sample radio-loud active galaxies conclude jet-launching regions radio-loud galaxies threaded dynamically important fields will affect disk properties fields obstruct gas infall compress accretion disk vertically slow disk rotation carrying away angular momentum outflow determine directionality jets
