flexible retinotopy: motion-dependent position coding visual cortex 
although visual cortex organized retinotopically clear whether cortical representation position necessarily reflects perceived position using functional magnetic resonance imaging fmri show retinotopic representation stationary object cortex systematically shifted visual motion present scene whereas object appear shifted direction visual motion representation object visual cortex always shifted opposite direction results show representation position primary visual cortex revealed fmri can dissociated perceived location
