doc2b high-affinity ca2+ sensor spontaneous neurotransmitter release 
synaptic vesicle fusion brain synapses occurs phases either tightly coupled action potentials synchronous immediately following action potentials asynchronous stochastic events absence action potentials spontaneous synaptotagmin- vesicle-associated ca2+ sensors synchronous release found double c2 domain doc2 proteins act ca2+ sensors trigger spontaneous release although doc2 proteins cytosolic function analogously synaptotagmin- higher ca2+ sensitivity doc2 proteins bound n-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment receptor snare complexes competition synaptotagmin- thus different classes multiple c2 domain-containing molecules trigger synchronous versus spontaneous fusion suggests general mechanism synaptic vesicle fusion triggered combined actions snares multiple c2 domain-containing proteins
