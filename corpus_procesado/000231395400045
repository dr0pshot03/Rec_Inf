multiple causes high extinction risk large mammal species 
many large animal species high risk extinction usually thought result simply way species traits associated vulnerability low reproductive rates scale body size broad-scale analysis extinction risk mammals find two additional patterns size selectivity extinction risk first impacts intrinsic environmental factors increase sharply threshold body mass around kilograms second whereas extinction risk smaller species driven environmental factors larger species driven combination environmental factors intrinsic traits thus disadvantages large size greater generally recognized future loss large mammal biodiversity far rapid expected
