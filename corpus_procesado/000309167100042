cross-neutralization influenza viruses mediated single antibody loop 
immune recognition protein antigens relies combined interaction multiple antibody loops provide fairly large footprint constrain size shape protein surfaces can targeted single protein loops can mediate extremely high-affinity binding unclear whether mechanism available antibodies report isolation characterization antibody called c05 neutralizes strains multiple subtypes influenza virus including h1 h2 h3 x-ray electron microscopy structures show c05 recognizes conserved elements receptor-binding site haemagglutinin surface glycoprotein recognition haemagglutinin receptor-binding site dominated single heavy-chain complementarity-determining region loop minor contacts heavy-chain complementarity-determining region sufficient achieve nanomolar binding minimal footprint thus binding predominantly single loop can allow antibodies target small conserved functional sites otherwise hypervariable antigens
