carbon-negative biofuels low-input high-diversity grassland biomass
biofuels derived low-input high-diversity lihd mixtures native grassland perennials can provide usable energy greater greenhouse gas reductions less agrichemical pollution per hectare can corn grain ethanol soybean biodiesel high-diversity grasslands increasingly higher bioenergy yields % greater monoculture yields decade lihd biofuels carbon negative net ecosystem carbon dioxide sequestration megagram hectare- year- carbon dioxide soil roots exceeds fossil carbon dioxide release biofuel production megagram hectare- year- moreover lihd biofuels can produced agriculturally degraded lands thus need neither displace food production cause loss biodiversity via habitat destruction
