spatial temporal offsets proxy records sediment drift 
chronologies late quaternary marine sediment records usually based radiocarbon ages planktonic foraminifera signals carried sedimentary components measured parallel can provide complementary paleoclimate information key premise microfossils indicators within given sediment horizon equal age show haptophyte-derived alkenones isolated bermuda rise drift sediments years older coexisting planktonic foraminifera temporal offset apparently due lateral transport alkenones fine-grained particles nova scotian margin markedly influences molecular estimates sea surface temperatures broadly observation raises questions temporal geographic delity paleoenvironmental records encoded readily transported components sediments
