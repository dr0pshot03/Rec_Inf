spin-dependent quantum interference within single magnetic nanostructure 
quantum interference coherent quantum phenomenon takes place confined geometries using spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy found quantum interference electrons causes spatial modulation spin polarization within single magnetic nanostructure observed changes sign magnitude spin polarization subnanometer scale comparison experimental results ab initio calculations shows given energy modulation spin polarization can ascribed difference spatially modulated local density states majority spin nonmodulated minority spin contribution
