stochastic single-molecule event triggers phenotype switching bacterial cell 
monitoring fluorescently labeled lactose permease single-molecule sensitivity investigated molecular mechanism escherichia coli cell lac operon switches one phenotype another intermediate inducer concentrations population genetically identical cells exhibits two phenotypes: induced cells highly fluorescent membranes uninduced cells small number membrane-bound permeases found basal-level expression results partial dissociation tetrameric lactose repressor one operators looped dna contrast infrequent events complete dissociation repressor dna result large bursts permease expression trigger induction lac operon hence stochastic single-molecule event determines cells phenotype
