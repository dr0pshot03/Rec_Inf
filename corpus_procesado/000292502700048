running red queen: host-parasite coevolution selects biparental sex 
organisms reproduce outcrossing even though comes substantial costs red queen hypothesis proposes selection coevolving pathogens facilitates persistence outcrossing despite costs used experimental coevolution test red queen hypothesis found coevolution bacterial pathogen serratia marcescens resulted significantly outcrossing mixed mating experimental populations nematode caenorhabditis elegans furthermore found coevolution pathogen rapidly drove obligately selfing populations extinction whereas outcrossing populations persisted reciprocal coevolution thus consistent red queen hypothesis coevolving pathogens can select biparental sex
