females use multiple mating genetically loaded sperm competition target compatible genes
individuals socially monogamous species may participate copulations outside pair bond resulting extra-pair offspring although males benefit extra-pair behavior produce offspring adaptive function infidelity females remains elusive show female participation extra-pair copulations combined genetically loaded process sperm competition enables female finches target genes optimally compatible ensure fertility optimize offspring viability female behavior along postcopulatory processes demonstrated may provide adaptive function female infidelity socially monogamous animals
