role nuclear inositol -trisphosphate kinase transcriptional control 
phospholipase c two inositol polyphosphate ip kinases constitute signaling pathway regulates nuclear messenger rna export production inositol hexakisphosphate ip6 inositol -trisphosphate kinase pathway saccharomyces cerevisiae designated ipk2 found identical arg82 regulator transcriptional complex argr-mcm1 synthesis inositol -tetrakisphosphate ip6 required gene regulation argr-mcm1 thus phospholipase c pathway produces multiple ip messengers modulate distinct nuclear processes results reveal direct mechanism activation ip signaling may control gene expression
