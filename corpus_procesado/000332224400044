crystal structure plant dual-affinity nitrate transporter nrt1 
nitrate primary nutrient plant growth levels soil can fluctuate several orders magnitude previous studies identified arabidopsis nrt1 dual-affinity nitrate transporter can take nitrate wide range concentrations mode action nrt1 controlled phosphorylation key residue thr however post-translational modification switches transporter two affinity states remains unclear report crystal structure unphosphorylated nrt1 reveals unexpected homodimer inward-facing conformation low-affinity state thr phosphorylation site embedded pocket immediately adjacent dimer interface linking phosphorylation status transporter oligomeric state using cell-based fluorescence resonance energy transfer assay show functional nrt1 dimerizes cell membrane phosphomimetic mutation thr converts protein monophasic high-affinity transporter structurally decoupling dimer together analyses substrate transport tunnel results establish phosphorylation-controlled dimerization switch allows nrt1 uptake nitrate two distinct affinity modes
