controlled formation sharp zigzag armchair edges graphitic nanoribbons
graphene nanoribbons can exhibit either quasi-metallic semiconducting behavior depending atomic structure edges thus important control morphology crystallinity edges practical purposes demonstrated efficient edge-reconstruction process atomic scale graphitic nanoribbons joule heating joule heating electron beam irradiation carbon atoms vaporized subsequently sharp edges step-edge arrays stabilized mostly either zigzag armchair-edge configurations model calculations show dominant annealing mechanisms involve point defect annealing edge reconstruction
