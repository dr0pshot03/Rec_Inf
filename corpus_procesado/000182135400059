requirement cd4 t cell help generating functional cd8 t cell memory
although primary cd8 responses acute infections independent cd4 help unknown whether similar situation applies secondary responses show depletion cd4 cells recall response minimal effect whereas depletion priming phase leads reduced responses memory cd8 cells reinfection memory cd8 cells generated cd4+/+ mice responded normally transferred cd4-/- hosts whereas memory cd8 cells generated cd4-/- mice mounted defective recall responses cd4-/- adoptive hosts results demonstrate previously undescribed role cd4 help development functional cd8 memory
