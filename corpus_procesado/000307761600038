protocadherins mediate dendritic self-avoidance mammalian nervous system 
dendritic arborizations many neurons patterned process called self-avoidance branches arising single neuron repel other1- minimizing gaps overlaps within arborization self-avoidance facilitates complete coverage neurons territory neurites1- remarkably neurons display self-avoidance interact freely neurons subtype implying discriminate self non-self demonstrate roles clustered protocadherins pcdhs dendritic self-avoidance self/non-self discrimination pcdh locus encodes related cadherin-like transmembrane proteins least exhibit isoform-specific homophilic adhesion heterologous cells expressed stochastically combinatorially single neurons7- deletion pcdh genes mouse gamma-subcluster pcdhg genes disrupts self-avoidance dendrites retinal starburst amacrine cells sacs cerebellar purkinje cells genetic analysis sacs showed pcdhg proteins act cell-autonomously development replacement pcdhg proteins single isoform restores self-avoidance moreover expression single isoform sacs decreases interactions among dendrites neighbouring sacs heteroneuronal interactions results suggest homophilic pcdhg interactions sibling neurites isoneuronal interactions generate repulsive signal leads self-avoidance model heteroneuronal interactions normally permitted dendrites seldom encounter matched set pcdhg proteins unless emanate soma many respects results mirror reported dscam1 syndrome cell adhesion molecule drosophila: complex gene encodes thousands recognition molecules exhibit stochastic expression isoform-specific interactions mediate self-avoidance self/non-self discrimination4-- thus although insect dscam vertebrate pcdh proteins share sequence homology seem underlie similar strategies endowing neurons distinct molecular identities patterning arborizations
