atom-resolved imaging ordered defect superstructures individual grain boundaries 
ability resolve spatially identify chemically atoms defects greatly advance understanding correlation structure property materials particularly important polycrystalline materials grain boundaries profound implications properties applications final material however atomic resolution still extremely difficult achieve partly grain boundaries effective sinks atomic defects impurities- may drive structural transformation grain boundaries consequently modify material properties regardless origin sinks interplay defects grain boundaries complicates efforts pinpoint exact sites chemistries entities present defective regions thereby limiting understanding specific defects mediate property changes show combination advanced electron microscopy spectroscopy first-principles calculations can provide three-dimensional images complex multicomponent grain boundaries atomic resolution chemical sensitivity high resolution techniques allows us demonstrate even magnesium oxide simple rock-salt structure grain boundaries can accommodate complex ordered defect superstructures induce significant electron trapping bandgap oxide results offer insights interactions defects grain boundaries ceramics demonstrate atomic-scale analysis complex multicomponent structures materials now becoming possible
