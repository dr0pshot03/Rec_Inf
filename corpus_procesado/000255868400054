genetic evidence fgfs instructive role limb proximal-distal patterning
half century ago apical ectodermal ridge aer distal tip tetrapod limb bud shown produce signals necessary development along proximal-distal p-d axis signals influence limb patterning still much debated fibroblast growth factor fgf gene family members key aer-derived signals fgf4 fgf8 fgf9 fgf17 expressed specifically mouse aer demonstrate mouse limbs lacking fgf4 fgf9 fgf17 normal skeletal pattern indicating fgf8 sufficient among aer-fgfs sustain normal limb formation inactivation fgf8 alone causes mild skeletal phenotype however also removed different combinations aer-fgf genes obtained unexpected skeletal phenotypes increasing severity reflecting contribution fgf can make total aer-fgf signal analysis compound mutant limb buds revealed addition sustaining cell survival aer-fgfs regulate p-d-patterning gene expression early limb bud development providing genetic evidence aer-fgfs function specify distal domain challenging long-standing hypothesis aer-fgf signalling permissive rather instructive limb patterning discuss two-signal model p-d patterning can integrated concept early specification explain genetic data presented
