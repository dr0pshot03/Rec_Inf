topological dirac insulator quantum spin hall phase 
electrons subject large external magnetic field conventional charge quantum hall effect dictates electronic excitation gap generated sample bulk metallic conduction permitted boundary recent theoretical models suggest certain bulk insulators large spin orbit interactions may also naturally support conducting topological boundary states quantum limit- opens possibility studying unusual quantum hall like phenomena zero external magnetic fields bulk bi1-xsbx single crystals predicted prime candidates one unusual hall phase matter known topological insulator- hallmark topological insulator existence metallic surface states higher dimensional analogues edge states characterize quantum spin hall insulator- addition interesting boundary states bulk bi1-xsbx predicted exhibit three dimensional dirac particles- another topic heightened current interest following new findings two-dimensional graphene- charge quantum hall fractionalization observed pure bismuth however despite numerous transport magnetic measurements bi1-xsbx family since 1960s direct evidence either topological hall states bulk dirac particles found using incident photon energy modulated angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy ipem arpes report direct observation massive dirac particles bulk bi09sb0 locate kramers points samples boundary provide comprehensive mapping dirac insulators gapless surface electron bands findings taken together suggest observed surface state boundary bulk insulator realization topological metal- also suggest material potential application developing next generation quantum computing devices may incorporate light like bulk carriers spin textured surface currents
