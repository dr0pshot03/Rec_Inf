c57bl/6n mutation cytoplasmic fmrp interacting protein regulates cocaine response
inbred mouse c57bl/6j reference strain genome sequence behavioral physiological phenotypes however international knockout mouse consortium uses embryonic stem cell line derived related c57bl/6n substrain found c57bl/6n lower acute sensitized response cocaine methamphetamine mapped single causative locus identified nonsynonymous mutation serine phenylalanine s968f cytoplasmic fmrp interacting protein cyfip2 causative variant s968f mutation destabilizes cyfip2 deletion c57bl/6n mutant allele leads acute sensitized cocaine-response phenotypes propose cyfip2 key regulator cocaine response mammals present framework use mouse substrains identify previously unknown genes alleles regulating behavior
