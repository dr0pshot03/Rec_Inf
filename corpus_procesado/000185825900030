elusive bose metal 
conventional theory metals crisis past years unexpected sprouting metallic states low-dimensional systems directly contradicting conventional wisdom example bosons thought exist one two ground states: condensed superconductor localized insulator however several experiments thin metal-alloy films observed metallic phase disrupts direct transition superconductor insulator analyze experiments insulator-superconductor transition argue intervening metallic phase bosonic relevant theoretical proposals bose metal discussed particularly recent idea metallic phase glassy implications putative vortex-glass state copper oxide superconductors examined
