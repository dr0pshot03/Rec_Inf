crystal structure mammalian fatty acid synthase
mammalian fatty acid synthase large multienzyme catalyzes steps fatty acid synthesis determined crystal structure angstrom resolution covering five catalytic domains whereas flexibly tethered terminal acyl carrier protein thioesterase domains remain unresolved structure reveals complex architecture alternating linkers enzymatic domains substrate shuttling facilitated flexible tethering acyl carrier protein domain limited contact condensing modifying portions multienzyme mainly connected linkers rather direct interaction structure identifies two additional nonenzymatic domains: pseudo ketoreductase ii peripheral pseudo methyltransferase probably remnant ancestral methyltransferase domain maintained related polyketide synthases structural comparison mammalian fatty acid synthase modular polyketide synthases shows segmental construction allows variation domain composition achieve diverse product synthesis
