neural substrates vocalization feedback monitoring primate auditory cortex 
vocal communication involves speaking hearing often taking place concurrently vocal production including human speech animal vocalization poses number unique challenges auditory system important auditory system monitor external sounds continuously acoustic environment speaking despite potential sensory masking self-generated sounds also essential auditory system monitor feedback ones voice self-monitoring may play part distinguishing self-generated externally generated auditory inputs detecting errors vocal production previous work humans- animals- demonstrated auditory cortex largely suppressed speaking vocalizing despite importance self-monitoring underlying neural mechanisms mammalian brain particular role vocalization-induced suppression remain virtually unknown show neurons auditory cortex marmoset monkeys callithrix jacchus sensitive auditory feedback vocal production changes feedback alter coding properties neurons furthermore found previously described cortical suppression vocalization actually increased sensitivity neurons vocal feedback heightened sensitivity vocal feedback suggests neurons may important role auditory self-monitoring
