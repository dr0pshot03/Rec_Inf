prestin motor protein cochlear outer hair cells
outer inner hair cells mammalian cochlea perform different functions response changes membrane potential cylindrical outer hair cell rapidly alters length stiffness mechanical changes driven putative molecular motors assumed produce amplification vibrations cochlea transduced inner hair cells identified abundant complementary dna gene designated prestin specifically expressed outer hair cells regions encoded protein show moderate sequence similarity pendrin related sulphate/anion transport proteins voltage-induced shape changes can elicited cultured human kidney cells express prestin mechanical response outer hair cells voltage change accompanied gating current manifested nonlinear capacitance also demonstrate nonlinear capacitance transfected kidney cells conclude prestin motor protein cochlear outer hair cell
