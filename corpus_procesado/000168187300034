bose-einstein condensate metastable atoms 
report realization bose-einstein condensate metastable atoms helium lowest triplet state excitation energy atom respect ground state electron volts inelastic processes destroy sample suppressed strongly enough spin-polarized sample allow condensation detection scheme takes advantage metastability achieve detection individual atoms well decay products inelastic processes detection opens way toward new studies mesoscopic quantum statistical physics well atomic quantum optics
