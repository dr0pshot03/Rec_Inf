quantitative phylogenetic assessment microbial communities diverse environments
taxonomic composition environmental communities important indicator ecology function used set protein-coding marker genes extracted large-scale environmental shotgun sequencing data provide direct quantitative accurate picture community composition provided traditional ribosomal rna-based approaches depending polymerase chain reaction mapping marker genes four diverse environmental data sets onto reference species phylogeny shows certain communities evolve faster others method also enables determination preferred habitats entire microbial clades provides evidence habitat preferences often remarkably stable time
