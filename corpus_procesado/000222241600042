dynamics slow-moving landslides permanent scatterer analysis 
high-resolution interferometric synthetic aperture radar insar permanent scatterer data allow us resolve rates variations rates slow-moving landslides satellite-to-ground distances range changes landslides increase rates millimeters per year indicating average downslope sliding velocities millimeters per year time-series analysis shows displacement occurs mainly high-precipitation season el nino event rates range change increased much millimeters per year observed nonlinear relationship creep precipitation rates suggests increased pore fluid pressures within shallow subsurface may initiate accelerate features changes slope hill resulting increases pore pressure lithostatic stress gradients may lead landslides
