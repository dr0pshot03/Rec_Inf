optical clock based single trapped hg+ ion
microwave atomic clocks de facto standards precision time frequency metrology past years finding widespread use basic scientific studies communications navigation however higher operating frequency atomic clock based optical transition can much stable demonstrate all-optical atomic clock referenced -petahertz transition single trapped hg+ ion clock-work based mode-locked femtosecond laser provides output pulses gigahertz rate phase-coherently locked optical frequency comparison laser-cooled calcium optical standard upper limit fractional frequency instability x - measured second averaging-a value substantially better worlds best microwave atomic clocks
