magnetic superstructure two-dimensional quantum antiferromagnet srcu2bo3
report observation magnetic superstructure magnetization plateau state srcu2bo3 frustrated quasi two-dimensional quantum spin system cu b nuclear magnetic resonance nmr spectra millikelvin indicate apparently discontinuous phase transition uniform magnetization modulated superstructure near tesla magnetization plateau / full saturation observed comparison cu nmr spectrum theoretical analysis heisenberg spin model demonstrates crystallization itinerant triplets plateau phase within large rhomboid unit cell spins per layer showing oscillations spin polarization thus now possession interesting model system study localization transition strongly interacting quantum particles
