stochasticity metabolism growth single-cell level
elucidating role molecular stochasticity cellular growth central understanding phenotypic heterogeneity stability cellular proliferation inherent stochasticity metabolic reaction events negligible effect averaging many reaction events contributing growth indeed metabolism growth often considered constant fixed conditions stochastic fluctuations expression level- metabolic enzymes produce variations reactions catalyse however whether molecular fluctuations can affect growth unclear given various stabilizing regulatory mechanisms- slow adjustment key cellular components ribosomes secretion buffering excess metabolites use time-lapse microscopy measure fluctuations instantaneous growth rate single cells escherichia coli quantify time-resolved cross-correlations expression lac genes enzymes central metabolism show expression fluctuations catabolically active enzymes can propagate cause growth fluctuations transmission depending limitation enzyme growth conversely growth fluctuations propagate back perturb expression accordingly enzymes found transmit noise unrelated genes via growth homeostasis promoted noise-cancelling mechanism exploits fluctuations dilution proteins cell-volume expansion results indicate molecular noise propagated regulatory proteins also metabolic reactions also suggest cellular metabolism inherently stochastic generic source phenotypic heterogeneity
