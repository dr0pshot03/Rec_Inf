primate amygdala represents positive negative value visual stimuli learning
visual stimuli can acquire positive negative value association rewards punishments process called reinforcement learning although now know great deal brain analyses visual information know little visual representations become linked values study process turned amygdala brain structure implicated reinforcement learning- recorded activity individual amygdala neurons monkeys abstract images acquired either positive negative value conditioning monkeys learned initial associations reversed image value assignments examined neural responses relation reversals order estimate relative contribution neural activity sensory properties images conditioned values show changes values images modulate neural activity modulation occurs rapidly enough account correlates monkeys learning furthermore distinct populations neurons encode positive negative values visual stimuli behavioural physiological responses visual stimuli may therefore based part plastic representation value provided amygdala
