regulation neuronal survival factor mef2d chaperone-mediated autophagy
chaperone mediated autophagy controls degradation selective cytosolic proteins may protect neurons degeneration neuronal cell line found chaperone mediated autophagy regulated activity myocyte enhancer factor 2d mef2d transcription factor required neuronal survival mef2d observed continuously shuttle cytoplasm interact chaperone hsc70 undergo degradation inhibition chaperone mediated autophagy caused accumulation inactive mef2d cytoplasm mef2d levels increased brains alpha-synuclein transgenic mice patients parkinsons disease wild-type alpha-synuclein parkinsons disease associated mutant disrupted mef2d-hsc70 binding led neuronal death thus chaperone mediated autophagy modulates neuronal survival machinery dysregulation pathway associated parkinsons disease
