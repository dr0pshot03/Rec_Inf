neural circuit spatial summation visual cortex 
response cortical neurons sensory stimulus modulated context visual cortex example stimulation pyramidal cells receptive-field surround can attenuate cells response stimulus centre receptive field phenomenon called surround suppression whether cortical circuits contribute surround suppression whether phenomenon entirely relayed earlier stages visual processing debated show contrast pyramidal cells response somatostatin-expressing inhibitory neurons soms superficial layers mouse visual cortex increases stimulation receptive-field surround difference results preferential excitation soms horizontal cortical axons perturbing activity soms show neurons contribute pyramidal cells surround suppression results establish cortical circuit surround suppression attribute particular function genetically defined type inhibitory neuron
