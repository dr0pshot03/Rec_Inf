high-resolution map three-dimensional chromatin interactome human cells 
large number cis-regulatory sequences annotated human genome defining target genes remains challenge one strategy identify long-range looping interactions elements use chromosome conformation capture 3c-based techniques however previous studies lack either resolution coverage permit whole-genome unbiased view chromatin interactions report comprehensive chromatin interaction map generated human fibroblasts using genome-wide 3c analysis method hi-c determined one million long-range chromatin interactions -kb resolution uncovered general principles chromatin organization different types genomic features also characterized dynamics promoter-enhancer contacts tnf-alpha signalling cells unexpectedly found tnf-alpha-responsive enhancers already contact target promoters signalling pre-existing chromatin looping also exists cell types different extracellular signalling strong predictor gene induction observations suggest three-dimensional chromatin landscape established particular cell type relatively stable influence selection activation target genes ubiquitous transcription activator cell-specific manner
