sequestration two-component response regulator riboswitch-regulated noncoding rna 
riboswitches ligand-binding elements contained within untranslated regions bacterial transcripts generally regulate expression downstream open reading frames show listeria monocytogenes riboswitch binds vitamin b controls expression noncoding regulatory rna rli55 rli55 turn controls expression eut genes whose products enable ethanolamine utilization require b12 cofactor defects ethanolamine utilization regulation rli55 significantly attenuate listeria virulence mice rli55 functions sequestering two-component response regulator eutv means eutv-binding site contained within rna thus rli55 riboswitch-regulated member small group regulatory rnas function sequestering protein reveals distinctive mechanism signal integration bacterial gene regulation
