assembly-line synthesis organic molecules tailored shapes 
molecular assembly lines organic molecules undergo iterative processes chain elongation functional group manipulation found many natural systems including polyketide biosynthesis report creation assembly line using iterative reagent-controlled homologation boronic ester process relies reactivity alpha-lithioethyl tri-isopropylbenzoate inserts carbon-boron bonds exceptionally high fidelity stereocontrol; chain-extension step generates new boronic ester immediately ready homologation used method generate organic molecules contain ten contiguous stereochemically defined methyl groups several stereoisomers synthesized shown adopt different shapes-helical linear-depending stereochemistry methyl groups work facilitate rational design molecules predictable shapes impact areas molecular sciences bespoke molecules required
