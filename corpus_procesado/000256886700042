formation conditions chondrules chondrites
chondrules roughly millimeter sized silicate rich spherules dominate primitive meteorites chondrites formed molten droplets judging abundances chondrites products one energetic processes operated early inner solar system conditions mechanism chondrule formation remain poorly understood show abundance volatile element sodium remained relatively constant chondrule formation prevention evaporation sodium requires chondrules formed regions much higher solid densities predicted known nebular concentration mechanisms regions probably self gravitating model explains many chemical characteristics chondrules also implies chondrule planetesimal formation linked
