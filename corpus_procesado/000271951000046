paternal dominance trans-eqtl influences gene expression patterns maize hybrids
heterosis refers superior performance hybrid progeny relative inbred parents mechanisms responsible unknown hybrids maize inbred lines b73 mo17 exhibit heterosis regardless cross direction reciprocal hybrids differ phenotypically % genes differentially expressed identified similar expression quantitative trait loci eqtl allowed us identify markers linked variation expression found three-quarters eqtl act trans % % differentially regulate transcript accumulation manner consistent gene expression hybrid regulated exclusively paternally transmitted allele result suggests widespread imprinting contributes regulation gene expression maize hybrids
