direct sampling electric-field vacuum fluctuations
ground state quantum systems characterized zero-point motion motion form vacuum fluctuations generally considered elusive phenomenon manifests indirectly report direct detection vacuum fluctuations electromagnetic radiation free space ground-state electric-field variance inversely proportional four-dimensional space-time volume sampled electro-optically tightly focused laser pulses lasting femtoseconds subcycle temporal readout nonlinear coupling far resonance provide signals purely virtual photons without amplification findings enable extreme time-domain approach quantum physics nondestructive access quantum state light operating multiterahertz frequencies techniques might also allow time-resolved studies intrinsic fluctuations elementary excitations condensed matter
