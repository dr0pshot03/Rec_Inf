speciation along environmental gradients 
traditional discussions speciation based geographical patterns species ranges allopatric speciation long-term geographical isolation generates reproductively isolated spatially segregated descendant species absence geographical barriers diversification hindered gene flow yet growing body phylogenetic experimental data suggests closely related species often occur sympatry adjacent ranges regions environmental changes gradual prevent gene flow- theory identified variety evolutionary processes can result speciation sympatric conditions- recent advances concentrating phenomenon evolutionary branching- establish link geographical patterns ecological processes speciation studying evolutionary branching spatially structured populations show along environmental gradient evolutionary branching can occur much easily non-spatial models facilitation pronounced gradients intermediate slope moreover spatial evolutionary branching readily generates patterns spatial segregation abutment emerging species results highlight importance local processes adaptive divergence geographical patterns speciation caution pitfalls inferring past speciation processes present biogeographical patterns
