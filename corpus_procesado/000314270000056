uncovering protein translocon chloroplast inner envelope membrane 
chloroplasts require protein translocons outer inner envelope membranes termed toc tic respectively import thousands cytoplasmically synthesized preproteins however molecular identity tic translocon remains controversial tic20 forms megadalton complex inner membrane directly interacts translocating preproteins purified megadalton complex arabidopsis comprising tic20 three essential components one encoded enigmatic open reading frame ycf1 chloroplast genome four components together well-known toc components found stoichiometrically associated different translocating preproteins reconstituted planar lipid bilayers purified complex formed preprotein-sensitive channel thus complex constitutes general tic translocon
