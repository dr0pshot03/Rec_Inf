sequence-directed dna translocation purified ftsk
dna translocases molecular motors move rapidly along dna using adenosine triphosphate source energy directly observed movement purified ftsk escherichia coli translocase single dna molecules protein moves kilobases per second forces piconewtons locally reverses direction without dissociation three natural substrates independent initial binding position ftsk efficiently translocates long distances terminal region e coli chromosome vivo results imply ftsk bidirectional motor changes direction response short asymmetric directing dna sequences
