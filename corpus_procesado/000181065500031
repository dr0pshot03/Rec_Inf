gigahertz electron spin manipulation using voltage-controlled g-tensor modulation 
present scheme enables gigahertz-bandwidth three-dimensional control electron spins semiconductor heterostructure use single voltage signal microwave modulation lande g tensor produces frequency-modulated electron spin precession driving larmor frequency results g-tensor modulation resonance functionally equivalent electron spin resonance without use time-dependent magnetic fields results provide proof concept quantum spin information can locally manipulated use high-speed electrical circuits
