two-dimensional electronic excitations self-assembled conjugated polymer nanocrystals 
several spectroscopic methods applied study characteristic properties electronic excitations thin films regioregular regiorandom polythiophene polymers regioregular polymers form two-dimensional lamellar structures increased interchain coupling strongly influences traditional one-dimensional electronic properties polymer chains photogenerated charge excitations polarons show two-dimensional delocalization results relatively small polaronic energy multiple absorption bands gap lowest energy band becomes dominant associated infrared active vibrations reverse absorption bands caused electron-vibration interferences relatively weak absorption bands delocalized polaron visible near-infrared spectral ranges may help achieve laser action nanocrystalline polymer devices using current injection
