ecological adaptation incipient speciation revealed precise gene replacement
understand role adaptation speciation one must characterize ecologically relevant phenotypic effects naturally occurring alleles loci potentially causing reproductive isolation desaturase2 gene drosophila melanogaster locus two geographically differentiated ds2 alleles underlie pheromonal difference zimbabwe cosmopolitan races used site-directed gene replacement technique introduce allele ds2 zimbabwe population cosmopolitan flies show cosmopolitan allele confers resistance cold well susceptibility starvation entire genetic background otherwise identical conclude ecological adaptation likely accompanies sexual isolation two behavioral races d melanogaster
