short fe-fe distance peroxodiferric ferritin: control fe substrate versus cofactor decay 
reaction oxygen protein diiron sites important bioorganic syntheses biomineralization unusually short fe-fe distance angstroms found diiron mu- peroxodiferric intermediate forms early steps ferritin biomineralization distance suggests presence unique triply bridged structure fe-fe distances mu- peroxodiferric complexes characterized previously much longer angstroms angstrom fe-fe distance requires small fe-o-o angle similar degrees degrees geometry favor decay peroxodiferric complex release h2o2 mu-oxo mu-hydroxo diferric biomineral precursors rather oxidation organic substrate geometrical differences may thus explain diiron sites can function either substrate ferritin biomineralization cofactor o activation
