activity mtor-dependent suppression kv1 channel mrna translation dendrites
mammalian target rapamycin mtor implicated synaptic plasticity local translation dendrites found mtor inhibitor rapamycin increased kv1 voltage-gated potassium channel protein hippocampal neurons promoted kv1 surface expression dendrites without altering axonal expression moreover endogenous kv1 mrna detected dendrites using kv1 fused photoconvertible fluorescence protein kaede reporter local synthesis observed kv1 synthesis dendrites upon inhibition mtor n-methyl-d-aspartate nmda glutamate receptor thus synaptic excitation may cause local suppression dendritic kv1 channels reducing local synthesis
