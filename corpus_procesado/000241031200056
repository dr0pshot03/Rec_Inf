activity mtor-dependent suppression kv11 channel mrna translation dendrites 
mammalian target rapamycin mtor implicated synaptic plasticity local translation dendrites found mtor inhibitor rapamycin increased kv11 voltage-gated potassium channel protein hippocampal neurons promoted kv11 surface expression dendrites without altering axonal expression moreover endogenous kv11 mrna detected dendrites using kv11 fused photoconvertible fluorescence protein kaede reporter local synthesis observed kv11 synthesis dendrites upon inhibition mtor n-methyl-d-aspartate nmda glutamate receptor thus synaptic excitation may cause local suppression dendritic kv1 channels reducing local synthesis
