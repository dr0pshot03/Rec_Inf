local sleep awake rats
awake state neurons cerebral cortex fire irregularly electroencephalogram eeg recordings display low-amplitude high-frequency fluctuations sleep neurons oscillate periods fire awake brain periods stop firing altogether eeg displays high-amplitude slowwaves however happens neuronal firing long period awake known show freely behaving rats long period awake state cortical neurons can go briefly offline sleep accompanied slow waves local eeg neurons often go offline one cortical area another periods local sleep incidence increases duration awake state rats active display awake eeg however progressively impaired sugar pellet reaching task thus although eeg behaviour indicate wakefulness local populations neurons cortex may falling asleep negative consequences performance
