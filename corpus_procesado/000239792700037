genomic code nucleosome positioning 
eukaryotic genomes packaged nucleosome particles occlude dna interacting dna binding proteins nucleosomes higher affinity particular dna sequences reflecting ability sequence bend sharply required nucleosome structure however known whether sequence preferences significant influence nucleosome position vivo thus regulate access proteins dna isolated nucleosome-bound sequences high resolution yeast used sequences new computational approach construct validate experimentally nucleosome dna interaction model predict genome-wide organization nucleosomes results demonstrate genomes encode intrinsic nucleosome organization intrinsic organization can explain similar % vivo nucleosome positions nucleosome positioning code may facilitate specific chromosome functions including transcription factor binding transcription initiation even remodelling nucleosomes
