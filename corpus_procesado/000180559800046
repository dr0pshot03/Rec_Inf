evolutionary advantage haploidy large yeast populations 
although seed plants multicellular animals predominantly diploid prominence diploidy varies greatly among eukaryote life cycles general evolutionary advantage diploidy demonstrated doubling copy number gene diploidy may increase rate adaptive mutations produced however models suggest necessarily accelerate adaptation diploid populations tested model predictions regarding rates adaptation using asexual yeast populations adaptive mutations average partially recessive predicted diploidy slowed adaptation large populations small populations
