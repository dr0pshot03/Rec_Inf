gating rapid shade-avoidance response circadian clock plants
phytochromes family plant photoreceptor proteins control several adaptive developmental strategies example phytochromes perceive far red light wavelengths nm reflected scattered leaves nearby vegetation provides early warning potential shading triggers series shade avoidance responses rapid increase elongation plant attempts overgrow neighbours less immediate responses include accelerated flowering early production seeds however little known molecular events connect light perception increased growth shade avoidance show circadian clock gates rapid shade avoidance response apparent around dusk accompanied altered expression several genes one rapidly responsive genes encodes basic helix loop helix protein pil1 previously shown interact clock protein toc1 ref furthermore pil1 toc1 required accelerated growth associated shade avoidance response
