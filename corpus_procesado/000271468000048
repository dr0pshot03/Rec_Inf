mafb/c-maf deficiency enables self-renewal differentiated functional macrophages
metazoan organisms terminal differentiation generally tightly linked cell cycle exit whereas undifferentiated state pluripotent stem cells associated unlimited self-renewal report combined deficiency transcription factors mafb c-maf enables extended expansion mature monocytes macrophages culture without loss differentiated phenotype function upon transplantation expanded cells nontumorigenic contribute functional macrophage populations vivo small hairpin rna inactivation shows continuous proliferation mafb/c-maf deficient macrophages requires concomitant up-regulation two pluripotent stem cell-inducing factors klf4 c-myc results indicate mafb/c-mafb deficiency renders self-renewal compatible terminal differentiation thus appears possible amplify functional differentiated cells without malignant transformation stem cell intermediates
