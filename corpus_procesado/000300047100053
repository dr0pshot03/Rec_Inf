structural basis sequence-specific recognition dna tal effectors 
tal transcription activator-like effectors secreted phytopathogenic bacteria recognize host dna sequences central domain tandem repeats repeat comprises conserved amino acids targets specific base pair using two hypervariable residues [known repeat variable diresidues rvds] positions report crystal structures -repeat tal effector dna-free dna-bound states tal repeat comprises two helices connected short rvd-containing loop repeats form right-handed superhelical structure tracks along sense strand dna duplex rvds contacting major groove 12th residue stabilizes rvd loop whereas 13th residue makes base-specific contact understanding dna recognition tal effectors may facilitate rational design dna-binding proteins biotechnological applications
