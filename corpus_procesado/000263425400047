bidirectional promoters generate pervasive transcription yeast 
genome wide pervasive transcription reported many eukaryotic organisms- revealing highly interleaved transcriptome organization involves hundreds previously unknown non codingrnas recently identified transcripts either exist stably cells stable unannotated transcripts suts rapidly degraded rna surveillance pathway cryptic unstable transcripts cuts one characteristic pervasive transcription extensive overlap suts cuts previously annotated features prompts questions regarding transcripts generated whether exert function single gene studies shown transcription suts cuts can functional mechanisms involving generated rnas generation itself- far complete transcriptome architecture including suts cuts described organism knowledge position genome wide arrangement transcripts will instrumental understanding function provide comprehensive analysis transcripts context multiple conditions mutant exosome machinery different strain backgrounds saccharomyces cerevisiae show suts cuts display distinct patterns distribution specific locations newly identified transcripts initiate nucleosome free regions nfrs associated promoters transcripts mostly protein coding genes nfrs ends protein coding genes likewise half coding transcripts initiate nfrs associated promoters transcripts data change view genome transcribed indicating bidirectionality inherent feature promoters arrangement divergent overlapping transcripts may provide mechanism local spreading regulatory signals coupling transcriptional regulation neighbouring genes means transcriptional interference histone modification
