linking crystallographic model data quality 
macromolecular x-ray crystallography refinement r values measure agreement observed calculated data analogously r-merge values reporting agreement multiple measurements given reflection used assess data quality show despite widespread use r-merge values poorly suited determining high-resolution limit current standard protocols discard much useful data introduce statistic estimates correlation observed data set underlying measurable true signal; quantity cc* provides single statistically valid guide deciding data useful cc* also can used assess model data quality scale reveals data quality limiting model improvement
