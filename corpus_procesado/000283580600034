epigenetic modifications genome generally stable somatic cells multicellular organisms germ cells early embryos however epigenetic reprogramming occurs genome-wide scale includes demethylation dna remodeling histones modifications mechanisms genome-wide erasure dna methylation involve modifications -methylcytosine dna repair unraveled epigenetic reprogramming important roles imprinting natural well experimental acquisition totipotency pluripotency control transposons epigenetic inheritance across generations small rnas inheritance histone marks may also contribute epigenetic inheritance reprogramming reprogramming occurs flowering plants mammals similarities differences illuminate developmental reproductive strategies
