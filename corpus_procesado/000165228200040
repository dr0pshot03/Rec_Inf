african hot spot volcanism: small-scale convection upper mantle beneath cratons
numerical models demonstrate small-scale convection develops upper mantle beneath transition thick cratonic lithosphere thin oceanic lithosphere models explain location geochemical characteristics intraplate volcanos african south american plates also explain presence relatively high seismic shear wave velocities cold downwellings mantle transition zone beneath western margin african cratons eastern margin south american cratons small-scale edge-driven convection alternative plumes explaining intraplate african south american hot spot volcanism small-scale convection consistent mantle downwellings beneath african south american lithosphere
