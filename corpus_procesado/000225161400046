regulation p53 activity lysine methylation
p53 tumour suppressor regulates cellular response genotoxic stresses p53 short-lived protein activity regulated mostly stabilization via different post-translational modifications report novel mechanism p53 regulation lysine methylation set9 methyltransferase set9 specifically methylates p53 one residue within carboxyl-terminus regulatory region methylated p53 restricted nucleus modification positively affects stability set9 regulates expression p53 target genes manner dependent p53-methylation site crystal structure ternary complex set9 p53 peptide cofactor product s-adenosyl-l-homocysteine adohcy provides molecular basis recognition p53 lysine methyltransferase
