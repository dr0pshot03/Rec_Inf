decoding motor imagery posterior parietal cortex tetraplegic human 
nonhuman primate human studies suggested populations neurons posterior parietal cortex ppc may represent high-level aspects action planning can used control external devices part brain-machine interface however direct neuron-recording evidence human ppc involved action planning suitability signals neuroprosthetic control tested recorded neural population activity arrays microelectrodes implanted ppc tetraplegic subject motor imagery decoded neural populations including imagined goals trajectories types movement findings indicate ppc humans represents high-level cognitive aspects action ppc can rich source cognitive control signals neural prosthetics assist paralyzed patients
