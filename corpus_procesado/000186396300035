scanning probe evolution biology 
twenty years ago first scanning probe instrument scanning tunneling microscope opened new realms perception world atoms abstract entities now real objects clearly seen distinguishable individuals particular positions space whole family scanning probe instruments developed extending sense touching scale atoms molecules instruments especially useful imaging biomolecular structures can produce topographic images submolecular resolution aqueous environments instruments increased imaging rates lower probe-specimen force interactions probe configurations constrained planar surfaces developed goal imaging processes single-molecule level-not surfaces also within three-dimensional volumes-in real time
