il required control chronic viral infection 
cd4+ cd8+ t cell functions rapidly aborted chronic infection preventing viral clearance cd4+ t cell help required throughout chronic infection sustain cd8+ t cell responses however necessary factors provided cd4+ t cells currently unknown using mouse model chronic viral infection demonstrated interleukin il- essential component cd4+ t cell help absence il signaling despite elevated cd4+ t cell responses cd8+ t cell responses severely impaired cd8+ t cells directly require il avoid deletion maintain immunity resolve persistent infection thus il specifically sustains cd8+ t cell effector activity provides mechanism cd4+ t cell help chronic viral infection
