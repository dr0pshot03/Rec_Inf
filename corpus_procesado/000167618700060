expanded polyglutamine repeats proposed cause neuronal degeneration huntingtons disease hd related disorders abnormal interactions proteins containing short polyglutamine tracts transcriptional coactivator creb binding protein cbp found cbp depleted normal nuclear location present polyglutamine aggregates hd cell culture models hd transgenic: mice human hd postmortem brain expanded polyglutamine repeats specifically interfere cbp-activated gene transcription overexpression cbp rescued polyglutamine-induced neuronal toxicity thus polyglutamine-mediated interference cbp-regulated gene transcription may constitute genetic gain function underlying pathogenesis polyglutamine disorders
