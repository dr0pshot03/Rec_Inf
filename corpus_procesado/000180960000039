crystal structure naphthalene dioxygenase: side-on binding dioxygen iron 
binding oxygen iron exploited several biological chemical processes although computational spectroscopic results suggested side-on binding end-on binding oxygen iron observed crystal structures determined structures naphthalene dioxygenase show molecular oxygen species bound mononuclear iron side-on fashion complex substrate dioxygen dioxygen molecule lined attack double bond aromatic substrate structures reported provide basis reaction mechanism high stereospecificity reaction catalyzed naphthalene dioxygenase
