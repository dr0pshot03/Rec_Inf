mechanistic insights recycling machine snare complex 
evolutionarily conserved snare soluble n-ethylmaleimide sensitive factor attachment protein receptors proteins form complex drives membrane fusion eukaryotes atpase nsf n-ethylmaleimide sensitive factor together snaps soluble nsf attachment protein disassembles snare complex protein components making individual snares available subsequent rounds fusion report structures atp adp-bound nsf nsf/snap/snare 20s supercomplex determined single-particle electron cryomicroscopy nearatomic sub-nanometre resolution without imposing symmetry large potentially force-generating conformational differences exist atp adp-bound nsf 20s supercomplex exhibits broken symmetry transitioning fromsix-fold symmetry nsf atpase domains pseudo four-fold symmetry snare complex snaps interact snare complex opposite structural twist suggesting unwinding mechanism interfaces nsf snaps snares exhibit characteristic electrostatic patterns suggesting one nsf/snap species can act many different snare complexes
