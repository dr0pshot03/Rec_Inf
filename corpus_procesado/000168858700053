duplexes nucleotide rnas mediate rna interference cultured mammalian cells
rna interference rnai process sequence-specific post-transcriptional gene silencing animals plants initiated double-stranded rna dsrna homologous sequence silenced gene- mediators sequence-specific messenger rna degradation nucleotide small interfering rnas sirnas generated ribonuclease iii cleavage longer dsrnas- show nucleotide sirna duplexes specifically suppress expression endogenous heterologous genes different mammalian cell lines including human embryonic kidney hela cells therefore nucleotide sirna duplexes provide new tool studying gene function mammalian cells may eventually used gene-specific therapeutics
