duplexes -nucleotide rnas mediate rna interference cultured mammalian cells 
rna interference rnai process sequence-specific post-transcriptional gene silencing animals plants initiated double-stranded rna dsrna homologous sequence silenced gene1- mediators sequence-specific messenger rna degradation -nucleotide small interfering rnas sirnas generated ribonuclease iii cleavage longer dsrnas5- show -nucleotide sirna duplexes specifically suppress expression endogenous heterologous genes different mammalian cell lines including human embryonic kidney hela cells therefore -nucleotide sirna duplexes provide new tool studying gene function mammalian cells may eventually used gene-specific therapeutics
