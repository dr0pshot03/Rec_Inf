selection linked sites shapes heritable phenotypic variation c elegans 
mutation generates heritable variation genetic drift natural selection shape classical quantitative genetic models drift function effective population size acts uniformly across traits whereas mutation selection act trait-specifically identified thousands quantitative trait loci qtls influencing transcript abundance traits cross two caenorhabditis elegans strains although trait-specific mutation selection explained observed pattern qtl distribution pattern better explained trait-independent variation intensity selection linked sites results suggest traits c elegans exhibit different levels variation less attributes differences effective population sizes genomic regions harboring underlying loci
