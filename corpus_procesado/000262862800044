stretching single talin rod molecules activates vinculin binding
molecular mechanism mechanical stimulus translated chemical response biological systems still unclear show mechanical stretching single cytoplasmic proteins can activate binding molecules used magnetic tweezers total internal reflection fluorescence atomic force microscopy investigate effect force interaction talin protein links liganded membrane integrins cytoskeleton vinculin focal adhesion protein activated talin binding leading reorganization cytoskeleton application physiologically relevant forces caused stretching single talin rods exposed cryptic binding sites vinculin thus talin vinculin system molecular mechanotransduction can occur protein binding exposure buried binding sites talin-vinculin system protein stretching may general mechanism force transduction
