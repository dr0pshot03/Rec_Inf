human -> exonuclease xrn2 promotes transcription termination co-transcriptional cleavage sites 
eukaryotic protein-encoding genes possess polya signals define end messenger rna mediate downstream transcriptional termination rna polymerase ii pol ii1 termination occur anti-termination mechanism whereby elongation factors dissociate polya signal encountered producing termination-competent pol ii23 alternative torpedo model postulated polya site cleavage provides unprotected rna end degraded -> exonuclease activities torpedoes
