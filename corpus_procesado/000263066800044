two thresholds three male forms result facultative male trimorphism beetles
male animals many species deploy conditional reproductive strategies contain distinct alternative phenotypes facultatively expressed male tactics assumed due single developmental threshold mechanism switching expression two alternative phenotypes however discovered clade dung beetles commonly expresses two threshold mechanisms resulting three alternative phenotypes male trimorphism recognized found trimorphism beetle families involves different types male weapons evidence insects assumed dimorphic can express three facultative male forms suggests need adjust think animal mating systems evolution conditional strategies
