origins high hardening low ductility magnesium 
magnesium lightweight structural metal exhibits low ductility-connected unusual mechanistically unexplained dislocation plasticity phenomena-which makes difficult form use energy-saving lightweight structures employ long-time molecular dynamics simulations utilizing density-functional-theory-validated interatomic potential reveal fundamental origins previously unexplained phenomena show key < c+alpha > dislocation < c+alpha > indicates magnitude direction slip metastable easy-glide pyramidal ii planes; find undergoes thermally activated stress-dependent transition one three lower-energy basal-dissociated immobile dislocation structures contribute plastic straining serve strong obstacles motion dislocations transition intrinsic magnesium driven reduction dislocation energy predicted occur high frequency room temperature thus eliminating major dislocation slip systems able contribute c-axis strain leading high hardening low ductility magnesium enhanced ductility can thus achieved increasing time temperature transition easy-glide metastable dislocation immobile basal-dissociated structures occurs results provide underlying insights needed guide design ductile magnesium alloys
