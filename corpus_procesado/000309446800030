oyster genome reveals stress adaptation complexity shell formation 
pacific oyster crassostrea gigas belongs one species-rich genomically poorly explored phyla mollusca report sequencing assembly oyster genome using short reads fosmid-pooling strategy along transcriptomes development stress response proteome shell oyster genome highly polymorphic rich repetitive sequences transposable elements still actively shaping variation transcriptome studies reveal extensive set genes responding environmental stress expansion genes coding heat shock protein inhibitors apoptosis probably central oysters adaptation sessile life highly stressful intertidal zone analyses also show shell formation molluscs complex currently understood involves extensive participation cells exosomes oyster genome sequence fills void understanding lophotrochozoa
