reconstructing past climate noisy data
empirical reconstructions northern hemisphere nh temperature past millennium based multiproxy records depict small-amplitude variations followed clear warming trend past two centuries use coupled atmosphere-ocean model simulation past years surrogate climate test skill methods particularly multi-decadal centennial time scales idealized proxy records represented simulated grid-point temperature degraded statistical noise centennial variability nh temperature underestimated regression-based methods applied suggesting past variations may least factor larger indicated empirical reconstructions
