characterization multipartite entanglement one photon shared among four optical modes 
access genuine multipartite entanglement quantum states enables advances quantum information science also contributes understanding strongly correlated quantum systems report detection characterization heralded entanglement multipartite quantum state composed four spatially distinct optical modes share one photon so-called w state randomizing relative phase bipartite components w state observed transitions four three two-mode entanglement increasing phase noise observations possible system entanglement verification protocol makes use quantum uncertainty relations detect entangled states span hilbert space interest
