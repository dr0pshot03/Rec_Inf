targeted gene correction alpha-antitrypsin deficiency induced pluripotent stem cells
human induced pluripotent stem cells ipscs represent unique opportunity regenerative medicine offer prospect generating unlimited quantities cells autologous transplantation potential application treatments broad range disorders- however use human ipscs context genetically inherited human disease will require correction disease-causing mutations manner fully compatible clinical applications methods currently available homologous recombination lack necessary efficiency also leave residual sequences targeted genome therefore development new approaches edit mammalian genome prerequisite delivering clinical promise human ipscs show combination zinc finger nucleases zfns piggybac technology human ipscs can achieve biallelic correction point mutation glu342lys alpha-antitrypsin a1at also known serpina1 gene responsible alpha-antitrypsin deficiency genetic correction human ipscs restored structure function a1at subsequently derived liver cells vitro vivo approach significantly efficient gene-targeting technology currently available crucially prevents contamination host genome residual non-human sequences results provide first proof principle knowledge potential combining human ipscs genetic correction generate clinically relevant cells autologous cell-based therapies
