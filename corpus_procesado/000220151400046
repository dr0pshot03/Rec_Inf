columnar architecture sculpted gaba circuits developing cat visual cortex
mammalian visual cortex organized columns examine cortical influences upon developing visual afferents cat altering intrinsic gamma-aminobutyric acid gaba-mediated inhibition benzodiazepines local enhancement agonist diazepam infusion perturb visual responsiveness widen column spacing inverse agonist dmcm produced opposite effect thus intracortical inhibitory circuits shape geometry incoming thalamic arbors suggesting cortical columnar architecture depends neuronal activity
