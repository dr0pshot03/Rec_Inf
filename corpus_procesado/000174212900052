divided cytochrome oxidase: map projections v1 v2 macaques
current models partition primate visual system dorsal magno ventral parvo konio streams perhaps strongest evidence idea come pattern projections primary visual area v1 second visual area v2 prior studies describe three distinct pathways: magno thick stripes parvo pate stripes konio thin stripes now demonstrate v1 output arises just two sources: patch columns interpatch columns patch columns project thin stripes interpatch columns project pate thick stripes projection interpatches common v2-stripe types pate thick merges parvo magno inputs making likely functional channels distributed strongly dorsal ventral streams
