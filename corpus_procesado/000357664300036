3d-printed functionally graded soft robot powered combustion 
roboticists begun design biologically inspired robots soft partially soft bodies potential robust adaptable safer human interaction traditional rigid robots however key challenges design manufacture soft robots include complex fabrication processes interfacing soft rigid components used multimaterial three-dimensional 3d printing manufacture combustion-powered robot whose body transitions rigid core soft exterior stiffness gradient spanning three orders magnitude modulus enables reliable interfacing rigid driving components controller battery etc primarily soft body also enhances performance powered combustion butane oxygen robot able perform untethered jumping
