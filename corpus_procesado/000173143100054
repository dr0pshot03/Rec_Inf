mediation hippocampal mossy fiber long-term potentiation presynaptic i-h channels
hippocampal mossy fiber long-term potentiation ltp expressed presynaptically exact mechanisms remain unknown demonstrate involvement hyperpolarization-activated cation channel i-h expression mossy fiber ltp established ltp blocked reversed i-h channel antagonists whole-cell recording granule cells revealed repetitive stimulation causes calcium i-h-dependent long-lasting depolarization mediated protein kinase depolarization terminals expected enhance transmitter release whereas somatic depolarization enhance responsiveness granule cells afferent input thus i-h channels play important rote long-lasting control transmitter release neuronal excitability
