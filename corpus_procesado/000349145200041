rational strategy realization chain-growth supramolecular polymerization 
past decade major progress supramolecular polymerization substantial effect design functional soft materials however despite recent advances studies still based preconceived notion supramolecular polymerization follows step-growth mechanism precludes control chain length sequence stereochemical structure report realization chain-growth polymerization designing metastable monomers shape-promoted intramolecular hydrogen-bonding network monomers conformationally restricted spontaneous polymerization ambient temperatures begin polymerize characteristics typical living mechanism upon mixing tailored initiators chain growth occurs stereoselectively therefore enables optical resolution racemic monomer
