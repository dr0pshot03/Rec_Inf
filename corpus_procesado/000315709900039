quantum spintronics: engineering manipulating atom-like spins semiconductors 
past decade seen remarkable progress isolating controlling quantum coherence using charges spins semiconductors quantum control established room temperature electron spin coherence times now exceed several seconds nine-order-of-magnitude increase coherence compared first semiconductor qubits coherence times rival traditionally found atomic systems ushering new era ultracoherent spintronics review recent advances quantum measurements coherent control generation entangled states describe challenges remain processing quantum information spins semiconductors
