coupled oscillators control morning evening locomotor behaviour drosophila
daily rhythms physiology behaviour precisely timed endogenous circadian clock include separate bouts morning evening activity characteristic drosophila melanogaster many taxa including mammals- whereas multiple oscillators long proposed orchestrate complex behavioural programmes nature interplay remained elusive using cell-specific ablation show timing morning evening activity drosophila derives two distinct groups circadian neurons: morning activity ventral lateral neurons express neuropeptide pdf evening activity another group cells including dorsal lateral neurons although two oscillators can function autonomously cell-specific rescue experiments circadian clock mutants indicate functionally coupled
