discovery saturation analysis cancer genes across tumour types 
although cancer genes mutated high proportion tumours given type >% mutated intermediate frequencies -% explore feasibility creating comprehensive catalogue cancer genes analysed somatic point mutations exome sequences human cancers matched normal-tissue samples across cancer types found large-scale genomic analysis can identify nearly known cancer genes tumour types analysis also identified genes previously known significantly mutated cancer including genes related proliferation apoptosis genome stability chromatin regulation immune evasion rna processing protein homeostasis down-sampling analysis indicates larger sample sizes will reveal many genes mutated clinically important frequencies estimate near-saturation may achieved samples per tumour type depending background mutation frequency results may help guide next stage cancer genomics
