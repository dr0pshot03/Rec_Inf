ultrahigh strength nanocrystalline materials shock loading 
molecular dynamics simulations nanocrystalline copper shock loading show unexpected ultrahigh strength behind shock front values lip twice low pressure partial perfect dislocations twinning debris dislocation interactions found behind shock front results interpreted terms pressure dependence deformation mechanisms active grain sizes namely dislocation-based plasticity grain boundary sliding simulations together new shock experiments nanocrystalline nickel raise possibility achieving ultrahard materials shock loading
