pathway complexity supramolecular polymerization
self-assembly provides attractive route functional organic materials properties hence performance depending sensitively organization molecular building blocks- molecular organization direct consequence pathways involved supramolecular assembly process amenable detailed study using one-dimensional systems case protein fibrils formation growth attributed complex aggregation pathways- go beyond traditional concepts homogeneous- secondary - nucleation events self-assembly synthetic supramolecular polymers also studied even modulated- quantitative understanding processes involved remains limited report time-resolved observations formation supramolecular polymers pi-conjugated oligomers kinetic experiments show presence kinetically favoured metastable assembly forms quickly transforms thermodynamically favoured form quantitative insight kinetic experiments obtained kinetic model calculations revealed two parallel competing pathways leading assemblies opposite helicity insights prompt us use chiral tartaric acid auxiliary change thermodynamic preference assembly process find can force aggregation completely kinetically favoured pathway removal auxiliary obtain metastable assemblies
