rapid membrane disruption perforin-like protein facilitates parasite exit host cells 
perforin-like proteins expressed many bacterial protozoan pathogens yet little known function mode action describe toxoplasma perforin like protein tgplp1 secreted perforin like protein intracellular protozoan pathogen toxoplasma gondii displays structural features necessary pore formation intracellular growth tgplp1 deficient parasites failed exit normally resulting entrapment within host cells show defect due inability rapidly permeabilize parasitophorous vacuole membrane host plasma membrane exit tgplp1 ablation little effect growth culture resulted reduction greater five orders magnitude acute virulence mice perforin like proteins intracellular pathogens may play similar role microbial egress virulence
