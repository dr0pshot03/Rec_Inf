triangular fibonacci number patterns driven stress core/shell microstructures 
fibonacci number patterns triangular patterns intrinsic defects occur frequently nonplanar surfaces nature particularly plants controlling geometry stress upon cooling patterns can reproduced surface microstructures micrometers diameter spherules ag core/siox shell structure possessing markedly uniform size shape self-assembled fibonacci number patterns triangular pattern depending geometry primary supporting surface proper geometrical constraints patterns developed self-assembly order minimize total strain energy demonstrates highly ordered microstructures can prepared simultaneously across large areas stress engineering
