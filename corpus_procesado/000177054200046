delocalization protons liquid water
find vibrational potential o-h stretch vibrations liquid water shows extreme anharmonicity arises o-hhydrogen bond interaction observe already second excited state o-h stretch vibration hydrogen atom becomes delocalized oxygen atoms two neighboring water molecules energy required delocalization unexpectedly low corresponds less % dissociation energy o-h bond water molecule gas phase
