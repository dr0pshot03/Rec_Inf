tissue cells feel respond stiffness substrate 
normal tissue cells generally viable suspended fluid therefore said anchorage dependent cells must adhere solid solid can rigid glass softer babys skin behavior cells soft materials characteristic important phenotypes example cell growth soft agar gels used identify cancer cells however understanding tissue cells-including fibroblasts myocytes neurons cell types-sense matrix stiffness just emerging quantitative studies cells adhering gels cells elasticity can tuned approximate tissues key roles molecular pathways played adhesion complexes actin-myosin cytoskeleton whose contractile forces transmitted transcellular structures feedback local matrix stiffness cell state likely important implications development differentiation disease regeneration
