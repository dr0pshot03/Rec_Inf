evidence mechanisms fin development evolved midline early vertebrates
origin paired appendages major evolutionary innovation vertebrates marking first step towards fin later limb- driven locomotion earliest vertebrate fossils lack paired fins well-developed median fins suggesting mechanisms fin development assembled first midline show shark median fin development involves genetic programs operate paired appendages using molecular markers different cell types show median fins arise predominantly somitic paraxial mesoderm whereas paired appendages develop lateral plate mesoderm expression hoxd tbx18 genes specify paired limb positions also delineates positions median fins proximodistal development median fins occurs beneath apical ectodermal ridge structure controls outgrowth paired appendages- median fin bud acquires anteroposteriorly-nested pattern hoxd expression similar establishes skeletal polarity limbs thus despite different embryonic origins paired median fins utilize common suite developmental mechanisms extended analysis lampreys diverged lineage leading gnathostomes origin paired appendages show median fins also develop somites express orthologous hox tbx genes together results suggest molecular mechanisms fin development originated somitic mesoderm early vertebrates origin paired appendages associated re-deployment mechanisms lateral plate mesoderm
