general process situ formation functional surface layers ceramics
ceramics often prepared surface layers different composition bulk order impart specific functionality surface act protective layer bulk material describe general process functional surface layers nanometre-scale compositional gradient can readily formed production bulk ceramic components basis approach incorporate selected low-molecular-mass additives either precursor polymer ceramic forms binder polymer used prepare bulk components ceramic powders thermal treatment resulting bodies leads controlled phase separation bleed additives analogous normally undesirable outward loss low-molecular-mass components plastics- subsequent calcination stabilizes compositionally changed surface region generating functional surface layer approach applicable wide range materials morphologies find use catalysts composites environmental barrier coatings
