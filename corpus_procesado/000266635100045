mcsb protein arginine kinase phosphorylates inhibits heat-shock regulator ctsr 
living organisms face variety environmental stresses cause misfolding aggregation proteins eliminate damaged proteins cells developed highly efficient stress response protein quality control systems performed biochemical structural analysis bacterial ctsr/mcsb stress response crystal structure ctsr repressor complex dna pinpointed key residues important high-affinity binding promoter regions heat-shock genes moreover biochemical characterization mcsb revealed mcsb specifically phosphorylates arginine residues dna binding domain ctsr thereby impairing function repressor stress response genes identification ctsr/mcsb arginine phospho-switch expands repertoire possible protein modifications involved prokaryotic eukaryotic transcriptional regulation
