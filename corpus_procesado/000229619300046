directed assembly block copolymer blends nonregular device-oriented structures
self-assembly effective strategy creation periodic structures nanoscale however microelectronic devices use free-form design principles insertion point self-assembling materials existing nano-manufacturing processes unclear directed ternary blends diblock copolymers homopolymers naturally form periodic arrays assemble nonregular device-oriented structures chemically nanopatterned substrates redistribution homopolymer facilitates defect-free assembly locations domain dimensions deviate substantially formed bulk ability pattern nonregular structures using self-assembling materials creates new opportunities nanoscale manufacturing
