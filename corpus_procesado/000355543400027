prefrontal-thalamo-hippocampal circuit goal-directed spatial navigation 
spatial navigation requires information relationship current future positions activity hippocampal neurons appears reflect relationship representing instantaneous position also path towards goal location however hippocampus obtains information goal direction poorly understood report prefrontal-thalamic neural circuit required hippocampal representation routes trajectories environment trajectory-dependent firing observed medial prefrontal cortex nucleus reuniens thalamus ca1 region hippocampus rats lesioning optogenetic silencing nucleus reuniens substantially reduced trajectory-dependent ca1 firing trajectory-dependent activity almost absent ca3 receive nucleus reuniens input data suggest projections medial prefrontal cortex via nucleus reuniens crucial representation future path goal-directed behaviour point thalamus key node networks long-range communication cortical regions involved navigation
