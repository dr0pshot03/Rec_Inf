soil biota exotic plant invasion
invasive plants economic problem threat conservation natural systems escape natural enemies might contribute successful invasion work emphasizing role insect herbivores- however microbial pathogens attracting increased attention soil biota invaded ecosystems may promote exotic invasion- plant-soil feedback processes also important thus relatively rare species native north america consistently demonstrate negative feedbacks soil microbes promote biological diversity whereas abundant exotic native species demonstrate positive feedbacks reduce biological diversity report soil microbes home range invasive exotic plant centaurea maculosa l stronger inhibitory effects growth soil microbes weed invaded north america centaurea soil microbes participate different plant-soil feedback processes home compared outside centaureas home range native european soils centaurea cultivates soil biota increasingly negative effects weeds growth possibly leading control soils north america centaurea cultivates soil biota increasingly positive effects may contribute success exotic species north america
