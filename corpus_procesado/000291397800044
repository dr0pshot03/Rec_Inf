direct measurement quantum wavefunction 
wavefunction complex distribution used completely describe quantum system central quantum theory despite fundamental role typically introduced abstract element theory explicit definition12 rather physicists come working understanding wavefunction use calculate measurement outcome probabilities way born rule3 present wavefunction determined tomographic methods4- estimate wavefunction consistent diverse collection measurements indirectness methods compounds problem defining wavefunction show wavefunction can measured directly sequential measurement two complementary variables system crux method first measurement performed gentle way weak measurement9- invalidate second result real imaginary components wavefunction appear directly measurement apparatus give experimental example directly measuring transverse spatial wavefunction single photon task previously realized method show concept universal applicable degrees freedom photon polarization frequency quantum systems-for example electron spins squids superconducting quantum interference devices trapped ions consequently method gives wavefunction straightforward general definition terms specific set experimental operations19 expect expand range quantum systems can characterized initiate new avenues fundamental quantum theory
