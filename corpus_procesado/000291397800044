direct measurement quantum wavefunction
wavefunction complex distribution used completely describe quantum system central quantum theory despite fundamental role typically introduced abstract element theory explicit definition rather physicists come working understanding wavefunction use calculate measurement outcome probabilities way born rule present wavefunction determined tomographic methods- estimate wavefunction consistent diverse collection measurements indirectness methods compounds problem defining wavefunction show wavefunction can measured directly sequential measurement two complementary variables system crux method first measurement performed gentle way weak measurement- invalidate second result real imaginary components wavefunction appear directly measurement apparatus give experimental example directly measuring transverse spatial wavefunction single photon task previously realized method show concept universal applicable degrees freedom photon polarization frequency quantum systems-for example electron spins squids superconducting quantum interference devices trapped ions consequently method gives wavefunction straightforward general definition terms specific set experimental operations expect expand range quantum systems can characterized initiate new avenues fundamental quantum theory
