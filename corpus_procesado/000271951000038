microsecond simulations spontaneous methane hydrate nucleation growth 
despite industrial implications worldwide abundance gas hydrates formation mechanism compounds remains poorly understood report direct molecular dynamics simulations spontaneous nucleation growth methane hydrate multiple-microsecond trajectories offer detailed insight process hydrate nucleation cooperative organization observed lead methane adsorption onto planar faces water fluctuating formation dissociation early hydrate cages early cages mostly face-sharing partial small cages favoring structure ii however larger cages subsequently appear result steric constraints thermodynamic preference structure phase resulting structure nucleation growth combination two dominant types hydrate crystals structure structure ii linked uncommon cages facilitate structure coexistence without energetically unfavorable interface
