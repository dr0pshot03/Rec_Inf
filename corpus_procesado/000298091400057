inhibitory plasticity balances excitation inhibition sensory pathways memory networks
cortical neurons receive balanced excitatory inhibitory synaptic currents balance established maintained experience-dependent manner synaptic plasticity inhibitory synapses show mechanism provides explanation sparse firing patterns observed response natural stimuli fits well recently observed interaction excitatory inhibitory receptive field plasticity introduction inhibitory plasticity suitable recurrent networks provides homeostatic mechanism leads asynchronous irregular network states can accommodate synaptic memories activity patterns become indiscernible background state can reactivated external stimuli results suggest essential role inhibitory plasticity formation maintenance functional cortical circuitry
