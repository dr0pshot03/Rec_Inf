perception root-derived peptides shoot lrr-rks mediates systemic n-demand signaling
nitrogen n critical nutrient plants often distributed unevenly soil plants therefore evolved systemic mechanism n starvation one side root system leads compensatory increased nitrate uptake side study molecular systems support perception n long-distance signaling needed alter root development rootlets starved n secrete small peptides translocated shoot received two leucine-rich repeat receptor kinases lrr-rks arabidopsis plants deficient pathway show growth retardation accompanied n-deficiency symptoms thus signaling root shoot helps plant adapt fluctuations local n availability
