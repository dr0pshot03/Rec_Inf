grain boundary strengthening alumina rare earth impurities 
impurity doping often alters improves properties materials alumina grain boundaries play key rote deformation mechanisms particularly phenomenon grain boundary sliding creep high temperatures elucidated atomic-scale structure alumina grain boundaries relationship suppression creep upon doping yttrium using atomic resolution microscopy high-precision calculations find yttrium segregates localized regions along grain boundary alters local bonding environment thereby strengthening boundary mechanical creep
