rad6-dependent ubiquitination histone h2b yeast
although ubiquitinated histones present substantial levels vertebrate cells roles play specific biological processes cellular factors regulate modification well characterized ubiquitinated h2b uh2b identified yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae mutation conserved ubiquitination site shown confer defects mitotic cell growth meiosis uh2b detected rad6 mutants defective ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme ubc2 thus identifying rad6 major cellular activity ubiquitinates h2b yeast
