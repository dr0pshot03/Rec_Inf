thyroid hormone-dependent adult pigment cell lineage pattern zebrafish
pigment patterns useful elucidating fundamental mechanisms pattern formation mechanisms evolve zebrafish several pigment cell classes interact generate stripes yet developmental requirements origins cells remain poorly understood using zebrafish related species identified roles thyroid hormone th pigment cell development patterning postembryonic development generally show adult pigment cells arise distinct lineages distinct requirements th differential th dependence can evolve within lineages findings demonstrate critical functions th determining pigment pattern phenotype highlight potential evolutionary diversification intersection developmental endocrine mechanisms
