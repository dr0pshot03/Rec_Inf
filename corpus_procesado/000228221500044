neuronal coherence mechanism effective corticospinal interaction
neuronal groups can interact even widely separated one group might modulate firing rate internal oscillatory synchronization influence another group propose coherence two neuronal groups mechanism efficient interaction renders mutual input optimally timed thereby maximally effective modulations subjects readiness respond simple reaction-time task closely correlated strength gamma-band hertz coherence motor cortex spinal cord neurons coherence may contribute effective corticospinal interaction shortened reaction times
