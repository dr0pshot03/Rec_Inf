highly evolvable malaria vectors: genomes anopheles mosquitoes 
variation vectorial capacity human malaria among anopheles mosquito species determined many factors including behavior immunity life history investigate genomic basis vectorial capacity explore new avenues vector control sequenced genomes anopheline mosquito species diverse locations spanning similar million years evolution comparative analyses show faster rates gene gain loss elevated gene shuffling x chromosome intron losses relative drosophila determinants vectorial capacity chemosensory genes show elevated turnover instead diversify protein-sequence changes dynamism anopheline genes genomes may contribute flexible capacity take advantage new ecological niches including adapting humans primary hosts
