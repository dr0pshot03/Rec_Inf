rna interference screen uncovers new molecule stem cell self-renewal long-term regeneration
adult stem cells sustain tissue maintenance regeneration throughout lifetime animal cells often reside specific signalling niches orchestrate stem cells balancing act quiescence cell-cycle re-entry based demand tissue regeneration- stem cells maintain capacity replenish tissue regeneration poorly understood use rna-interference-based loss-of-function screening powerful approach uncover transcriptional regulators govern self-renewal capacity regenerative potential stem cells hair follicle stem cells provide ideal model cells purified characterized native niche vivo contrast rapidly dividing progeny can maintained passaged long-term vitro- focusing nuclear proteins and/or transcription factors enriched stem cells compared progeny screened similar short hairpin rnas effect long-term short-term stem cell self-renewal vitro address physiological relevance findings selected one candidate uncovered screen: tbx1 transcription factor expressed many tissues studied context stem cell biology conditionally ablating tbx1 vivo showed homeostasis tissue regeneration occurs normally markedly delayed devised vivo assay stem cell replenishment found challenged repetitive rounds regeneration tbx1-deficient stem cell niche becomes progressively depleted addressing mechanism tbx1 action discovered tbx1 acts intrinsic rheostat bmp signalling: gatekeeper governs transition stem cell quiescence proliferation hair follicles results validate rna interference screen underscore power unearthing new molecules govern stem cell self-renewal tissue-regenerative potential
