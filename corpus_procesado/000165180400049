cell-cycle-regulated dna double-strand breaks somatic hypermutation immunoglobulin genes 
targeted hypermutation immunoglobulin variable region genes occurs b cells immune response gives rise families related mutant antibodies selected binding affinity immunizing antigen somatic hypermutation predominantly generates point mutations many occur specific residues hotspots reaction linked transcription requires presence immunoglobulin enhancers- replacement variable gene heterologous sequences variable region promoter heterologous promoter interfere mutation process show existence abundant dna double-strand breaks dsbs hypermutating sequences generation dsbs coupled transcription enhancer-dependent correlates appearance nearby mutations furthermore dsbs cell-cycle restricted found almost exclusively cells completed nearly completed dna replication propose model somatic hypermutation mutations introduced dna repair dsbs homologous recombination finding dsbs somatic hypermutation may help explain chromosomal translocations found b-cell tumours
