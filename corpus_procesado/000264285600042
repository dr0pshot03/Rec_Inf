comprehensive polymorphism survey elucidates population structure saccharomyces cerevisiae 
comprehensive identification polymorphisms among individuals within species essential studying genetic basis phenotypic differences elucidating evolutionary history species large-scale polymorphism surveys recently reported human mouse arabidopsis thaliana report nucleotide-level survey genomic variation diverse collection saccharomyces cerevisiae strains sampled different ecological niches beer bread vineyards immunocompromised individuals various fermentations nature locations different continents hybridized genomic dna strain whole-genome tiling microarrays detected million single nucleotide polymorphisms grouped distinct segregating sites also identified deletion events length > base pairs among surveyed strains analysed genome-wide patterns nucleotide polymorphism deletion variants measured extent linkage disequilibrium s cerevisiae results polymorphism resource generated lay foundation genome-wide association studies yeast also examined population structure s cerevisiae providing support multiple domestication events well insight origins pathogenic strains
