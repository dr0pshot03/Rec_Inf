foundering lower island-arc crust explanation origin continental moho 
long-standing theory genesis continental crust formed subduction zones however observed seismic properties lower crust upper mantle oceanic island arcs differ significantly continental crust accordingly significant modifications lower arc crust must occur continental crust indeed formed island arcs investigate seismic characteristics arc crust transformed continental crust calculating density seismic structure two exposed sections island arc kohistan talkeetna kohistan crustal section negatively buoyant respect underlying depleted upper mantle depths exceeding kilometres characterized steady increase seismic velocity similar observed active arcs contrast lower talkeetna crust density sorted preserving relicts ten hundred metres thick rock density exceeding underlying mantle specifically foundering lower talkeetna crust resulted replacement dense mafic ultramafic cumulates residual upper mantle producing sharp seismic discontinuity depths around kilometres characteristic continental mohorovicic discontinuity moho dynamic calculations indicate foundering episodic process occurs arcs periodicity half million five million years moreover foundering will continue arc magmatism ceases process ultimately results formation continental moho
