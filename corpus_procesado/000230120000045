gdf11 controls timing progenitor cell competence developing retina
orderly generation cell types developing retina thought regulated changes competence multipotent progenitors show secreted factor growth differentiation factor gdf11 controls numbers retinal ganglion cells rgcs well amacrine photoreceptor cells form development gdf11 affect proliferation progenitors-a major mode gdf11 action tissues-but instead controls duration expression maths gene confers competence rgc genesis progenitor cells thus gdf11 governs temporal windows multipotent progenitors retain competence produce distinct neural progeny
