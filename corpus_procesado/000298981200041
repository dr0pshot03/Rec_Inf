basic amino-acid side chains regulate transmembrane integrin signalling
side chains lys/arg near transmembrane domain tmd- membrane-water interfaces can snorkel placing positive charge near negatively charged phospholipid head groups- however snorkellings functional effects obscure integrin beta tmds conserved basic amino acids use nmr spectroscopy show integrin betalys helps determine beta tmd topography alphaiibbeta tmd structure indicates precise beta tmd crossing angles enable assembly outer inner membrane clasps hold ab tmd together limit transmembrane signalling mutation betalys caused dissociation alphaiibbeta tmds integrin activation confirm altered topography betalys mutants activated alphaiibbeta used directed evolution betak716a identify substitutions restoring default state introduction pro midpoint beta tmd a711p increased alphaiibbeta tmd association inactivated integrin alphaiibbetaa711p k716a betapro introduced tmd kink +/ degrees precisely border outer inner membrane clasps thereby decoupling tilt segments thus widely occurring snorkelling residues tmds can help maintain tmd topography membrane-embedding thereby regulating transmembrane signalling
