ultra-relativistic outflow neutron star accreting gas companion
collimated relativistic outflows-also known jets-are amongst energetic phenomena universe associated supermassive black holes distant active galactic nuclei accreting stellar-mass black holes neutron stars binary systems believed responsible gamma-ray bursts physics jets however remains something mystery bulk velocities compositions energetics remain poorly determined report discovery ultra-relativistic outflow neutron star accreting gas within binary stellar system velocity outflow comparable fastest-moving flows observed active galactic nuclei strength modulated rate accretion material onto neutron star shocks energized downstream flow moving mildly relativistic bulk velocities sites observed synchrotron emission jet conclude generation highly relativistic outflows require properties unique black holes event horizon
