yeast hybrid provides insight evolution gene expression regulation
evolution novel phenotypes emerge changes gene expression genetic basis poorly understood compared allele-specific expression two yeast species hybrid allowed us distinguish changes regulatory sequences gene cis changes upstream regulatory factors trans expression divergence species generally due changes cis divergence trans reflected differential response environment explained tendency certain genes diverge rapidly hybrid-specific expression deviating parental range occurred novel cis-trans interactions often modified trans regulation associated environmental sensing results provide insights regulatory changes cis trans divergence species upon hybridization
