simplest realization brownian motion colloidal sphere moves randomly isotropic fluid; mean squared displacement msd grows linearly time tau brownian motion orientationally ordered fluid-a nematic-is anisotropic msd larger along axis molecular orientation called director found short time scales anisotropic diffusion nematic becomes anomalous msd growing slower faster t; states respectively termed subdiffusion superdiffusion anomalous diffusion occurs time scales correspond relaxation times director deformations around sphere nematic melts diffusion becomes normal isotropic experiment shows deformations fluctuations long-range orientational order profoundly influence diffusive regimes
