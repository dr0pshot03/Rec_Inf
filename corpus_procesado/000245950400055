expanding diversity chemical protein modification allows post-translational mimicry
one important current scientific paradoxes economy nature uses genes higher animals studied found many fewer genes previously expected functional outputs eventual products genes seem far complex restricted blueprint higher organisms functions many proteins modulated post-translational modifications ptms alterations amino-acid side chains lead higher structural functional protein diversity therefore leading contender explanation seeming incongruity natural protein production methods typically produce ptm mixtures within function difficult dissect control now possible access pure mimics complex ptms report chemical tagging approach enables attachment multiple modifications bacterially expressed bare protein scaffolds: approach allows reconstitution functionally effective mimics higher organism ptms attaching appropriate modifications suitable distances widely-used lacz reporter enzyme scaffold created protein probes included sensitive systems detection mammalian brain inflammation disease target synthesis desired modification chemistry provides structural precision ability retool chosen ptm manner available approaches way combining chemical control ptm readily available protein scaffolds provides systematic platform creating probes protein ptm interactions therefore anticipate ability build model systems will allow gene product complexity dissected aim eventually able completely duplicate patterns particular proteins ptms vivo assay vitro system
