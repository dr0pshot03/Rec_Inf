failure confirm xmrv/mlvs blood patients chronic fatigue syndrome: multi-laboratory study 
murine leukemia viruses mlvs including xenotropic-mlv-related virus xmrv controversially linked chronic fatigue syndrome cfs explore issue greater depth compiled coded replicate samples blood subjects previously reported xmrv/mlv-positive cfs healthy donors previously determined negative viruses samples distributed blinded fashion nine laboratories performed assays designed detect xmrv/mlv nucleic acid virus replication antibody two laboratories reported evidence xmrv/mlvs however replicate sample results showed disagreement reactivity similar among cfs subjects negative controls results indicate current assays reproducibly detect xmrv/mlv blood samples blood donor screening warranted
