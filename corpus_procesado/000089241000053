activation heat-shock response adenovirus essential virus replication 
successful viral infection requires viruses redirect host biochemistry replicate viral genome produce assemble progeny virions cellular heat-shock responses characterized elevation relocalization heat-shock proteins occur replication many viruses- responses might host reactions synthesis foreign protein might irrelevant consequences viral need activate transcription alternatively heat-shock proteins can facilitate protein folding activating heat-shock response might specific virus function ensuring proper synthesis viral proteins virions possible determine whether heat-shock response essential virus replication implicated viral genes ad5 e1a ref also control essential replication steps report expression gam1 protein encoded avian virus celo ref elevates relocalizes hsp70 hsp40 gam1-negative celo replication-defective however gam1 function can partially replaced either heat shock forced hsp40 expression thus essential function gam1 virus replication activate host heat-shock responses hsp40 primary target
