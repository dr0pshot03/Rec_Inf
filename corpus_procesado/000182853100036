chaos-assisted capture irregular moons
thought- capture irregular moons non-circular orbits giant planets occurs process first temporarily trapped gravity inside planets hill sphere region planetary gravity dominates solar tides capture moons made permanent dissipative energy loss example gas drag planetary growth observed distributions orbital inclinations now include numerous newly discovered moons- explained using current models show irregular satellites captured thin spatial region orbits chaotic resulting orbit either prograde retrograde depending initial energy dissipation switches long-lived chaotic orbits nearby regular non-chaotic zones escape impossible chaotic layer therefore dictates final inclinations captured moons confirm three-dimensional monte carlo simulations include nebular drag find good agreement observed inclination distributions irregular moons jupiter saturn particular saturn prograde irregular moons jupiter can explain result chaotic prograde progenitors efficiently swept away jupiter galilean moons
