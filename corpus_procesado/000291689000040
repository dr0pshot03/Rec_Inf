shallow dynamic overshoot energetic deep rupture m-w tohoku-oki earthquake
strong spatial variation rupture characteristics moment magnitude m-w tohoku-oki megathrust earthquake controlled strength shaking size tsunami followed finite-source imaging reveals rupture consisted small initial phase deep rupture seconds extensive shallow rupture seconds continuing deep rupture lasting seconds combination shallow dipping fault compliant hanging wall may enabled large shallow slip near trench normal faulting aftershocks area high slip suggest dynamic overshoot fault despite prodigious total slip shallower parts rupture weakly radiated high frequencies whereas deeper parts rupture radiated strongly high frequencies
