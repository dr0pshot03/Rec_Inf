synthetic gene networks count
synthetic gene networks can constructed emulate digital circuits devices giving one ability program design cells principles modern computing counting cellular counter enable complex synthetic programming variety biotechnology applications report two complementary synthetic genetic counters escherichia coli can count three induction events: first riboregulated transcriptional cascade second recombinase-based cascade memory units modular devices permit counting varied user-defined inputs range frequencies can expanded count higher numbers
