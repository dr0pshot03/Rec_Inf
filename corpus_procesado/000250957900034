mobile robots: motor challenges materials solutions 
bolted-down robots labor factories performing task robots run jump equaling human performance difficult many reasons including basic challenge demonstrating motors transmissions efficiently match power per unit mass muscle order exceed animal agility new actuators needed materials change dimension response applied voltage so-called artificial muscle technologies outperform muscle respects provide promising means improving robots longer term robots powered atomically perfect fibers will outrun us
