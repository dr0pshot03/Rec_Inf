structural transitions elasticity torque measurements dna
knowledge elastic properties dna required understand structural dynamics cellular processes replication transcription measurements force extension single molecules dna- allowed direct determination molecules mechanical properties provided rigorous tests theories polymer elasticity revealed unforeseen structural transitions induced mechanical stresses- established experimental conceptual framework mechanical assays enzymes act dna however complete description dna mechanics must also consider effects torque quantity hitherto directly measured micromanipulation experiments measured torque function twist stretched dna-torsional strain underwound molecules used power rotation submicrometre beads serving calibrated loads report tests linearity dnas twist elasticity direct measurements torsional modulus finding value similar to40% higher generally accepted characterization torque-induced structural transitions establishment framework future assays torque twist generation dna-dependent enzymes also show cooperative structural transitions dna can exploited construct constant-torque wind-up motors force-torque converters
