cortical connectivity sensory coding 
sensory cortex contains wide array neuronal types connected together complex partially stereotyped circuits sensory stimuli trigger cascades electrical activity circuits causing specific features sensory scenes encoded firing patterns cortical populations recent research beginning reveal connectivity individual neurons relates sensory features encode differences connectivity patterns different cortical cell classes enable encode information using different strategies feedback connections higher-order cortex allow sensory information integrated behavioural context
