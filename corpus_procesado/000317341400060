interactions nucleus accumbens auditory cortices predict music reward value
used functional magnetic resonance imaging investigate neural processes music gains reward value first time heard degree activity mesolimbic striatal regions especially nucleus accumbens music listening best predictor amount listeners willing spend previously unheard music auction paradigm importantly auditory cortices amygdala ventromedial prefrontal regions showed increased activity listening conditions requiring valuation predict reward value instead predicted increasing functional connectivity regions nucleus accumbens reward value increased thus aesthetic rewards arise interaction mesolimbic reward circuitry cortical networks involved perceptual analysis valuation
