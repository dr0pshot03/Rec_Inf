evidence high frequency simultaneous double-nucleotide substitutions 
point mutations generally assumed involve changes single nucleotides nevertheless nature known mechanisms mutation exclude possibility several adjacent nucleotides may change simultaneously single mutational event two independent approaches used estimate frequency simultaneous double-nucleotide substitutions first examines switches tcn acy n nucleotide y pyrimidine codons encoding absolutely conserved serine residues number proteins diverse organisms second reveals double-nucleotide substitutions primate noncoding sequences two complementary approaches provide similar high estimates rate doublet substitutions order per site per billion years
