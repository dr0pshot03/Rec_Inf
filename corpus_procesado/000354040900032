training andoperation integrated neuromorphic network based metal-oxide memristors
despite much progress semiconductor integrated circuit technology extreme complexity human cerebral cortex approximately synapses makes hardware implementation neuromorphic networks comparable number devices exceptionally challenging provide comparable complexity operating much faster manageable power dissipation networks based circuits combining complementary metaloxide-semiconductors cmoss adjustable two-terminal resistive devices memristors developed circuits usual cmos stack augmented one several crossbar layers memristors crosspoint recently notable improvements fabrication memristive crossbars integration cmos circuits- including first demonstrations vertical integration separately discrete memristors used artificial synapses neuromorphic networks- recently experiments extended crossbar arrays phase-change memristive devices adjustment devices however requires additional transistor crosspoint hence devices much harder scale metal-oxide memristors whose nonlinear current-voltage curves enable transistor-free operation report experimental implementation transistor-free metal-oxide memristor crossbars device variability sufficiently low allow operation integrated neural networks simple network: single-layer perceptron algorithm linear classification network can taught situ using coarse-grain variety delta rule algorithm perform perfect classification pixel black/white images three classes representing letters demonstration important step towards much larger complex memristive neuromorphic networks
