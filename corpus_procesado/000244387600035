focusing beyond diffraction limit far-field time reversal
present approach subwavelength focusing microwaves using time-reversal mirror placed far field random distribution scatterers placed near field focusing point far-field time-reversal mirror used build time-reversed wave field interacts random medium regenerate propagating waves also evanescent waves required refocus diffraction limit focal spots small one-thirtieth wavelength described present one example application telecommunications shows enhancement information transmission rate factor
