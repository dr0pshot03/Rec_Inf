light-avoidance-mediating photoreceptors tile drosophila larval body wall
photoreceptors visual perception phototaxis light avoidance typically clustered eyes related structures bolwig organ drosophila larvae unexpectedly found class iv dendritic arborization neurons drosophila melanogaster larvae respond ultraviolet violet blue light major mediators light avoidance particularly high intensities class iv dendritic arborization neurons present every body segment dendrites tiling larval body wall nearly completely without redundancy dendritic illumination activates class iv dendritic arborization neurons novel photoreceptors use phototransduction machinery distinct photoreceptors drosophila enable larvae sense light exposure entire bodies move danger
