-angstrom crystal structure human igg1 fc fragment-fc gamma riii complex
immune response depends binding opsonized antigens cellular fc receptors subsequent initiation various cellular effector functions immune system describe crystal structures soluble fc gamma receptor sfc gamma riii cd16 fc fragment human igg1 hfc1 complex : complex receptor binds two halves fc fragment contact residues c gamma domains hinge region upon complex formation angle two sfcgriii domains increases significantly fc fragment opens asymmetrically high degree amino acid conservation sfc gamma riii fc receptors similarly hfc1 related immunoglobulins suggest similar structures modes association thus described structure model immune complex recognition helps explain vastly differing affinities fc gamma r-igg complexes fc epsilon ri alpha-ige complex
