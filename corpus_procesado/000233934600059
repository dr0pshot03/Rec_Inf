afterglow elliptical host galaxy short gamma-ray burst grb 
despite rich phenomenology gamma-ray bursts grbs divided two classes based duration spectral hardness long-soft short-hard bursts discovery afterglow emission long grbs watershed event pinpointing origin star-forming galaxies hence death massive stars indicating energy release erg theoretical arguments suggest short grbs produced coalescence binary compact objects neutron stars black holes progenitors energetics environments events remain elusive despite recent- localizations report discovery first radio afterglow short burst grb unambiguously associates elliptical galaxy redshift z show burst powered relativistic fireball mechanism long grbs ejecta possibly collimated jets total energy release times smaller importantly nature host galaxy demonstrates short grbs arise old > gyr stellar population strengthening earlier suggestions providing support coalescing compact object binaries progenitors
