dual origin tissue-specific progenitor cells drosophila tracheal remodeling 
drosophila metamorphosis larval cells die pupal adult tissues form imaginal cells tissue specific progenitors allocated embryogenesis remain quiescent embryonic larval life clonal analysis fate mapping single identified cells show tracheal system remodeling metamorphosis involves classical imaginal cell population population differentiated functional larval tracheal cells reenter cell cycle regain developmental potency late larvae populations activated proliferate spread replace old branches diversify various stalk coiled tracheolar cells control fibroblast growth factor signaling thus drosophila pupal/ adult tissue progenitors can arise early allocation multipotent cells late return differentiated cells multipotent state even within single tissue
