three key residues form critical contact network protein folding transition state
determining protein folds central problem structural biology rate folding many proteins determined transition state knowledge structure essential understanding protein folding reaction use mutation measurements-which determine role individual residues stabilizing transition state-as restraints monte carlo sampling procedure determine ensemble structures make transition state apply approach experimental data residue protein acylphosphatase obtain transition-state ensemble native-state topology average root-mean-square deviation angstrom native structure although residues small positional fluctuations form structural core transition state native-like contact network three residues sufficient determine overall fold protein result reveals nucleation mechanism involving small number key residues can lead folding polypeptide chain unique native-state structure
