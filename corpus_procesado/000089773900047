quorum-sensing signals indicate cystic fibrosis lungs infected bacterial biofilms
bacterium pseudomonas aeruginosa permanently colonizes cystic fibrosis lungs despite aggressive antibiotic treatment- suggests p aeruginosa might exist biofilms-structured communities bacteria encased self-produced polymeric matrix-in cystic fibrosis lung consistent hypothesis microscopy cystic fibrosis sputum shows p aeruginosa biofilm-like structures p aeruginosa uses extracellular quorum-sensing signals extracellular chemical signals cue cell-density-dependent gene expression coordinate biofilm formation found cystic fibrosis sputum produces two principal p aeruginosa quorum-sensing signals however relative abundance signals opposite standard p aeruginosa strain pao1 laboratory broth culture p aeruginosa sputum isolates grown broth showed quorum-sensing signal ratios like laboratory strain grew isolates pao1 laboratory biofilm model signal ratios like cystic fibrosis sputum data support hypothesis p aeruginosa biofilm cystic fibrosis sputum moreover quorum-sensing signal profiling specific p aeruginosa strains may serve biomarker screens identify agents interfere biofilm development
