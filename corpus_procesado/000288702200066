terra hnrnpa1 orchestrate rpa-to-pot1 switch telomeric single-stranded dna 
maintenance telomeres requires dna replication telomere capping shelterin two processes use two single-stranded dna ssdna-binding proteins replication protein rpa protection telomeres pot1 although rpa pot1 critical role telomeres function concert clear pot1 ablation leads activation ataxia telangiectasia rad3-related atr checkpoint kinase telomeres suggesting pot1 antagonizes rpa binding telomeric ssdna unexpectedly found purified pot1 functional partner tpp1 unable prevent rpa binding telomeric ssdna efficiently cell extracts identified novel activity specifically displaces rpa pot1 telomeric ssdna using purified protein show heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein a1 hnrnpa1 recapitulates rpa displacing activity rpa displacing activity inhibited telomeric repeat-containing rna terra early s phase unleashed late s phase terra levels decline telomeres interestingly terra also promotes pot1 binding telomeric ssdna removing hnrnpa1 suggesting reaccumulation terra s phase helps complete rpa-to-pot1 switch telomeric ssdna together data suggest hnrnpa1 terra pot1 act concert displace rpa telomeric ssdna dna replication promote telomere capping preserve genomic integrity
