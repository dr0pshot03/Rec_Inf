deformations within moving kinetochores reveal different sites active passive force generation 
kinetochores mediate chromosome segregation mitosis thought contain active force-producing passive frictional interfaces microtubules whose relative locations unclear inferred mechanical deformation within single kinetochores metaphase oscillations measuring average separations fluorescently labeled kinetochore subunits living cells undergoing mitosis inter-subunit distances shorter kinetochores moving toward poles moving away inter-subunit separation decreased abruptly kinetochores switched poleward movement decreased pulling force increased suggesting active force generation poleward movement compresses kinetochores data revealed active force-generating interface within kinetochores separate passive frictional interface located least nanometers away poleward together interfaces allow persistent attachment intermittent active force generation
