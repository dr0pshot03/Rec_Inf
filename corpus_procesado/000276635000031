molecular basis infrared detection snakes
snakes possess unique sensory system detecting infrared radiation enabling generate thermal image predators prey infrared signals initially received pit organ highly specialized facial structure innervated nerve fibres somatosensory system organ detects transduces infrared signals nerve impulses known use unbiased transcriptional profiling approach identify trpa1 channels infrared receptors sensory nerve fibres innervate pit organ trpa1 orthologues pit-bearing snakes vipers pythons boas heat-sensitive vertebrate ion channels thus far identified consistent role primary transducers infrared stimuli thus snakes detect infrared signals mechanism involving radiant heating pit organ rather photochemical transduction findings illustrate broad evolutionary tuning transient receptor potential trp channels thermosensors vertebrate nervous system
