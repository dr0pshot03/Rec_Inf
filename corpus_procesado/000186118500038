formation first low-mass stars gas low carbon oxygen abundances
first stars universe predicted much massive sun- gravitational condensation accompanied cooling primordial gas via molecular hydrogen yields minimum fragmentation scale hundred solar masses numerical simulations indicate gas clump acquires mass undergoes slow quasihydrostatic contraction without fragmentation lowermass stars form show soon primordial gas left big bang enriched elements ejected supernovae carbon oxygen abundance small similar to0 per cent found sun cooling singly ionized carbon neutral oxygen can lead formation low-mass stars allowing cloud fragmentation smaller clumps mechanism naturally accommodates recent discovery solar-mass stars unusually low iron abundances - solar relatively high - solar carbon abundance critical abundances derive can used identify metal-poor stars galaxy elemental patterns imprinted first supernovae also find minimum stellar mass early epochs partially regulated temperature cosmic microwave background
