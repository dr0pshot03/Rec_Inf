eos mediates foxp3-dependent gene silencing cd4+ regulatory t cells 
cd4+ regulatory t cells t-regs maintain immunological self-tolerance immune homeostasis suppressing aberrant excessive immune responses core genetic program t-regs ability suppress pathologic immune responses depends transcription factor foxp3 despite progress understanding mechanisms foxp3-dependent gene activation molecular mechanism foxp3-dependent gene repression remains largely unknown identified eos zinc-finger transcription factor ikaros family critical mediator foxp3-dependent gene silencing t-regs eos interacts directly foxp3 induces chromatin modifications result gene silencing t-regs silencing eos t-regs abrogates ability suppress immune responses endows partial effector function thus demonstrating critical role eos plays t-reg programming
