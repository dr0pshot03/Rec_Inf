dbird complex integrates alternative mrna splicing rna polymerase ii transcript elongation 
alternative messenger rna splicing main reason vast mammalian proteomic complexity can achieved limited number genes splicing physically functionally coupled transcription greatly affected rate transcript elongation1- nascent pre-mrna emerges transcribing rna polymerase ii rnapii assembled messenger ribonucleoprotein mrnp particle; functional form nascent pre-mrna determines fate mature transcript4 however factors connect transcribing polymerase mrnp particle help integrate transcript elongation mrna splicing remain unclear characterize human interactome chromatin-associated mrnp particles led us identify deleted breast cancer dbc1 znf326 call znf-protein interacting nuclear mrnps dbc1 zird subunits novel protein complex-named dbird-that binds directly rnapii dbird regulates alternative splicing large set exons embedded + t-rich dna present affected exons rna-interference-mediated dbird depletion results region-specific decreases transcript elongation particularly across areas encompassing affected exons together data indicate dbird complex acts interface mrnp particles rnapii integrating transcript elongation regulation alternative splicing
