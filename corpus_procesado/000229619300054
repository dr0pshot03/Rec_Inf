kinesin dynein move peroxisome vivo: tug-of-war coordinated movement
used fluorescence imaging one nanometer accuracy fiona analyze organelle movement conventional kinesin cytoplasmic dynein cell located green fluorescence protein gfp-tagged peroxisome cultured drosophila s2 cells within nanometers milliseconds fold improvement temporal resolution sufficient determine average step size similar nanometers dynein kinesin furthermore found dynein kinesin work vivo peroxisome transport rather multiple kinesins multiple dyneins work together producing times vitro speed
