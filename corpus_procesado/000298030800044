atm controls meiotic double-strand-break formation 
many organisms developmentally programmed double-strand breaks dsbs formed spo11 transesterase initiate meiotic recombination promotes pairing segregation homologous chromosomes1 every chromosome must receive minimum number dsbs attention focused factors support dsb formation2 however improperly repaired dsbs can cause meiotic arrest mutation34; thus many dsbs probably deleterious small fraction spo11 protein ever makes dsb yeast mouse5 spo11 accessory factors remain abundant long dsb formation ceases1 implying existence mechanisms restrain spo11 activity limit dsb numbers report number meiotic dsbs mouse controlled atm kinase activated dna damage trigger checkpoint signalling promote dsb repair levels spo11-oligonucleotide complexes by-products meiotic dsb formation elevated least tenfold spermatocytes lacking atm moreover atm mutation renders spo11-oligonucleotide levels sensitive genetic manipulations modulate spo11 protein levels propose atm restrains spo11 via negative feedback loop kinase activation dsbs suppresses dsb formation findings explain previously puzzling phenotypes atm-null mice provide molecular basis gonadal dysgenesis observed ataxia telangiectasia human syndrome caused atm deficiency
