somatic mosaicism neuronal precursor cells mediated l1 retrotransposition
revealing mechanisms neuronal somatic diversification remains central challenge understanding individual differences brain organization function show engineered human line long interspersed nuclear element- also known l1 element can retrotranspose neuronal precursors derived rat hippocampus neural stem cells resulting retrotransposition events can alter expression neuronal genes turn can influence neuronal cell fate vitro show retrotransposition human l1 transgenic mice results neuronal somatic mosaicism molecular mechanism action probably mediated sox2 decrease sox2 expression early stages neuronal differentiation correlated increases l1 transcription retrotransposition data therefore indicate neuronal genomes might static might mosaic de novo l1 retrotransposition events
