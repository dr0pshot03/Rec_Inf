oligocene mammals ethiopia faunal exchange afro-arabia eurasia
afro-arabian mammalian communities underwent marked transition near oligocene/miocene boundary approximately million years myr ago although well documented endemic paenungulate taxa replaced migrants northern hemisphere timing evolutionary dynamics transition long mystery faunas myr ago largely unknown report late oligocene fossil assemblage ethiopia constrains migration postdate myr ago yields new insight indigenous faunal dynamics preceded event fauna composed large paenungulate herbivores reveals earlier taxa persisted late oligocene epoch also demonstrates one group proboscidea underwent marked diversification eurasian immigrants entered afro-arabia pattern winners losers among endemics emerged: less diverse taxa arsinoitheres became extinct moderately species-rich groups hyracoids continued miocene reduced diversity whereas proboscideans successfully carried adaptive radiation afro-arabia across world
