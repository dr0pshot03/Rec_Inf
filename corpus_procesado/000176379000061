pseudomonas-candida interactions: ecological role virulence factors
bacterial-fungal interactions great environmental medical economic importance yet well characterized molecular level describe pathogenic interaction pseudomonas aeruginosa candida albicans two opportunistic pathogens p aeruginosa forms dense biofilm c albicans laments kills fungus contrast p aeruginosa neither binds kills yeast-form c albicans several p aeruginosa virulence factors important disease involved killing c albicans laments propose many virulence factors studied context human infection may also role bacterial-fungal interactions
