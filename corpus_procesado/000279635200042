predictive model wall-bounded turbulent flow
behavior turbulent fluid motion particularly thin chaotic fluid layers immediately adjacent solid boundaries can difficult understand predict layers account % aerodynamic drag modern airliners occupy first meters atmosphere thus governing wider meteorological phenomena physics layers important processes occur close solid boundary-the region accurate measurements simulations challenging propose mathematical model predict near-wall turbulence given large-scale information outer boundary layer region predictive capability may enable new strategies control turbulence may provide basis improved engineering weather prediction simulations
