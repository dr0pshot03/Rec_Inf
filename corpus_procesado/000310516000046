quantum entanglement high angular momenta 
single photons helical phase structures may carry quantized amount orbital angular momentum oam entanglement important quantum information science fundamental tests quantum theory theoretical upper limit many quanta oam single photon can carry possible create entanglement two particles arbitrarily high difference quantum number transferring polarization entanglement oam interferometric scheme generate verify entanglement two photons differing quantum number restrictive factors toward higher numbers current technical limitations also experimentally demonstrate entanglement high oam can improve sensitivity angular resolution remote sensing
