template boundary yeast telomerase specified rna structure 
telomerase ribonucleoprotein phylogenetically divergent rna subunit contains short template telomeric dna synthesis understand telomerase rna participates mechanistic aspects telomere synthesis studied conserved secondary structure adjacent template disruption structure caused dna synthesis proceed beyond normal template boundary resulting altered telomere sequences telomere shortening cellular growth defects compensatory mutations restored normal telomerase function thus rna structure rather sequence specifies template boundary study reveals specific function rna structure enzymatic action telomerase
