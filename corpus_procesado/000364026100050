biodiversity increases resistance ecosystem productivity climate extremes 
remains unclear whether biodiversity buffers ecosystems climate extremes becoming increasingly frequent worldwide early results suggested ecosystem productivity diverse grassland plant communities resistant changing less drought resilient recovering quickly drought depauperate communities however subsequent experimental tests produced mixed results- use data experiments manipulated grassland plant diversity test whether biodiversity provides resistance resilience climate events show biodiversity increased ecosystem resistance broad range climate events including wet dry moderate extreme brief prolonged events across studies climate events productivity low-diversity communities one two species changed approximately % climate events whereas high-diversity communities species resistant changing approximately % year climate event ecosystem productivity often fully recovered overshot normal levels productivity high-and low-diversity communities leading detectable dependence ecosystem resilience biodiversity results suggest biodiversity mainly stabilizes ecosystem productivity productivity-dependent ecosystem services increasing resistance climate events anthropogenic environmental changes drive biodiversity loss thus seem likely decrease ecosystem stability restoration biodiversity increase mainly changing resistance ecosystem productivity climate events
