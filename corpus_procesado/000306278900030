accurate whole-genome sequencing haplotyping human cells 
recent advances whole-genome sequencing brought vision personal genomics genomic medicine closer reality however current methods lack clinical accuracy ability describe context haplotypes genome variants co-occur cost-effective manner describe low-cost dna sequencing haplotyping process long fragment read lfr technology similar sequencing long single dna molecules without cloning separation metaphase chromosomes study ten lfr libraries made using similar picograms human dna per sample % heterozygous single nucleotide variants assembled long haplotype contigs removal false positive single nucleotide variants phased multiple lfr haplotypes resulted final genome error rate megabases cost-effective accurate genome sequencing haplotyping - human cells demonstrated will enable comprehensive genetic studies diverse clinical applications
