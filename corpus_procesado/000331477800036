fuel gain exceeding unity inertially confined fusion implosion
ignition needed make fusion energy viable alternative energy source yet achieved key step way ignition energy generated fusion reactions inertially confined fusion plasma exceed amount energy deposited deuterium-tritium fusion fuel hotspot implosion process resulting fuel gain greater unity report achievement fusion fuel gains exceeding unity us national ignition facility using high-foot implosion method manipulation laser pulse shape way reduces instability implosion experiments show order-of-magnitude improvement yield performance past deuterium-tritium implosion experiments also see significant contribution yield alpha-particle self-heating evidence bootstrapping required accelerate deuterium-tritium fusion burn eventually run away ignite
