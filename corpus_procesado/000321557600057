observation trapped light within radiation continuum
ability confine light important scientifically technologically many light confinement methods exist achieve confinement materials systems forbid outgoing waves systems can implemented metallic mirrors photonic band-gap materials highly disordered media anderson localization subset outgoing waves translational symmetry total internal reflection1 rotational reflection symmetry exceptions examples exist theoretical proposals- predict show experimentally light can perfectly confined patterned dielectric slab even though outgoing waves allowed surrounding medium technically observation embedded eigenvalue namely bound state continuum radiation modes-that due symmetry incompatibility-- bound state can exist stably general class geometries radiation amplitudes vanish simultaneously result destructive interference method trap electromagnetic waves also applicable electronic mechanical waves
