generating single microwave photons circuit
microwaves widespread use classical communication technologies long-distance broadcasts short-distance signals within computer chip like forms light microwaves even guided wires integrated circuit consist discrete photons enable quantum communication distant parts quantum computer signals must also quantum consisting single photons example however conventional sources can generate classical light single photons one way realize single-photon source collect fluorescence single atom early experiments measured quantum nature continuous radiation advances allowed triggered sources photons demand- allow efficient photon collection emitters typically placed inside optical microwave cavities- sources difficult employ quantum communication wires within integrated circuit demonstrate on-chip on-demand single-photon source microwave photons injected wire high efficiency spectral purity accomplished circuit quantum electrodynamics architecture microwave transmission line cavity enhances spontaneous emission single superconducting qubit qubit spontaneously emits generated photon acts flying qubit transmitting quantum information across chip perform tomography qubit emitted photons clearly showing quantum phase amplitude transferred emission average power voltage photon source characterized verify performance system single-photon source important addition rapidly growing toolbox quantum optics chip
