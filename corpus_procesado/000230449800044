kinesin klp2 mediates polarization interphase microtubules fission yeast 
fission yeast schizosaccharomyces pombe cells grow longitudinally manner dependent polarized distribution interphase microtubules found distribution required sliding microtubules toward cell center along preexisting microtubules sliding mediated minus end-directed kinesin motor klp2 helped microtubules become properly organized plus ends predominantly oriented toward cell ends minus ends toward cell center thus interphase microtubules fission yeast require motor activities proper organization
