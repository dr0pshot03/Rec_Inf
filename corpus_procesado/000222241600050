deficit attachment behavior mice lacking mu-opioid receptor gene 
endogenous opioid binding mu receptors hypothesized mediate natural rewards proposed basis infant attachment behavior report mu-opioid receptor knockout mouse pups emit fewer ultrasonic vocalizations removed mothers exposed cold male mice odors moreover knockout pups show preference toward mothers cues show ultrasonic calls potentiation brief maternal exposure results study may indicate molecular mechanism diseases characterized deficits attachment behavior autism reactive attachment disorder
