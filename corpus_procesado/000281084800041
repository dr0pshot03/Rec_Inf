cell lineage reconstruction early zebrafish embryos using label-free nonlinear microscopy 
quantifying cell behaviors animal early embryogenesis remains challenging issue requiring toto imaging automated image analysis designed framework imaging reconstructing unstained whole zebrafish embryos first cell division cycles report measurements along cell lineage micrometer spatial resolution minute temporal accuracy point-scanning multiphoton excitation optimized preferentially probe innermost regions embryo provided intrinsic signals highlighting mitotic spindles cell boundaries automated image analysis revealed phenomenology cell proliferation blastomeres continuously drift synchrony cell stage cell cycle lengthens according cell radial position leading apparent division waves progressive amplification process rule contrasting classical descriptions abrupt changes system dynamics
