two-electron dissociation single molecules atomic manipulation room temperature 
using tip scanning tunnelling microscope stm mechanically manipulate individual atoms molecules surface now well established procedure12 similarly selective vibrational excitation adsorbed molecules stm tip induce motion dissociation widely demonstrated34 experiments usually performed weakly bound atoms need stabilized operating cryogenic temperatures analogous experiments room temperature5 difficult require relatively strongly bound species perturbed random thermal fluctuations manipulation can still achieved electronic excitation atom molecule electron current6- tunnelling stm tip surface relatively high bias voltages1011 typically 5v use approach selectively dissociate chlorine atoms individual oriented chlorobenzene molecules adsorbed si x surface map final destination chlorine daughter atoms finding radial angular distributions depend tunnelling current hence excitation rate system one tunnelling electron nominally sufficient energy induce dissociation yet process requires two electrons explain observations two-electron mechanism couples vibrational excitation dissociative electron attachment steps
