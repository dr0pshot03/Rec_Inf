integrated map structural variation human genomes
structural variants implicated numerous diseases make majority varying nucleotides among human genomes describe integrated set eight structural variant classes comprising balanced unbalanced variants constructed using short-read dna sequencing data statistically phased onto haplotype blocks human populations analysing set identify numerous gene-intersecting structural variants exhibiting population stratification describe naturally occurring homozygous gene knockouts suggest dispensability variety human genes demonstrate structural variants enriched haplotypes identified genome-wide association studies exhibit enrichment expression quantitative trait loci additionally uncover appreciable levels structural variant complexity different scales including genic loci subject clusters repeated rearrangement complex structural variants multiple breakpoints likely formed individual mutational events catalogue will enhance future studies structural variant demography functional impact disease association
