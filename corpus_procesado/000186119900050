generating diverse skeletons small molecules combinatorially 
lack efficient access collections synthetic compounds skeletal diversity key bottleneck small-molecule discovery process report synthesis strategy involves transforming substrates different appendages pre-encode skeletal information named sigma elements products different skeletons use common reaction conditions approach split-pool synthesis can used pre-encode skeletal diversity combinatorially thereby generate small molecules efficiently split-pool synthesis compounds produced overlapping combinatorial matrices molecular skeletons appended building blocks enantiomeric diastereomeric forms
