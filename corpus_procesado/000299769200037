spin-down radio millisecond pulsars genesis 
millisecond pulsars old neutron stars spun high rotational frequencies via accretion mass binary companion star important issue understanding physics early spin evolution millisecond pulsars impact expanding magnetosphere terminal stages mass-transfer process report binary stellar evolution calculations show braking torque acting neutron star companion star decouples roche lobe able dissipate >% rotational energy pulsar effect may explain apparent difference observed spin distributions x-ray radio millisecond pulsars help account noticeable age discrepancy young white dwarf companions
