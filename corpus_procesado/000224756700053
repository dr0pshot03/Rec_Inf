silico genetics: identification functional element regulating h2-e alpha gene expression 
computational tools can markedly accelerate rate murine genetic models can analyzed developed computational method mapping phenotypic traits vary among inbred strains onto haplotypic blocks method correctly predicted genetic basis strain-specific differences several biologically important traits also used identify allele-specific functional genomic element regulating h2-ealpha gene expression functional element contained binding sites yy1 second transcription factor probably serum response factor located within first intron h2-ealpha gene computational method will greatly improve ability identify genetic basis variety phenotypic traits ranging qualitative trait information quantitative gene expression data vary among inbred mouse strains
