homothallic heterothallic mating opportunistic pathogen candida albicans 
candida albicans common fungal pathogen humans causing debilitating mucosal infections potentially life-threatening systemic infections recently c albicans thought strictly asexual existing obligate diploid cryptic mating cycle since uncovered diploid alpha cells undergo efficient cell nuclear fusion resulting tetraploid a/alpha mating products- whereas mating alpha cells established heterothallism report two pathways same-sex mating homothallism c albicans first unisexual populations cells found undergo autocrine pheromone signalling same-sex mating absence bar1 protease c albicans saccharomyces cerevisiae bar1 produced cells inactivates mating pheromone alpha typically secreted alpha cells- c albicans delta bar1 cells shown secrete alpha mating pheromones alpha-pheromone activated self-mating cells process dependent ste2 receptor alpha-pheromone addition pheromone production alpha cells found promote same-sex mating wild-type cells results establish homothallic mating can occur c albicans revealing potential genetic exchange even within unisexual populations organism furthermore bar1 protease unexpected pivotal role determining whether sexual reproduction can potentially homothallic exclusively heterothallic findings also implications mode sexual reproduction related species propagate unisexually indicate role specialized sexual cycles survival adaptation pathogenic fungi
