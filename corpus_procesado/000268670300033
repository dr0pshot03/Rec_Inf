high stellar velocity dispersion compact massive galaxy redshift z 
recent studies found oldest luminous galaxies early universe surprisingly compact- stellar masses similar present-day elliptical galaxies much smaller sizes finding attracted considerable attention- suggests massive galaxies grown size factor five past ten billion years gyr key test results determination stellar kinematics one compact galaxies: sizes objects extreme claimed stars expected much higher velocities present-day galaxies mass report measurement stellar velocity dispersion massive compact galaxy redshift z corresponding look-back time gyr velocity dispersion high -+ km s- consistent mass compactness galaxy inferred photometric data indicate significant recent structural dynamical evolution massive galaxies past gyr uncertainty dispersion determined simulations include effects noise template mismatch however exclude possibility subtle systematic effect may influenced analysis given low signal-to-noise ratio spectrum
