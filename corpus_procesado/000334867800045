chloroplast retrograde signal regulates nuclear alternative splicing
light source energy also regulator plant physiological adaptations show light/dark conditions affect alternative splicing subset arabidopsis genes preferentially encoding proteins involved rna processing effect requires functional chloroplasts also observed roots communication photosynthetic tissues interrupted suggesting signaling molecule travels plant using photosynthetic electron transfer inhibitors different mechanisms action deduce reduced pool plastoquinones initiates chloroplast retrograde signaling regulates nuclear alternative splicing necessary proper plant responses varying light conditions
