hypothalamic k-atp channels control hepatic glucose production
obesity driving force behind worldwide increase prevalence type diabetes mellitus hyperglycaemia hallmark diabetes largely due increased hepatic gluconeogenesis medial hypothalamus major integrator nutritional hormonal signals play pivotal roles regulation energy balance also modulation liver glucose output bidirectional changes hypothalamic insulin signalling therefore result parallel changes energy balance- glucose metabolism show activation atp-sensitive potassium k-atp channels mediobasal hypothalamus sufficient lower blood glucose levels inhibition hepatic gluconeogenesis finally infusion k-atp blocker within mediobasal hypothalamus surgical resection hepatic branch vagus nerve negates effects central insulin halves effects systemic insulin hepatic glucose production consistent results mice lacking sur1 subunit k-atp channel resistant inhibitory action insulin gluconeogenesis findings suggest activation hypothalamic k-atp channels normally restrains hepatic gluconeogenesis alteration within central nervous system/liver circuit can contribute diabetic hyperglycaemia
