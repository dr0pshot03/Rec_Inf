conserved role nanos proteins germ cell development 
drosophila maternally supplied nanos functions migration primordial germ cells pgcs gonad; mice zygotic genes involved instead report cloning functional analyses nanos2 nanos3 mice genes differentially expressed mouse pgcs nanos2 predominantly expressed male germ cells elimination gene results complete loss spermatogonia however nanos3 found migrating pgcs elimination factor results complete loss germ cells sexes hence although mice flies differ mechanisms germ cell specification seems conserved function nanos proteins among invertebrates vertebrates
