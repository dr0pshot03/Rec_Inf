neuronal activity-induced gadd45b promotes epigenetic dna demethylation adult neurogenesis
mammalian brain exhibits diverse types neural plasticity including activity dependent neurogenesis adult hippocampus transient activation mature neurons leads long-lasting modulation adult neurogenesis unknown identify gadd45b neural activity induced immediate early gene mature hippocampal neurons mice gadd45b deletion exhibit specific deficits neural activity induced proliferation neural progenitors dendritic growth newborn neurons adult hippocampus mechanistically gadd45b required activity induced dna demethylation specific promoters expression corresponding genes critical adult neurogenesis including brain derived neurotrophic factor fibroblast growth factor thus gadd45b links neuronal circuit activity epigenetic dna modification expression secreted factors mature neurons extrinsic modulation neurogenesis adult brain
