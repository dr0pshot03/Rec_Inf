large heterogeneities comet 67p revealed active pits sinkhole collapse 
pits observed many cometary nuclei mapped spacecraft- argued cometary pits signature endogenic activity rather impact craters planetary asteroid surfaces impact experiments andmodels reproduce shapes observed cometary pits predicted collision rates imply pits related impacts alternative mechanisms like explosive activity suggested driving process remains unknown report pits comet 67p/churyumov-gerasimenko active probably created sinkhole process possibly accompanied outbursts argue formation pits expand slowly diameter owing sublimation-driven retreat walls therefore pits characterize eroded surface is: fresh cometary surface will ragged structure many pits evolved surface will look smoother size spatial distribution pits imply large heterogeneities exist physical structural compositional properties first hundred metres current nucleus surface
