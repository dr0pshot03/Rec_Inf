liquid crystalline spinning spider silk 
spider silk outstanding mechanical properties despite spun close ambient temperatures pressures using water solvent spider achieves feat benign fibre processing judiciously controlling folding crystallization main protein constituents adding auxiliary compounds create composite material defined hierarchical structure spinning dope material silk spun liquid crystalline spiders can draw extrusion hardened fibre using minimal forces process involves unusual internal drawdown within spiders spinneret seen industrial fibre processing followed conventional external drawdown dope left spinneret successful copying spiders internal processing precise control protein folding combined knowledge gene sequences spinning dopes permit industrial production silk-based fibres unique properties benign conditions
