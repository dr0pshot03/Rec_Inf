anthropogenic seismicity rates operational parameters salton sea geothermal field
geothermal power growing energy source however efforts increase production tempered concern induced earthquakes although increased seismicity commonly accompanies geothermal production induced earthquake rate currently forecast basis fluid injection volumes operational parameters show salton sea geothermal field total volume fluid extracted injected tracks long-term evolution seismicity correcting aftershock rate net fluid volume extracted-injected provides best correlation seismicity recent years model background earthquake rate linear combination injection net production rates allows us track secular development field number earthquakes per fluid volume injected decreases time
