cb1 cannabinoid receptors on-demand defense excitotoxicity 
abnormally high spiking activity can damage neurons signaling systems protect neurons consequences abnormal discharge activity postulated generated conditional mutant mice lack expression cannabinoid receptor type principal forebrain neurons adjacent inhibitory interneurons mutant mice excitotoxin kainic acid ka induced excessive seizures vivo threshold ka-induced neuronal excitation vitro severely reduced hippocampal pyramidal neurons mutants ka administration rapidly raised hippocampal levels anandamide induced protective mechanisms wild-type principal hippocampal neurons protective mechanisms triggered mutant mice endogenous cannabinoid system thus provides on-demand protection acute excitotoxicity central nervous system neurons
