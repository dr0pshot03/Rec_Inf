effect acoustic clutter prey detection bats 
bats capture animal prey substrates often emit characteristic echolocation calls short-duration frequency-modulated fm broadband calls seem suited locating prey uncluttered habitats including flying prey may less effective finding prey among cluttered backgrounds echoes reflecting substrate mask acoustic signature prey- perhaps call designs serve primarily spatial orientation- furthermore unclear whether acoustic image conveyed fm echoes enables fine texture discrimination whether gleaning bats forage echo-cluttering environments must locate prey using cues prey-generated sounds-- show two species insectivorous gleaning bats perform badly compelled detect silent immobile prey clutter efficient capturing noisy prey items among highly cluttered backgrounds dead live prey uncluttered habitats findings suggest short broadband fm echolocation calls associated gleaning bats adapted detecting prey clutter
