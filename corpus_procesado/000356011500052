luminance-dependent visual processing enables moth flight low light 
animals must operate enormous range light intensities nocturnal twilight flying insects hypothesized compensate dim conditions integrating light longer times slowing visual processing increase light sensitivity also reduce movement response times using freely hovering moths tracking robotic moving flowers showed moths visual processing slow dim light longer response times consistent models visual neurons enhance sensitivity low light intensities pose challenge moths feeding swaying flowers dusk-foraging moths avoid sensorimotor tradeoff nervous systems slow much interfere ability track movements real wind-blown flowers
