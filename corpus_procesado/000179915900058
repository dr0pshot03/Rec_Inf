distinct signaling pathway used igg-containing b cell antigen receptor
immunoglobulin g igg-containing b lymphocyte antigen receptor igg-bcr transmits signal distinct igm-bcr igd-bcr although three use signal-transducing component igalpha/igbeta demonstrate inhibitory coreceptor cd22 down-modulates signaling igm-bcr igd-bcr igg-bcr igg cytoplasmic tail prevents cd22 phosphorylation results suggest cytoplasmic tail igg specifically enhances igg-bcr signaling preventing cd22-mediated signal inhibition enhanced signaling igg-bcr may involved efficient igg production crucial immunity pathogens
