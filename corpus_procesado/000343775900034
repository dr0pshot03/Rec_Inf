characterizing predicting magnetic environment leading solar eruptions 
physical mechanism responsible coronal mass ejections uncertain many years large part difficulty knowing three-dimensional magnetic field low corona two possible models emerged first twisted flux rope moves equilibrium becomes unstable subsequent reconnection powers ejection- second new flux rope forms result reconnection magnetic lines arcade group arches field lines eruption observational support mechanisms claimed- report modelling demonstrates twisted flux ropes lead ejection support first model seeing coronal mass ejection use observed photospheric magnetic field region four days earlier boundary condition determine magnetic field configuration field evolves slowly eruption can treated effectively static solution find fourth day flux rope forms grows increasing free energy solution becomes initial condition let model evolve dynamically conditions driven photospheric changes flux cancellation magnetic energy stored configuration high equilibrium possible flux rope squeezed upwards subsequent reconnection drives mass ejection
