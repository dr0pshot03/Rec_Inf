untangling aerosol effects clouds precipitation buffered system
thought changes concentration cloud-active aerosol can alter precipitation efficiency clouds thereby changing cloud amount hence radiative forcing climate system despite decades research proved frustratingly difficult establish climatically meaningful relationships among aerosol clouds precipitation result climatic effect aerosol remains controversial propose difficulty untangling relationships among aerosol clouds precipitation reflects inadequacy existing tools methodologies failure account processes buffer cloud precipitation responses aerosol perturbations
