paleogenomic perspective evolution gene function: new insights ancient dna
publication partial complete paleogenomes within last years reinvigorated research ancient dna longer limited short fragments mitochondrial dna inference evolutionary processes time can now investigated genome-wide data sampled far back years tremendous insights made particular regarding hominin lineage rare exception however paleogenomic perspective mired quality quantity recoverable dna though conceptually simple extracting ancient dna remains challenging sequencing ancient genomes high coverage remains prohibitively expensive laboratories still improvements dna isolation declining sequencing costs taxonomic geographic purview paleogenomics expanding rapid pace improved capacity screen large numbers samples high proportions endogenous ancient dna paleogenomics poised become key technology better understand recent evolutionary events
