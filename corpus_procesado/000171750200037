ion conduction pore conserved among potassium channels
potassium channels group specialized membrane proteins enable k+ ions flow selectively across cell membranes transmembrane k+ currents underlie electrical signalling neurons excitable cells atomic structure bacterial k+ channel pore solved means x-ray crystallography extent prokaryotic pore representative k+ channels landmark achievement profound implications general understanding k+ channels serious doubts raised concerning whether prokaryotic k+ channel pore actually represent eukaryotes addressed fundamental issue substituting prokaryotic pore eukaryotic voltage-gated inward-rectifier k+ channels resulting chimaeras retain respective functional hallmarks eukaryotic channels indicates ion conduction pore indeed conserved among k+ channels
