microphysical connection among biomass burning cumulus clouds stratospheric moisture
likely causal chain established connects humidity stratosphere relative humidity near tropical tropopause ice crystal size towering cumulus clouds aerosols associated tropical biomass burning connections revealed satellite-observed fluctuations quantity monthly yearly time scales aerosols lead smaller ice crystals water vapor entering stratosphere connections consistent physical reasoning probably hold longer time scales may help explain stratospheric water vapor appears increasing past five decades
