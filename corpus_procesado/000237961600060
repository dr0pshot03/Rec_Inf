outer membrane active transport: structure btub : tonb complex 
gram-negative bacteria import essential micronutrients across outer membrane requires transporter electrochemical gradient protons across inner membrane inner membrane protein complex exbb exbd tonb couples proton-motive force outer membrane transporter inner membrane protein tonb binds directly conserved region called ton-box transporter solved structure cobalamin transporter btub complex c-terminal domain tonb contrast conformations absence tonb ton-box forms beta strand recruited existing b sheet tonb consistent mechanical pulling model transport
