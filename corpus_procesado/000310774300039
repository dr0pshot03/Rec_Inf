non-invasive imaging opaque scattering layers 
non-invasive optical imaging techniques optical coherence tomography1- essential diagnostic tools many disciplines life sciences nanotechnology however present methods able image opaque layers scatter incident light45 even thin layer scattering material can appear opaque hide objects behind it6 although great progress made recently methods ghost imaging78 wavefront shaping9- present procedures still invasive require either detector12 nonlinear material13 placed behind scattering layer report optical method allows non-invasive imaging fluorescent object completely hidden behind opaque scattering layer illuminate object laser light passed scattering layer scan angle incidence laser beam detect total fluorescence object front detected signal obtain image hidden object using iterative algorithm1415 proof concept retrieve detailed image fluorescent object comparable size micrometres typical human cell hidden millimetres behind opaque optical diffuser image complex biological sample enclosed two opaque screens approach non-invasive imaging strongly scattering media can generalized contrast mechanisms geometries
