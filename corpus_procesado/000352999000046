asymmetric apportioning aged mitochondria daughter cells required stemness 
dividing asymmetrically stem cells can generate two daughter cells distinct fates however evidence limited mammalian systems selective apportioning subcellular contents daughters followed fates old young organelles division human mammary stemlike cells found cells apportion aged mitochondria asymmetrically daughter cells daughter cells received fewer old mitochondria maintained stem cell traits inhibition mitochondrial fission disrupted age-dependent subcellular localization segregation mitochondria caused loss stem cell properties progeny cells hence mechanisms exist mammalian stemlike cells asymmetrically sort aged young mitochondria important maintaining stemness properties
