perceptual basis bimanual coordination
periodic bimanual movements often focus studies basic organizational principles human actions- movements typical spontaneous tendency towards mirror symmetry even involuntary slips asymmetrical movement patterns symmetry occur vice versa traditionally phenomenon interpreted tendency towards co-activation homologous muscles probably originating motoric neuronal structures provide evidence contrary widespread assumption show two prominent experimental models-bimanual finger oscillation bimanual four-finger tapping-that symmetry bias actually towards spatial perceptual symmetry without regard muscles involved suggest spontaneous coordination phenomena kind purely perceptual nature case bimanual circling model findings reveal highly complex even impossible movements can easily performed simple visual feedback motoric representation performed perceptual oscillation patterns necessary thus need translate motoric perceptual representation vice versa using internal models ref suggest voluntary movements organized way representation perceptual goals whereas corresponding motor activity sometimes high complexity spontaneously flexibly tuned
