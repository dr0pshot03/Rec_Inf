jnk phosphorylates paxillin regulates cell migration 
c-jun amino-terminal kinase jnk generally thought involved inflammation proliferation apoptosis accordingly substrates transcription factors antiapoptotic proteins however jnk also shown required drosophila dorsal closure map kinase/erk kinase kinase upstream kinase jnk pathway shown essential cell migration results imply jnk important cell migration show jnk1 required rapid movement fish keratocytes rat bladder tumour epithelial cells nbt-ii moreover jnk1 phosphorylates serine paxillin focal adhesion adaptor vitro intact cells nbt-ii cells expressing ser -> ala mutant paxillin paxs178a formed focal adhesions exhibited limited movement associated contacts single-cell-migration wound-healing assays contrast cells expressing wild-type paxillin moved rapidly retained close contacts predominant adhesion expression paxs178a also inhibited migration two cell lines thus phosphorylation paxillin jnk seems essential maintaining labile adhesions required rapid cell migration
