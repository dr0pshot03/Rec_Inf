drosophila netrin receptor frazzled guides axons controlling netrin distribution 
netrin secreted protein can act chemotropic axon guidance cue two classes netrin receptor dcc3 unc refs required axon guidance- thought mediate netrin signals growth cones cytoplasmic domains however guidance drosophila photoreceptor axons dcc orthologue frazzled required photoreceptor neurons instead targets indicating frazzled also non-cell-autonomous function show frazzled can capture netrin present recognition receptors moreover frazzled actively localized within axon cytoplasmic domain thereby rearranges netrin protein spatial pattern completely different pattern netrin gene expression frazzled-dependent guidance one pioneer neuron central nervous system can accounted solely basis ability frazzled control netrin distribution frazzled signalling propose model patterning mechanism receptor rearranges secreted ligand molecules thereby creating positional information receptors
