dislocations complex materials 
deformation metals alloys dislocations gliding well-separated slip planes well-understood process crystal structures possess simple geometric arrangements examples laves phases common class intermetallic compounds exist ordered cubic hexagonal rhombohedral structures compounds usually brittle low temperatures transformation one structure another slow basis geometric energetic considerations dislocation-based mechanism consisting two shears different directions adjacent atomic planes used explain deformation phase transformations class materials report direct observations made z-contrast atomic resolution microscopy stacking faults dislocation cores laves phase cr2hf results show complex dislocation scheme indeed operate material knowledge gained dislocation core structure will enable improved understanding deformation mechanisms andphase transformation kinetics complex structures
