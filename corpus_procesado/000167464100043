electrical spin injection accumulation room temperature all-metal mesoscopic spin valve 
finding means generate control use spin-polarized currents represents important challenge spin-based electronics- spintronics spin currents associated phenomenon spin accumulation can realized driving current ferromagnetic electrode non-magnetic metal semiconductor first demonstrated years ago spin injection experiment single crystal aluminium bar temperatures k recent experiments- demonstrated successful optical detection spin injection semiconductors using either optical injection circularly polarized light electrical injection magnetic semiconductor however possible achieve fully electrical spin injection detection room temperature report room-temperature electrical injection detection spin currents observe spin accumulation all-metal lateral mesoscopic spin valve ferromagnetic electrodes used drive spin-polarized current crossed copper strips anticipate larger signals obtainable optimizing choice materials device geometry
