circumstellar disk associated massive protostellar object
formation process stars masses several times sun still unclear two main theories mergers several low-mass young stellar objects requires high stellar density mass accretion circumstellar disks way low-mass stars formed accompanied outflows process gravitational infall although number disks discovered around low intermediate-mass young stellar objects presence disks around massive young stellar objects still uncertain mass disk system detected around one object m17 disputed report near-infrared imaging polarimetry reveals outflow/ disk system around becklin neugebauer protostellar object mass least seven solar masses m- strongly supports theory stars masses least 7m form way lower mass stars
