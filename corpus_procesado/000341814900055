supermassive black hole ultra-compact dwarf galaxy
ultra-compact dwarf galaxies among densest stellar systems universe systems masses x solar masses half-light radii just parsecs dynamicalmass estimates show many dwarfs massive expected luminosity remains unclear whether high dynamical mass estimates arise presence supermassive black holes result non-standard stellar initial mass function causes average stellar mass higher expected report adaptive optics kinematic data ultra-compact dwarf galaxy m60-ucd1 show central velocity dispersion peak exceeding kilometres per second modest rotation dynamical modelling data reveals presence supermassive black hole amass x solarmasses per cent objects total mass high black hole mass mass fraction suggest m60-ucd1 stripped nucleus galaxy analysis also shows m60-ucd1s stellar mass consistent luminosity implying large population previously unrecognized supermassive black holes ultra-compact dwarf galaxies
