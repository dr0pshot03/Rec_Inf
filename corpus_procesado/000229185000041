micrometre-scale silicon electro-optic modulator
metal interconnections expected become limiting factor performance electronic systems transistors continue shrink size replacing optical interconnections different levels ranging rack-to-rack chip-to-chip intra-chip interconnections provide low power dissipation low latencies high bandwidths needed- implementation optical interconnections relies development micro-optical devices integrated microelectronics chips recent demonstrations silicon low-loss waveguides- light emitters amplifiers- lasers approach goal small silicon electro-optic modulator size small enough chip-scale integration yet demonstrated experimentally demonstrate high-speed electro-optical modulator compact silicon structures modulator based resonant light-confining structure enhances sensitivity light small changes refractive index silicon also enables high-speed operation modulator micrometres diameter three orders magnitude smaller previously demonstrated electro-optic modulators one critical components optoelectronic integration decreasing size may enable novel chip architectures
