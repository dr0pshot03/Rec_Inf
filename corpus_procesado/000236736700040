independent evolution bitter-taste sensitivity humans chimpanzees 
reported years ago chimpanzees like humans vary taste sensitivity bitter compound phenylthiocarbamide ptc suggested result shared balanced polymorphism defining first now classic example effects balancing selection great apes humans variable ptc sensitivity largely controlled segregation two common alleles tas2r38 locus encode receptor variants different ligand affinities- show ptc taste sensitivity chimpanzees also controlled two common alleles tas2r38 however neither alleles shared humans instead mutation initiation codon results use alternative downstream start codon production truncated receptor variant fails respond ptc vitro association testing ptc sensitivity cohort captive chimpanzees confirmed chimpanzee tas2r38 genotype accurately predicts taster status vivo therefore although fisher et als observations accurate explanation wrong humans chimpanzees share variable taste sensitivity bitter compounds mediated ptc receptor variants molecular basis variation arisen twice independently two species
