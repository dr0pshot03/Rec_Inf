coherent quantum phase slip
hundred years discovery superconductivity one fundamental prediction theory coherent quantum phase slip cqps observed cqps phenomenon exactly dual josephson effect whereas latter coherent transfer charges superconducting leads former coherent transfer vortices fluxes across superconducting wire contrast previously reported observations- incoherent phase slip cqps subject theoretical study- experimental demonstration made difficult quasiparticle dissipation due gapless excitations nanowires vortex cores difficulty might overcome using certain strongly disordered superconductors near superconductor-insulator transition report direct observation cqps narrow segment superconducting loop made strongly disordered indium oxide effect made manifest superposition quantum states different numbers flux quanta josephson effect observation lead new applications superconducting electronics quantum metrology
