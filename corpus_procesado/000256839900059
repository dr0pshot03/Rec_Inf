synergistic response oncogenic mutations defines gene class critical cancer phenotype 
understanding molecular underpinnings cancer critical importance development targeted intervention strategies identification targets however notoriously difficult unpredictable malignant cell transformation requires cooperation oncogenic mutations cause substantial reorganization many cell features induce complex changes gene expression patterns- genes critical multifaceted cellular phenotype therefore identified signalling pathway analysis- ad hoc basis- observations cell transformation cooperating oncogenic lesions depends synergistic modulation downstream signalling circuitry- suggest malignant transformation highly cooperative process involving synergy multiple levels regulation including gene expression show large proportion genes controlled synergistically loss-of-function p53 ras activation critical malignant state murine human colon cells notably cooperation response genes found contribute tumour formation gene perturbation experiments contrast perturbations genes responding non-synergistic manner similar effect synergistic control gene expression oncogenic mutations thus emerges underlying key malignancy provides attractive rationale identifying intervention targets gene networks downstream oncogenic gain loss-of-function mutations
