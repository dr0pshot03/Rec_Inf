carbon dioxide release north pacific abyss last deglaciation
atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations significantly lower glacial periods intervening interglacial periods mechanisms responsible difference remain uncertain many recent explanations call greater carbon storage poorly ventilated deep ocean glacial periods- direct evidence regarding ventilation respired carbon content glacial deep ocean sparse often equivocal present sedimentary geochemical records sites spanning deep subarctic pacific that-together previously published results-show poorly ventilated water mass containing high concentration respired carbon dioxide occupied north pacific abyss last glacial maximum despite inferred increase deep southern ocean ventilation first step deglaciation - years ago find evidence improved ventilation abyssal subarctic pacific rapid transition similar years ago: change accompanied acceleration export production surface waters small increase atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration speculate changes mechanistically linked roughly coeval increase deep water formation north atlantic- flushed respired carbon dioxide northern abyssal waters also increased supply nutrients upper ocean leading greater carbon dioxide sequestration mid-depths stalling rise atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations findings qualitatively consistent hypotheses invoking deglacial flushing respired carbon dioxide isolated deep ocean reservoir- suggest reservoir may released stages vigorous deep water ventilation switched north atlantic southern ocean source regions
