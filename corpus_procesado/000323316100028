observational correlation stellar brightness variations surface gravity
surface gravity basic stellar property difficult measure accurately typical uncertainties per cent measured spectroscopically per cent measured photometrically asteroseismology measures gravity uncertainty per cent restricted relatively small samples bright stars giants- availability high-precision measurements brightness variations stars provides opportunity investigate whether variations can used determine surface gravities fourier power granulation stars surface correlates physically surface gravity: brightness variations timescales hours arise granulation variations correlate surface gravity report analysis archival data reveals observational correlation surface gravity root mean squared brightness variations timescales less eight hours stars temperatures kelvin log surface gravities cgs units overall brightness variations less three parts per thousand straightforward observation optical brightness variations therefore allows determination surface gravity precision better per cent inactive sun-like stars main-sequence giant stages evolution
