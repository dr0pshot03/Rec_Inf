nanobelts semiconducting oxides 
ultralong beltlike ribbonlike nanostructures so-called nanobelts successfully synthesized semiconducting oxides zinc tin indium cadmium gallium simply evaporating desired commercial metal oxide powders high temperatures as-synthesized oxide nanobelts pure structurally uniform single crystalline free defects dislocations rectanglelike cross section typical widths nanometers width-to-thickness ratios lengths millimeters beltlike morphology appears distinctive common structural characteristic family semiconducting oxides cations different valence states materials distinct crystallographic structures nanobelts ideal system fully understanding dimensionally confined transport phenomena functional oxides building functional devices along individual nanobelts
