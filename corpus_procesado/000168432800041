size-dependent control binding biotinylated proteins streptavidin using polymer shield
many medical biotechnological processes rely controlling manipulating molecular-recognition capabilities proteins- can achieved using small molecules capable competing protein binding changing environmental parameters affect protein structure hence binding alternative provided stimuli-responsive polymers change reversibly water-soluble expanded coil water-insoluble collapsed globule upon small changes temperature ph light intensity: attached proteins vicinity binding sites reversibly block release small ligands- show approach can extended achieve size-selective binding large macromolecular ligands use thermally responsive polymer polynn-diethylacrylamide pdeaam attach protein streptavidin approximately angstrom binding site biotinylated proteins lower critical solution temperature pdeaam polymer extended state acts shield block binding large biotinylated proteins temperature collapses exposes binding site thereby allowing binding rnd degree shielding depends size biotinylated protein size pdeaam suggesting smart polymer shields tailored achieve wide range size-dependent ligand discrimination use affinity separations biosensors diagnostics technologies
