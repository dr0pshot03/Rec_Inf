wnt stabilization beta-catenin reveals principles morphogen receptor-scaffold assemblies 
wnt signaling stabilizes beta-catenin lrp6 receptor signaling complex antagonizes beta-catenin destruction complex axin scaffold associated glycogen synthase kinase gsk3 central roles assemblies transduction mechanism receptor destruction complex contentious report wnt signaling governed phosphorylation regulation axin scaffolding function phosphorylation gsk3 kept axin activated open beta-catenin interaction poised engagement lrp6 formation wnt-induced lrp6-axin signaling complex promoted axin dephosphorylation protein phosphatase inactivated closed axin intramolecular interaction inactivation axin diminished association beta-catenin lrp6 thereby inhibiting beta-catenin phosphorylation enabling activated lrp6 selectively recruit active axin inactivation reiteratively findings reveal mechanisms scaffold regulation morphogen signaling
