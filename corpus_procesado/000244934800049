cytochrome c oxidase model catalyzes oxygen water reduction rate-limiting electron flux 
studied selectivity functional model cytochrome c oxidases active site mimics coordination environment relative locations fea3 cub tyr control electron flux covalently attached model analogs lacking copper phenol onto self-assembled monolayer-coated gold electrodes electron transfer rate made rate limiting copper phenol required enhance selective reduction oxygen water finding supports hypothesis steady-state turnover primary role redox centers rapidly provide electrons needed reduce oxygen four electrons thus preventing release toxic partially reduced oxygen species
