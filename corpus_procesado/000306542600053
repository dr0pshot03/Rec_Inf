diversity interaction types ecological community stability 
ecological theory predicts complex community formed number species inherently unstable guiding ecologists identify maintains species diversity nature earlier studies often assumed community one interaction type either antagonistic competitive mutualistic interaction leaving open question diversity interaction types contributes community maintenance show theoretically multiple interaction types might hold key understanding community dynamics moderate mixture antagonistic mutualistic interactions can stabilize population dynamics furthermore increasing complexity leads increased stability "hybrid" community hypothesize diversity species interaction types may essential element biodiversity maintains ecological communities
