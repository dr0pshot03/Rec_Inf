vaccine strategy protects genital herpes establishing local memory t cells 
successful existing vaccines rely neutralizing antibodies may require specific anatomical localization b cells however efficacious vaccines rely t cells protection difficult develop robust systemic memory t-cell responses necessarily correlate host protection peripheral sites tissue-resident memory t cells provide superior protection compared circulating memory t cells describe simple non-inflammatory vaccine strategy enables establishment protective memory t-cell pool within peripheral tissue female genital tract portal entry sexually transmitted infections immunologically restrictive tissue prevents entry activated t cells absence inflammation infection overcome obstacle developed vaccine strategy term prime pull establish local tissue-resident memory t cells site potential viral exposure approach relies two steps: conventional parenteral vaccination elicit systemic t-cell responses prime followed recruitment activated t cells means topical chemokine application restrictive genital tract pull t cells establish long-term niche mediate protective immunity mice prime pull protocol reduces spread infectious herpes simplex virus sensory neurons prevents development clinical disease results reveal promising vaccination strategy herpes simplex virus potentially sexually transmitted infections human immunodeficiency virus
