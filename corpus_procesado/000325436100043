crystal structure na+-bound na+k+-atpase preceding e1p state
na+k+-atpase pumps three na+ ions cells exchange two k+ taken extracellular medium per atp molecule hydrolysed thereby establishing na+ k+ gradients across membrane animal cells ion gradients used many fundamental processes notably excitation nerve cells describe angstrom-resolution crystal structures atpase pig kidney bound na+ adp aluminium fluoride stable phosphate analogue without oligomycin promotes na+ occlusion crystal structures represent transition state preceding phosphorylated intermediate e1p three na+ ions occluded details na+-binding sites show atpase functions na+-specific pump rejecting k+ ca2+ even though affinity na+ low millimolar dissociation constant mechanism sequential cooperative na+ binding can now formulated atomic detail
