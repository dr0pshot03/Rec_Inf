fine-scale chimpanzee genetic map population sequencing
study evolution recombination rates apes developed methodology construct fine-scale genetic map high-throughput sequence data western chimpanzees pan troglodytes verus compared human genetic map broad-scale recombination rates tend conserved exceptions particularly regions chromosomal rearrangements around site ancestral fusion human chromosome fine scales chimpanzee recombination dominated hotspots show overlap humans even though rates similarly elevated around cpg islands decreased within genes hotspot-specifying protein prdm9 shows extensive variation among western chimpanzees little evidence sequence motifs enriched hotspots contrasting locations hotspots provide natural experiment demonstrates impact recombination base composition
