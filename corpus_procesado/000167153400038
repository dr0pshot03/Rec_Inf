automated solid-phase synthesis oligosaccharides
traditionally access structurally defined complex carbohydrates laborious although recent advancements solid-phase synthesis made construction complex oligosaccharides less tedious high level technical expertise still necessary obtain desired structures describe automated chemical synthesis several oligosaccharides solid-phase synthesizer branched dodecasaccharide synthesized use glycosyl phosphate building blocks octenediol functionalized resin target oligosaccharide readily obtained cleavage solid support access certain complex oligosaccharides now become feasible ina fashion much like construction oligopeptides oligonucleotides
