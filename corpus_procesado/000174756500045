bone marrow cells adopt phenotype cells spontaneous cell fusion 
recent studies demonstrated transplanted bone marrow cells can turn unexpected lineages including myocytes hepatocytes neurons many others1 potential problem however reports discussing transdifferentiation vivo tend conclude donor origin transdifferentiated cells basis existence donor-specific genes y-chromosome markers1 demonstrate mouse bone marrow cells can fuse spontaneously embryonic stem cells culture vitro contains interleukin- moreover spontaneously fused bone marrow cells can subsequently adopt phenotype recipient cells without detailed genetic analysis might interpreted dedifferentiation transdifferentiation
