material electrically tunable strength flow stress
selection structural material requires compromise strength ductility material properties will set choice alloy composition microstructure synthesis processing although requirements may change service life materials design strategies allow recoverable tuning mechanical properties thus desirable either response external control signals form spontaneous adaptation instance self-healing designed material hybrid nanostructure consisting strong metal backbone interpenetrated electrolyte second component polarizing internal interface via applied electric potential accomplish fast repeatable tuning yield strength flow stress ductility concept allows user select instance soft ductile state processing high-strength state service structural material
