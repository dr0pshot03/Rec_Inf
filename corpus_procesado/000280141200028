start/stop signals emerge nigrostriatal circuits sequence learning 
learning new action sequences subserves plethora different abilities escaping predator playing piano producing fluent speech proper initiation termination action sequence critical organization behaviour compromised nigrostriatal disorders like parkinsons huntingtons diseases using self-paced operant task mice learn perform particular sequence actions obtain outcome found neural activity nigrostriatal circuits specifically signalling initiation termination action sequence start/stop activity emerged sequence learning specific particular actions reflect interval timing movement speed action value furthermore genetically altering function striatal circuits disrupted development start/stop activity selectively impaired sequence learning results important implications understanding functional organization actions sequence initiation termination impairments observed basal ganglia disorders
