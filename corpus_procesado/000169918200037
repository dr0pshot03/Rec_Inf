plasma cell differentiation requires transcription factor xbp- 
considerable progress made identifying transcription factors involved early specification b-lymphocyte lineage however little known factors control transition mature activated b cells antibody-secreting plasma cells report transcription factor xbp- required generation plasma cells xbp- transcripts rapidly upregulated vitro stimuli induce plasma-cell differentiation found high levels plasma cells rheumatoid synovium introduced b-lineage cells xbp- initiated plasma-cell differentiation mouse lymphoid chimaeras deficient xbp- possessed normal numbers activated b lymphocytes proliferated secreted cytokines formed normal germinal centres however secreted little immunoglobulin isotype failed control infection b-cell-dependent polyoma virus plasma cells markedly absent xbp- transcription factor known selectively specifically required terminal differentiation b lymphocytes plasma cells
