two populations x-ray pulsars produced two types supernova
two types supernova thought produce overwhelming majority neutron stars universe first type iron-core-collapse supernovae occurs high-mass star develops degenerate iron core exceeds chandrasekhar limit second type electron-capture supernovae associated collapse lower-mass oxygen-neon-magnesium core loses pressure support owing sudden capture electrons neon and/or magnesium nuclei hitherto impossible identify two distinct families neutron stars produced formation channels report large well-known class neutron-star-hosting x-ray pulsars actually composed two distinct subpopulations different characteristic spin periods orbital periods orbital eccentricities class be/x-ray binaries contains neutron stars accrete material massive companion star two subpopulations probably associated two distinct types neutron-star-forming supernova electron-capture supernovae preferentially producing systems short spin periods short orbital periods low eccentricities intriguingly split two subpopulations clearest distribution logarithm spin period result predicted still remains explained
