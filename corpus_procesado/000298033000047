microwave amplification nanomechanical resonators 
sensitive measurement electrical signals heart modern technology according principles quantum mechanics detector amplifier necessarily adds certain amount noise signal equal least noise added quantum fluctuations12 quantum limit added noise nearly reached superconducting devices take advantage nonlinearities josephson junctions34 introduce concept amplification microwave signals using mechanical oscillation seems likely enable quantum-limited operation drive nanomechanical resonator radiation pressure force5- provide experimental demonstration analytical description signal input microwave cavity induces coherent stimulated emission consequently signal amplification generic scheme based two linear oscillators advantage conceptually practically simpler josephson junction devices device achieve signal amplification decibels addition quanta noise consistent expected amount added noise generality model allows realization physical systems well anticipate near-quantum-limited mechanical microwave amplification will soon feasible various applications involving integrated electrical circuits
