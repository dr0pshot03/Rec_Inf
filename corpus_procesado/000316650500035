circular rnas large class animal rnas regulatory potency 
circular rnas circrnas animals enigmatic class rna unknown function explore circrnas systematically sequenced computationally analysed human mouse nematode rna detected thousands well-expressed stable circrnas often showing tissue/developmental-stage-specific expression sequence analysis indicated important regulatory functions circrnas found human circrna antisense cerebellar degeneration-related protein transcript cdr1as densely bound microrna mirna effector complexes harbours conserved binding sites ancient mirna mir- analyses indicated cdr1as functions bind mir- neuronal tissues human cdr1as expression zebrafish impaired midbrain development similar knocking mir- suggesting cdr1as mirna antagonist mirna-binding capacity ten times higher known transcript together data provide evidence circrnas form large class post-transcriptional regulators numerous circrnas form head-to-tail splicing exons suggesting previously unrecognized regulatory potential coding sequences
