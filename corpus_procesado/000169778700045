discovery satellites saturn exhibiting orbital clustering
giant planets solar system two groups satellites regular satellites move along nearly circular orbits planets orbital plane revolving sense planet spins contrast so-called irregular satellites generally smaller size characterized large orbits significant eccentricity inclination differences characteristics suggest regular irregular satellites formed different mechanisms: regular satellites believed formed accretion disk around planet like miniature solar system whereas irregulars generally thought captured planetesimals report discovery irregular satellites saturn along determinations orbits orbits along orbits irregular satellites jupiter uranus fall groups basis orbital inclinations interpret result indicating irregular moons collisional remnants larger satellites fragmented capture rather captured independently
