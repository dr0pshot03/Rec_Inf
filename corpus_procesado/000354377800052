strangulation primary mechanism shutting star formation galaxies 
local galaxies broadly divided two main classes star-forming gas-rich quiescent passive gas-poor primary mechanism responsible quenching star formation galaxies transforming quiescent passive systems still unclear sudden removal gas outflows1- stripping7- one mechanisms often proposed alternative mechanism so-called "strangulation10- supply cold gas galaxy halted report analysis stellar metallicity fraction elements heavier helium stellar atmospheres local galaxies spectra clearly reveals strangulation primary mechanism responsible quenching star formation typical timescale four billion years least local galaxies stellar mass less solar masses result supported independently stellar age difference quiescent star-forming galaxies indicates quiescent galaxies less solar masses average observed four billion years quenching due strangulation
