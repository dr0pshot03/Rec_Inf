composite multiple signals distinguishes causal variants regions positive selection 
human genome contains hundreds regions whose patterns genetic variation indicate recent positive natural selection yet underlying gene advantageous mutation remain unknown developed method composite multiple signals cms combines tests multiple signals selection increases resolution -fold applying cms candidate regions international haplotype map localized population-specific selective signals kilobases median identifying known novel causal variants cms can just identify individual loci implicates precise variants selected evolution
