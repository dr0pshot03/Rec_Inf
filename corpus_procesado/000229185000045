sustained firing auditory cortex evoked preferred stimuli
well documented neurons auditory cortex anaesthetized animals generally display transient responses acoustic stimulation typically respond brief stimulus one fewer action potentials- number action potentials evoked stimulus usually increase increasing stimulus duration- observations long puzzled researchers across disciplines raised serious questions regarding role auditory cortex encoding ongoing acoustic signals contrary long-held views show single neurons primary area a1 lateral belt areas auditory cortex awake marmoset monkeys callithrix jacchus capable firing sustained manner prolonged period time especially driven preferred stimuli contrast responses become transient phasic auditory cortex neurons respond non-preferred stimuli findings suggest auditory cortex stimulated sound particular population neurons fire maximally throughout duration sound responses less optimally driven neurons fade away quickly stimulus onset results selective representation sound across neuronal population time
