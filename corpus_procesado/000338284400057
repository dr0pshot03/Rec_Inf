de novo formation distinct coronary vascular population neonatal heart
postnatal coronary vessels viewed developing expansion vessels formed fetal period using genetic lineage tracing found substantial portion postnatal coronary vessels arise de novo neonatal mouse heart rather expanding preexisting embryonic vasculature data show lineage conversion neonatal endocardial cells trabecular compaction generates distinct compartment coronary circulation located within inner half ventricular wall lineage conversion occurs within brief period birth provides efficient means rapidly augmenting coronary vasculature mechanism postnatal coronary vascular growth provides avenues understanding stimulating cardiovascular regeneration following injury disease
