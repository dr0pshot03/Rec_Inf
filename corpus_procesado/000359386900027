rejuvenation metallic glasses non-affine thermal strain
spatially uniform temperature change imposed solid one phase polycrystal single non-cubic phase showing anisotropic expansion-contraction resulting thermal strain inhomogeneous non-affine thermal cycling induces internal stresses leading structural property changes usually deleterious glasses solids form cooling liquid crystallization avoided-they might considered ultimate uniform solids without microstructural features defects associated polycrystals explore effects cryogenic thermal cycling glasses specifically metallic glasses show contrary null effect expected uniformity thermal cycling induces rejuvenation reaching less relaxed states higher energy interpret findings context dynamics liquids become heterogeneous cooling towards glass transition may consequent heterogeneities resulting glasses example vibrational dynamics glassy silica long wavelengths elastic continuum wavelengths less approximately three nanometres vibrational dynamics similar polycrystal anisotropic grains thermal cycling metallic glasses easily applied gives improvements compressive plasticity fact effects can achieved attributed intrinsic non-uniformity glass structure giving non-uniform coefficient thermal expansion metallic glasses may particularly suitable thermal cycling non-affine nature strains glasses general deserves study whether induced applied stresses temperature change
