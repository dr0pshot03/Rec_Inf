organization mitotic chromosome
mitotic chromosomes among recognizable structures cell yet century internal organization remains largely unsolved applied chromosome conformation capture methods 5c hi-c across cell cycle revealed two distinct three-dimensional folding states human genome show highly compartmentalized cell type-specific organization described previously nonsynchronous cells restricted interphase metaphase identified homogenous folding state locus-independent common chromosomes consistent among cell types suggesting general principle metaphase chromosome organization using polymer simulations found metaphase hi-c data inconsistent classic hierarchical models instead best described linearly organized longitudinally compressed array consecutive chromatin loops
