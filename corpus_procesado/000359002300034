zeolite family expanding structural complexity embedded isoreticular structures 
prediction synthesis new crystal structures enable targeted preparation materials desired properties among porous solids achieved metal-organic frameworks- widely applicable zeolites new materials usually discovered using exploratory synthesis although millions hypothetical zeolite structures proposed enough known synthesis mechanism allow given structure prepared present approach combines structure solution structure prediction inspires targeted synthesis new super-complex zeolites used electron diffraction identify family related structures discover structural coding within allowed us determine complex previously unknown structure zeolite zsm ref largest unit-cell volume known zeolites cubic angstroms demonstrates selective co2 adsorption extending method able predict members family increasingly complex structurally related zeolites synthesize two more-complex zeolites family pst pst- much larger cell volumes cubic angstroms respectively similar selective adsorption properties members family symmetry expanding unit cell related hitherto unrecognized structural principles call family members embedded isoreticular zeolite structures
