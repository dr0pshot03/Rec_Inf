asymmetric autocatalysis triggered carbon isotope c-/c- chirality
many apparently achiral organic molecules earth may chiral random substitution % naturally abundant c c enantiotopic moiety within structure however chirality source experimentally difficult discern small difference c c- demonstrated small difference can amplified easily seen experimental outcome using asymmetric autocatalysis reaction pyrimidine--carbaldehyde diisopropylzinc addition chiral molecules large enantiomeric excess however chiral virtue isotope substitution causes slight enantiomeric excess zinc alkoxide produced pyrimidyl alkanol asymmetric autocatalysis leads pyrimidyl alcohol large enantiomeric excess sense enantiomeric excess product alcohol varies consistently sense excess enantiomer carbon isotopically chiral compound
