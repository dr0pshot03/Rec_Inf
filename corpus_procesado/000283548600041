two-solar-mass neutron star measured using shapiro delay 
neutron stars composed densest form matter known exist universe composition properties still theoretically uncertain measurements masses radii objects can strongly constrain neutron star matter equation state rule theoretical models composition observed range neutron star masses however hitherto narrow rule many predictions exotic non-nucleonic components- shapiro delay general-relativistic increase light travel time curved space-time near massive body highly inclined nearly edge-on binary millisecond radio pulsar systems effect allows us infer masses neutron star binary companion high precision present radio timing observations binary millisecond pulsar j1614- show strong shapiro delay signature calculate pulsar mass +/ mcircle dot rules almost currently proposed- hyperon boson condensate equations state mcircle dot solar mass quark matter can support star massive quarks strongly interacting therefore free quarks
