role sea spray cleansing air pollution ocean via cloud processes 
particulate air pollution shown strongly suppress precipitation convective clouds land new observations show precipitation similar polluted clouds oceans much less affected large sea salt nuclei override precipitation suppression effect large number small pollution nuclei raindrops initiated sea salt grow collecting small cloud droplets form pollution particles thereby cleansing air therefore sea salt helps cleanse atmosphere air pollution via cloud processes implies oceans climatic aerosol indirect effects significantly smaller current estimates
