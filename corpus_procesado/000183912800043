melanopsin rod-cone photoreceptive systems account major accessory visual functions mice 
mammalian retina besides conventional rod-cone system melanopsin-associated photoreceptive system exists conveys photic information accessory visual functions pupillary light reflex circadian photo-entrainment1- ablation melanopsin gene retinal ganglion cells normally express melanopsin longer intrinsically photosensitive8 furthermore pupil reflex8 light-induced phase delays circadian clock910 period lengthening circadian rhythm constant light910 partially impaired investigated whether additional photoreceptive systems participate responses using mice lacking rods cones measured action spectrum phase-shifting circadian rhythm locomotor behaviour spectrum matches pupillary light reflex mice genotype11 intrinsic photosensitivity melanopsin-expressing retinal ganglion cells7 also generated mice lacking melanopsin coupled disabled rod cone phototransduction mechanisms animals intact retina fail show significant pupil reflex entrain light/dark cycles show masking response light thus rod-cone melanopsin systems together seem provide photic input accessory visual functions
