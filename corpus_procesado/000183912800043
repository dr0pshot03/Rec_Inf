melanopsin rod-cone photoreceptive systems account major accessory visual functions mice
mammalian retina besides conventional rod-cone system melanopsin-associated photoreceptive system exists conveys photic information accessory visual functions pupillary light reflex circadian photo-entrainment- ablation melanopsin gene retinal ganglion cells normally express melanopsin longer intrinsically photosensitive furthermore pupil reflex light-induced phase delays circadian clock period lengthening circadian rhythm constant light partially impaired investigated whether additional photoreceptive systems participate responses using mice lacking rods cones measured action spectrum phase-shifting circadian rhythm locomotor behaviour spectrum matches pupillary light reflex mice genotype intrinsic photosensitivity melanopsin-expressing retinal ganglion cells also generated mice lacking melanopsin coupled disabled rod cone phototransduction mechanisms animals intact retina fail show significant pupil reflex entrain light/dark cycles show masking response light thus rod-cone melanopsin systems together seem provide photic input accessory visual functions
