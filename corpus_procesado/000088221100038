large age pulsar b1757 upper limit proper motion 
characteristic age pulsar usually considered approximate true age assumption led puzzling results including fact many pulsars small characteristic ages associated supernova remnants pulsar b1757 located just outside edge supernova remnant- properties system indicate pulsar born centre remnant substantial velocity subsequently overtaken expanding blast wave- characteristic age yr pulsar expected proper motion milliarcseconds mas per year report observations nebula surrounding pulsar limit proper motion less mas yr- implying minimum age yr detailed analysis argues true age may great yr significantly larger characteristic age conclude result discrepancies associated pulsars characteristic ages greatly underestimate true ages pulsars
