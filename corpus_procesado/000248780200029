plant speciation
like formation animal species plant speciation characterized evolution barriers genetic exchange previously interbreeding populations prezygotic barriers impede mating fertilization species typically contribute total reproductive isolation plants postzygotic barriers hybrid offspring selected adaptive divergence response ecological factors pollinators habitat commonly drives evolution prezygotic barriers evolutionary forces responsible development intrinsic postzygotic barriers virtually unknown frequently result polymorphism incompatibility factors within species polyploid speciation entire genome duplicated particularly frequent plants perhaps polyploid plants often exhibit ecological differentiation local dispersal high fecundity perennial life history self-fertilization asexual reproduction finally species richness plants correlated many biological geohistorical factors increase ecological opportunities
