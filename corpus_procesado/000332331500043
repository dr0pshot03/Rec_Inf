quantifying molecular stiffness interaction lateral force microscopy 
spatial resolution atomic force microscopy afm can drastically increased terminating tip single carbon monoxide co molecule however co molecule stiff lateral forces around sides molecules distort images issue begs larger question afm can probe structures laterally weak lateral force microscopy lfm can probe lateral stiffnesses accessible normal-force afm resulting higher spatial resolution lfm determined torsional spring constant co-terminated tip molecule newtons per meter value less surface molecule example system whose stiffness product bonding partners also local environment
