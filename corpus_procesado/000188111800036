self-assembly mesoscopic metal-polymer amphiphiles
assembly properties two three-component rod-like building blocks consisting gold polymer block domains investigated structures behave like mesoscopic amphiphiles form series single-layer superstructures consisting bundles tubes sheets depending upon compositional periodicity unlike molecular systems template used initially synthesize plays critical role assembly process prealigning manner facilitates assembly optimizing correct collisional orientation upon dissolution template tubular structures tailorable diameters can assembled predictable manner basis estimate hybrid rod packing parameters
