human-level concept learning probabilistic program induction 
people learning new concepts can often generalize successfully just single example yet machine learning algorithms typically require tens hundreds examples perform similar accuracy people can also use learned concepts richer ways conventional algorithms-for action imagination explanation present computational model captures human learning abilities large class simple visual concepts: handwritten characters worlds alphabets model represents concepts simple programs best explain observed examples bayesian criterion challenging one-shot classification task model achieves human-level performance outperforming recent deep learning approaches also present several "visual turing tests" probing models creative generalization abilities many cases indistinguishable human behavior
