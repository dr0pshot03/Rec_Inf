local interactions select lower pathogen infectivity
theory suggests current rapid increase connectivity consequential changes structure human agricultural wildlife populations may select parasite strains higher infectivity carried test spatial theory experimentally altering individual host movement rates model host/pathogen system altering viscosity environment microevolutionary selection experiments infectivity virus predicted theory reduced viscous populations therefore provide empirical support theory population structure affects evolution infectious organisms
