biologically inspired artificial compound eyes
work presents fabrication biologically inspired artificial compound eyes artificial ommatidium like insects compound eyes consists refractive polymer microlens light-guiding polymer cone self-aligned waveguide collect light small angular acceptance ommatidia omnidirectionally arranged along hemispherical polymer dome provide wide field view similar natural compound eye spherical configuration microlenses accomplished reconfigurable microtemplating polymer replication using deformed elastomer membrane microlens patterns formation polymer waveguides self-aligned microlenses also realized self-writing process photosensitive polymer resin angular acceptance directly measured three-dimensional optical sectioning confocal microscope detailed optical characteristics studied comparison natural compound eye
