bifurcating pathway directs abscisic acid effects stomatal closure opening arabidopsis 
terrestrial plants lose water primarily stomata pores leaves hormone abscisic acid aba decreases water loss regulating opening closing stomata show phospholipase d alpha pld alpha mediates aba effects stomata interaction protein phosphatase 2c pp2c heterotrimeric gtp-binding protein g protein arabidopsis pld alpha produced phosphatidic acid pa binds abi1 pp2c signal aba-promoted stomatal closure whereas pld alpha pa interact g alpha subunit heterotrimeric g protein mediate aba inhibition stomatal opening results reveal bifurcating signaling pathway regulates plant water loss
