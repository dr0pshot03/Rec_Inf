strand-biased spreading mutations somatic hypermutation
somatic hypermutation shm major means diversity achieved antibody genes initiated deamination cytosines uracils dna activation-induced deaminase aid however process leads initiating deamination events mutations residues remains poorly understood demonstrate single cytosine top nontemplate strand sufficient recruit aid lead mutations upstream downstream a/t residues contrast targeting cytosines bottom strand aid lead substantial mutation neighboring residues strand asymmetry eliminated mice deficient mismatch repair indicating error-prone mismatch repair machinery preferentially targets top-strand uracils way promotes shm antibody response
