defective cd8 t cell memory following acute infection without cd4 t cell help 
cd8+ cytotoxic t cell response pathogens thought cd4+ helper t cell independent infectious agents provide inflammatory signals mice lack cd4+ t cells mount primary cd8 response listeria monocytogenes equal wild-type mice rapidly clear infection however protective memory challenge gradually lost former animals memory cd8+ t cells normal mice can respond rapidly memory cd8+ t cells generated without cd4 help defective ability respond secondary encounters antigen results highlight previously undescribed role cd4 help promoting protective cd8 memory development
