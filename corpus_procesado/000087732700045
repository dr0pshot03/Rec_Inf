enantioselective magnetochiral photochemistry 
many chemical physical systems can occur two forms distinguished solely mirror images phenomenon known chirality important biochemistry reactions involving chiral molecules often require participation one specific enantiomer mirror image two possible ones fact terrestrial life utilizes l enantiomers amino acids pattern known homochirality life stimulated long-standing efforts understand origin1 reactions can proceed enantioselectively chiral reactants catalysts involved external chiral influence present2 chiral reactants catalysts require enantioselective production process efforts understand homochirality life focused external chiral influences one external influence circularly polarized light can influence chirality photochemical reaction products21314 natural optical activity occurs exclusively media lacking mirror symmetry magnetic optical activity can occur media induced longitudinal magnetic fields cause polarization rotation light potential magnetically induced enantioselectivity chemical reactions investigated convincing demonstrations effect found2- show experimentally magnetochiral anisotropy-an effect linking chirality magnetism5--can give rise enantiomeric excess photochemical reaction driven unpolarized light parallel magnetic field suggests effect may played role origin homochirality life
