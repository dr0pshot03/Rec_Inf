hot x-ray-emitting plasma permeates clusters galaxies x-ray surface brightness often shows peak near centre cluster coincident drop entropy gas taken evidence cooling flow gas cools radiating away energy falls centre1 searches cool gas revealed significantly less predicted2 indicating mass deposition rate much lower expected clusters cooling flows however also host active galactic nucleus centres3 active galactic nuclei can inflate large bubbles hot plasma subsequently rise cluster atmosphere thus stirring cooling gas45 adding energy report highly resolved hydrodynamic simulations show buoyant bubbles increase cooling time inner regions clusters significantly reduce deposition cold gas
