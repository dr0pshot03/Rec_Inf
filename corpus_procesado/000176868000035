hot bubbles active galactic nuclei heat source cooling-flow clusters
hot x-ray-emitting plasma permeates clusters galaxies x-ray surface brightness often shows peak near centre cluster coincident drop entropy gas taken evidence cooling flow gas cools radiating away energy falls centre searches cool gas revealed significantly less predicted indicating mass deposition rate much lower expected clusters cooling flows however also host active galactic nucleus centres active galactic nuclei can inflate large bubbles hot plasma subsequently rise cluster atmosphere thus stirring cooling gas adding energy report highly resolved hydrodynamic simulations show buoyant bubbles increase cooling time inner regions clusters significantly reduce deposition cold gas
