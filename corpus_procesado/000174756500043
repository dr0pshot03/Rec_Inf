naturally secreted oligomers amyloid beta protein potently inhibit hippocampal long-term potentiation vivo
although extensive data support central pathogenic role amyloid beta protein abeta alzheimers disease amyloid hypothesis remains controversial part specific neurotoxic species abeta nature effects synaptic function defined vivo report natural oligomers human abeta formed soon generation peptide within specific intracellular vesicles subsequently secreted cell cerebral microinjection cell medium containing oligomers abundant abeta monomers amyloid fibrils markedly inhibited hippocampal long-term potentiation ltp rats vivo immunodepletion medium ab species completely abrogated effect pretreatment medium insulin-degrading enzyme degrades abeta monomers oligomers prevent inhibition ltp therefore abeta oligomers absence monomers amyloid fibrils disrupted synaptic plasticity vivo concentrations found human brain cerebrospinal fluid finally treatment cells gamma-secretase inhibitors prevented oligomer formation doses allowed appreciable monomer production medium longer disrupted ltp indicating synaptotoxic abeta oligomers can targeted therapeutically
