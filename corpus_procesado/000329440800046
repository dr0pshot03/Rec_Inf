modular organization axial microcircuits zebrafish 
locomotion requires precise control spinal networks tetrapods bipeds dynamic regulation locomotion simplified modular organization spinal limb circuits known whether predecessors fish axial circuits similarly organized demonstrate larval zebrafish spinal cord contains distinct parallel microcircuits independent control dorsal ventral musculature side body normal swimming dorsal ventral microcircuits equally active postural correction fish differentially engage microcircuits generate torque self-righting findings reveal greater complexity axial spinal networks responsible swimming previously recognized suggest early template modular organization more-complex locomotor circuits later vertebrates
