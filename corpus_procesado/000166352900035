electron spin resonance studies membranes proteins 
provide review current electron spin resonance esr techniques studying basic molecular mechanisms membranes proteins using nitroxide spin labels tn particular nitroxide spin label studies high-field/high-frequency esr two-dimensional fourier transform esr enable one accurately determine distances biomolecules unravel details complex dynamics proteins characterize dynamic structure membrane domains discriminate bulk lipids boundary lipids coat transmembrane peptides proteins studies can also provide time resolution studies functional dynamics proteins illustrate capabilities recent examples
