mechanism segregation age mammalian neural stem cells
throughout life neural stem cells nscs generate neurons mammalian brain using photobleaching experiments found cell division vitro within developing mouse forebrain nscs generate lateral diffusion barrier membrane endoplasmic reticulum thereby promoting asymmetric segregation cellular components diffusion barrier weakens age response impairment lamin-associated nuclear envelope constituents weakening diffusion barrier disrupts asymmetric segregation damaged proteins product aging damaged proteins asymmetrically inherited nonstem daughter cell embryonic young adult nsc divisions whereas older adult brain damaged proteins symmetrically distributed progeny thus data identify mechanism damage accumulates age asymmetrically distributed somatic stem cell division
