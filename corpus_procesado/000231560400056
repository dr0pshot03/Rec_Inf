fracture surface energy punchbowl fault san andreas system 
fracture energy form latent heat required create earthquake rupture surface related parameters governing rupture propagation processes slip weakening- fracture energy estimated seismological experimental rock deformation data- yet itsmagnitude mechanisms rupture surface formation processes leading slip weakening well defined- quantify structural observations punchbowl fault large-displacement exhumed fault san andreas fault system show energy required create fracture surface area fault times greater seismological estimates predict single large earthquake fracture energy attributed entirely production fracture surfaces fracture surface area punchbowl fault produced earthquake displacements totalling < km account small fraction total energy budget therefore additional processes probably contributed slip weakening earthquake rupture
