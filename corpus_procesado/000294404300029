genome-wide association studies gwas identified many risk loci complex diseases effect sizes typically small information underlying biological processes often lacking associations metabolic traits functional intermediates can overcome problems potentially inform individualized therapy report comprehensive analysis genotype-dependent metabolic phenotypes using gwas non-targeted metabolomics identified genetic loci associated blood metabolite concentrations show effect sizes unusually high gwas account -% differences metabolite levels per allele copy associations provide new functional insights many disease-related associations reported previous studies including cardiovascular kidney disorders type diabetes cancer gout venous thromboembolism crohns disease study advances knowledge genetic basis metabolic individuality humans generates many new hypotheses biomedical pharmaceutical research
