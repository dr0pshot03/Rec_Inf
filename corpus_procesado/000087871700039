dynamic self-assembly magnetized millimetre-sized objects rotating liquid-air interface
spontaneous pattern formation self-assembly long-standing- continuing interest aesthetic appeal also fundamental- technological relevance far study self-organization processes mainly focused static structures dynamic systems- develop order dissipating energy particular interest studying complex behaviour describe formation dynamic patterns millimetre-sized magnetic disks liquid-air interface subject magnetic field produced rotating permanent magnet disks spin around axes angular frequency equal magnet attracted towards axis rotation repelling repulsive hydrodynamic interaction due fluid motion associated spinning interplay attractive repulsive interactions leads formation patterns exhibiting various types ordering entirely new versatile system lead better understanding dynamic self-assembly providing test-bed stability theories interacting point vortices- vortex patches
