rhythm microbial adaptation 
evolutionary biologist studies steps miraculous adaptations characteristic every aspect organic world evolved general nature adaptive steps still unclear evolution often thought random dependent unpredictable events light one might expect steps taken adaptation completely random biologically temporally present mathematical derivation show contrary adaptive steps can fairly strong rhythm find strength adaptive rhythm relative temporal regularity equal constant microbial populations consequence numbers accumulated adaptations predicted universal variance/mean ratio theory derived potentially applicable study molecular evolution
