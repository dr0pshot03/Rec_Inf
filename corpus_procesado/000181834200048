microscopic dynamics liquid aluminum oxide 
collective excitations observed liquid aluminum oxide high temperatures combining containerless sample environment inelastic x-ray scattering excitation spectra show well-defined triplet peak structure lower wave vectors q nanometers- single quasi-elastic peak higher q high-q spectra well described kinetic theory low-q spectra require frequency-dependent viscosity provide previously unknown experimental constraints behavior liquids interface atomistic continuum theory
