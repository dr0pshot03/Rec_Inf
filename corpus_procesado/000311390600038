quantum-state resolved bimolecular collisions velocity-controlled oh radicals 
whereas atom-molecule collisions studied complete quantum-state resolution interactions two state-selected molecules proven much harder probe report measurement state-resolved inelastic scattering cross sections collisions two open-shell molecules prepared single quantum state stark-decelerated hydroxyl oh radicals scattered hexapole-focused nitric oxide radicals crossed-beam configuration rotationally spin-orbit inelastic scattering cross sections measured absolute scale collision energies cm- cross sections show fair agreement quantum coupled-channels calculations using set coupled model potential energy surfaces based ab initio calculations long-range nonadiabatic interactions simplistic short-range interaction comparison reveals crucial role electrostatic forces complex molecular collision processes
