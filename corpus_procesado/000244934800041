arctic air pollution: origins impacts
notable warming trends observed arctic although increased human-induced emissions long-lived greenhouse gases certainly main driving factor air pollutants aerosols ozone also important air pollutants transported arctic primarily eurasia leading high concentrations winter spring arctic haze local ship emissions summertime boreal forest fires may also important pollution sources aerosols ozone perturbing radiative budget arctic processes specific region: absorption solar radiation aerosols enhanced highly reflective snow ice surfaces deposition light-absorbing aerosols snow ice can decrease surface albedo tropospheric ozone forcing may also contributing warming region future increases pollutant emissions locally mid-latitudes accelerate global warming arctic
