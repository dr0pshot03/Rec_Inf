earthquake potential along northern hayward fault california
hayward fault slips large earthquakes aseismic creep observed along surface trace dislocation models surface deformation adjacent hayward fault measured global positioning system interferometric synthetic aperture radar favor creep similar millimeters per year bottom seismogenic zone along similar kilometer-long northern fault segment microearthquakes waveform repeatedly occur kilometer depths indicate deep creep millimeters per year difference current creep rates long-term slip rate similar millimeters per year can reconciled mechanical model freely slipping northern hayward fault adjacent locked earthquake rupture brake southern kilometers fault potential major independent earthquake northern hayward fault might less previously thought
