dislocation avalanches strain bursts problem plastic forming micrometer scale
stress many crystalline materials exhibit irreversible plastic deformation caused motion lattice dislocations plastically deformed microcrystals internal dislocation avalanches lead jumps stress-strain curves strain bursts whereas macroscopic samples plasticity appears smooth process combining three-dimensional simulations dynamics interacting dislocations statistical analysis corresponding deformation behavior determined distribution strain changes dislocation avalanches established dependence microcrystal size results suggest sample dimensions micrometer submicrometer scale large strain fluctuations may make difficult control resulting shape plastic-forming process
