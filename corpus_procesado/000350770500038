orientation columns mouse superior colliculus 
twenty types retinal ganglion cells conduct visual information eye rest brain retinal ganglion cell type tessellates retina regular mosaic every point visual space processed visual primitives contrast motion information flows two principal brain centres: visual cortex superior colliculus superior colliculus plays evolutionarily conserved role visual behaviours functional architecture poorly understood report population recordings visual responses neurons mouse superior colliculus many neurons respond preferentially lines certain orientation movement axis show cells similar orientation preferences form large patches span vertical thickness retinorecipient layers organization strikingly different randomly interspersed orientation preferences mouses visual cortex instead resembles orientation columns observed visual cortices large mammals- notably adjacent superior colliculus orientation columns limited receptive field overlap contrast organization visual cortex point visual field activates neurons preferred orientations instead superior colliculus favours specific contour orientations within similar degrees regions visual field finding implications behavioural responses mediated brain centre
