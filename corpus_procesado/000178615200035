stacking conical molecules fullerene apex polar columns crystals liquid crystals
polar liquid crystalline materials can used optical electronic applications recent interest turned formation strategies exploit shape polar molecules interactions direct molecular alignment example banana-shaped molecules align molecular bent within smectic layers whereas conical molecules form polar columnar assemblies- however flatness conical molecules used now- ability flip limited success approach making polar liquid crystalline materials show attachment five aromatic groups one pentagon c fullerene molecule yields deeply conical molecules stack polar columnar assemblies stacking driven attractive interactions spherical fullerene moiety hollow cone formed five aromatic side groups neighbouring molecule column packing pattern maintained extend aromatic groups attaching flexible aliphatic chains yields compounds thermotropic lyotropic liquid crystalline properties contrast previously reported fullerene-containing liquid crystals- exhibit thermotropic properties none contains fullerene moiety functional part mesogen units design strategy applicable molecules yield range new polar liquid crystalline materials
