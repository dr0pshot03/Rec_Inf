protein kinase anchoring protein makap coordinates two integrated camp effector pathways 
cyclic adenosine monophosphate camp ubiquitous mediator intracellular signalling events acts principally stimulation camp dependent protein kinases pkas also activates certain ion channels guanine nucleotide exchange factors epacs metabolism camp catalysed phosphodiesterases pdes identify camp responsive signalling complex maintained muscle-specific kinase anchoring protein makap includes pka pde4d3 epac1 intermolecular interactions facilitate dissemination distinct camp signals effector protein anchored pka stimulates pde4d3 reduce local camp concentrations whereas makap associated erk5 kinase module suppresses pde4d3 pde4d3 also functions adaptor protein recruits epac1 exchange factor small gtpase rap1 enable camp dependent attenuation erk5 pharmacological molecular manipulations makap complex show anchored erk5 can induce cardiomyocyte hypertrophy thus two coupled camp dependent feedback loops coordinated within context makap complex suggesting local control camp signalling akap proteins intricate previously appreciated
