deflection interstellar neutral hydrogen flow across heliospheric interface 
using absorption cell measured doppler shifts interstellar hydrogen resonance glow show direction neutral hydrogen flow enters inner heliosphere neutral hydrogen flow found deflected relative helium flow 4degrees likely explanation deflection distortion heliosphere action ambient interstellar magnetic field case helium flow vector hydrogen flow vector constrain direction magnetic field act interstellar magnetic compass
