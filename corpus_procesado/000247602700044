hiv proviral dna excision using evolved recombinase
hiv integrates host chromosome persists provirus flanked long terminal repeats ltrs date treatment regimens primarily target virus enzymes virus-cell fusion integrated provirus report substrate-linked protein evolution tailored recombinase recognizes asymmetric sequence within hiv ltr evolved recombinase efficiently excised integrated hiv proviral dna genome infected cells although long way use clinic speculate type technology might adapted future antiretroviral therapies among possible uses
