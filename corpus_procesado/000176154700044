spike train dynamics predicts theta-related phase precession hippocampal pyramidal cells
according temporal coding hypothesis neurons encode information exact timing spikes example temporal coding hippocampal phase precession phenomenon timing pyramidal cell spikes relative theta rhythm shows unidirectional forward precession spatial behaviour show phase precession occurs spatial non-spatial behaviours found spike phase correlated instantaneous discharge rate precessed unidirectionally high rates regardless behaviour spatial phase precession phenomenon therefore manifestation fundamental principle governing timing pyramidal cell discharge suggest intrinsic properties pyramidal cells key role determining spike times interplay magnitude dendritic excitation rhythmic inhibition somatic region responsible phase assignment spikes
