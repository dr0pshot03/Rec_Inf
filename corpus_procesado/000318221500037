structures human drosophila 80s ribosome
protein synthesis cells carried macromolecular machines called ribosomes although structures prokaryotic yeast protist ribosomes determined complex molecular architecture metazoan 80s ribosomes far remained elusive present structures drosophila melanogaster homo sapiens 80s ribosomes complex translation factor eef2 e-site transfer rna stm1-like proteins based high-resolution cryo-electron-microscopy density maps structures illustrate co-evolution metazoan-specific ribosomal rna ribosomal proteins also reveal presence two additional structural layers metazoan ribosomes well-ordered inner layer covered flexible rna outer layer human drosophila ribosome structures will provide basis detailed structural biochemical genetic experiments
