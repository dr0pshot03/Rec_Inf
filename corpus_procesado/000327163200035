dnmt1-interacting rnas block gene-specific dna methylation
dna methylation first described almost century ago however rules governing establishment maintenance remain elusive present data demonstrating active transcription regulates levels genomic methylation identify novel rna arising cebpa gene locus critical regulating local dna methylation profile rna binds dnmt1 prevents cebpa gene locus methylation deep sequencing transcripts associated dnmt1 combined genome-scale methylation expression profiling extend generality finding numerous gene loci collectively results delineate nature dnmt1-rna interactions suggest strategies gene-selective demethylation therapeutic targets human diseases
