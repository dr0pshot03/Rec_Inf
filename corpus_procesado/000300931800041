local structure amorphous silicon
widely believed continuous random network crn model represents structural topology amorphous silicon key evidence model can reproduce well experimental reduced density functions rdfs obtained diffraction using combination electron diffraction fluctuation electron microscopy fem variance data experimental constraints structural relaxation procedure show crn unique matching experimental rdf find inhomogeneous paracrystalline structures containing local cubic ordering angstrom length scale also fully consistent rdf data crucially also matched fem variance data unlike crn model paracrystalline model implications understanding phase transformation processes various materials extend beyond amorphous silicon
