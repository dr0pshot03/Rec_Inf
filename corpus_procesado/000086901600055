although cell movements vital establishing normal architecture embryos unclear movements regulated development vertebrates inhibition xenopus dishevelled xdsh function disrupts convergent extension movements cells gastrulation mechanism effect unclear cell fates affected drosophila dishevelled controls cell fate cell polarity- whether dishevelled involved controlling cell polarity vertebrate embryos investigated show using time-lapse confocal microscopy failure cells lacking xdsh function undergo convergent extension results defects cell polarity furthermore xdsh mutations inhibit convergent extension correspond mutations drosophila dishevelled selectively perturb planar cell polarity finally localization xdsh membrane normal dorsal mesodermal cells consistent xdsh controlling cell polarity results show polarized cell behaviour essential convergent extension controlled vertebrate dishevelled thus vertebrate equivalent drosophila planar cell polarity signalling cascade may required normal gastrulation
