forty years ago may proved sufficiently large complex ecological networks probability persisting close zero contrary previous expectations- may analysed large networks species interact random however natural systems pairs species well-defined interactions example predator-prey mutualistic competitive extend mays results relationships find remarkable differences predator-prey interactions stabilizing mutualistic competitive interactions destabilizing provide analytic stability criteria cases use criteria prove counterintuitively probability stability predator-prey networks decreases realistic food web structure imposed large preponderance weak interactions similarly stability negatively affected nestedness- bipartite mutualistic networks results found separating contribution network structure interaction strengths stability stable predator-prey networks can arbitrarily large complex provided predator-prey pairs tightly coupled stability criteria widely applicable hold system differential equations
