strong astrophysical constraint violation special relativity quantum gravity 
special relativity asserts physical phenomena appear unaccelerated observers called lorentz symmetry relates long wavelengths short ones: symmetry exact implies space-time must look length scales several approaches quantum gravity however suggest may microscopic structure space-time leads violation lorentz symmetry might arise discreteness1 non-commutivity2 space-time action extra dimensions3 determine strong constraint type lorentz violation produces maximum electron speed less speed light use observation -mev synchrotron radiation crab nebula improve previous limit factor million ruling type lorentz violation thereby providing important constraint theories quantum gravity
