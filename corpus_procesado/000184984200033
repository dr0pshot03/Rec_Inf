strong astrophysical constraint violation special relativity quantum gravity 
special relativity asserts physical phenomena appear unaccelerated observers called lorentz symmetry relates long wavelengths short ones: symmetry exact implies space-time must look length scales several approaches quantum gravity however suggest may microscopic structure space-time leads violation lorentz symmetry might arise discreteness non-commutivity space-time action extra dimensions determine strong constraint type lorentz violation produces maximum electron speed less speed light use observation mev synchrotron radiation crab nebula improve previous limit factor million ruling type lorentz violation thereby providing important constraint theories quantum gravity
