system stable expression short interfering rnas mammalian cells 
mammalian genetic approaches study gene function hampered lack toots generate stable loss-of-function phenotypes efficiently report new vector system named psuper directs synthesis small interfering rnas sirnas mammalian cells show sirna expression mediated vector causes efficient specific down-regulation gene expression resulting functional inactivation targeted genes stable expression sirnas using vector mediates persistent suppression gene expression allowing analysis loss-of-function phenotypes develop longer periods time therefore psuper vector constitutes new powerful system analyze gene function variety mammalian cell types
