formation arf lpdarf: catalytic conversion aryl triflates aryl fluorides 
despite increasing pharmaceutical importance fluorinated aromatic organic molecules remain difficult synthesize present methods require either harsh reaction conditions highly specialized reagents making preparation complex fluoroarenes challenging thus development general methods preparation overcome limitations techniques currently use great interest prepared [lpdiiarf] complexes l biaryl monophosphine ligand ar aryl group identified conditions reductive elimination occurs form ar-f bond basis results developed catalytic process converts aryl bromides aryl triflates corresponding fluorinated arenes using simple fluoride salts expect method allow introduction fluorine atoms advanced highly functionalized intermediates
