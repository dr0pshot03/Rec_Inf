transcriptome-wide noise controls lineage choice mammalian progenitor cells 
phenotypic cell-to-cell variability within clonal populations may manifestation gene expression noise- may reflect stable phenotypic variants non-genetic cell individuality can arise slow fluctuations protein levels mammalian cells fluctuations produce persistent cell individuality thereby rendering clonal population heterogeneous however remains unknown whether heterogeneity may account stochasticity cell fate decisions stem cells show clonal populations mouse haematopoietic progenitor cells spontaneous outlier cells either extremely high low expression levels stem cell marker sca also known ly6a ref reconstitute parental distribution sca one week slow relaxation described gaussian mixture model incorporates noise driven transitions discrete subpopulations suggesting hidden multi-stability within one cell type despite clonality sca outliers distinct transcriptomes although unique gene expression profiles eventually reverted median cells revealing attractor state lasted long enough confer greatly different proclivity choosing either erythroid myeloid lineage preference lineage choice associated increased expression lineage-specific transcription factors > fold increase gata1 ref among erythroid-prone cells > fold increased pu sfpi1 ref expression among myeloid-prone cells thus clonal heterogeneity gene expression level due independent noise expression individual genes reflects metastable states slowly fluctuating transcriptome distinct individual cells may govern reversible stochastic priming multipotent progenitor cells cell fate decision
