conserved xiap-interaction motif caspase smac/diablo regulates caspase activity apoptosis 
x-linked inhibitor-of-apoptosis protein xiap interacts caspase inhibits activity- whereas smac also known diablo relieves inhibition interaction xiap- show xiap associates active caspase--apaf holoenzyme complex binding amino terminus linker peptide small subunit caspase- becomes exposed proteolytic processing procaspase asp supporting observation point mutations abrogate proteolytic processing catalytic activity caspase- deletion linker peptide prevented caspase association xiap concomitant inhibition note n-terminal four residues caspase linker peptide share significant homology n-terminal tetra-peptide mature smac drosophila proteins hid/grim/reaper defining conserved class iap-binding motifs consistent finding binding caspase linker peptide smac bir3 domain xiap mutually exclusive suggesting smac potentiates caspase activity disrupting interaction linker peptide caspase bir3 studies reveal mechanism binding bir3 domain two conserved peptides one smac one caspase- opposing effects caspase activity apoptosis
