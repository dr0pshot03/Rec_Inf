transcriptomic analysis autistic brain reveals convergent molecular pathology 
autism spectrum disorder asd common highly heritable neurodevelopmental condition characterized marked genetic heterogeneity- thus fundamental question whether autism represents aetiologically heterogeneous disorder myriad genetic environmental risk factors perturb common underlying molecular pathways brain demonstrate consistent differences transcriptome organization autistic normal brain gene co-expression network analysis remarkably regional patterns gene expression typically distinguish frontal temporal cortex significantly attenuated asd brain suggesting abnormalities cortical patterning identify discrete modules co-expressed genes associated autism: neuronal module enriched known autism susceptibility genes including neuronal specific splicing factor a2bp1 also known fox1 module enriched immune genes glial markers using high-throughput rna sequencing demonstrate dysregulated splicing a2bp1-dependent alternative exons asd brain moreover using published autism genome-wide association study gwas data set show neuronal module enriched genetically associated variants providing independent support causal involvement genes autism contrast immune-glial module showed enrichment autism gwas signals indicating non-genetic aetiology process collectively results provide strong evidence convergent molecular abnormalities asd implicate transcriptional splicing dysregulation underlying mechanisms neuronal dysfunction disorder
