regioselective ketone alpha-alkylation simple olefins via dual activation 
alkylation carbonyl compounds commonly used carbon-carbon bond-forming reaction however conventional enolate alkylation approach remains problematic due lack regioselectivity risk overalkylation need strongly basic conditions expensive alkyl halide reagents describe development ketone-alkylation strategy using simple olefins alkylating agents strategy employs bifunctional catalyst comprising secondary amine low-valent rhodium complex capable activating ketones olefins simultaneously cyclic acyclic ketones can mono-alpha-alkylated simple terminal olefins ethylene propylene -hexene styrene selectively less hindered site; large number functional groups tolerated ph/redox neutral byproduct-free nature dual-activation approach shows promise large-scale syntheses
