altered tcr signaling geometrically repatterned immunological synapses 
immunological synapse specialized cell-cell junction defined large-scale spatial patterns receptors signaling molecules yet remains largely enigmatic terms formation function used supported bilayer membranes nanometer-scale structures fabricated onto underlying substrate impose geometric constraints immunological synapse formation analysis resulting alternatively patterned synapses revealed causal relation radial position t cell receptors tcrs signaling activity prolonged signaling tcr microclusters mechanically trapped peripheral regions synapse results consistent model synapse spatial translocation tcrs represents direct mechanism signal regulation
