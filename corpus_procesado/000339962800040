environmental controls govern end product bacterial nitrate respiration 
biogeochemical nitrogen cycle microbial respiration processes compete nitrate electron acceptor denitrification converts nitrate nitrogenous gas thus removes fixed nitrogen biosphere whereas ammonification converts nitrate ammonium directly reusable primary producers combined multiple parallel long-term incubations marine microbial nitrate-respiring communities isotope labeling metagenomics unravel specific environmental conditions select either process microbial generation time supply nitrite relative nitrate carbon/nitrogen ratio identified key environmental controls determine whether nitrite will reduced nitrogenous gas ammonium results define microbial ecophysiology biogeochemical feedback loop key global change eutrophication wastewater treatment
