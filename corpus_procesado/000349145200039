programming colloidal phase transitions dna strand displacement 
dna-grafted nanoparticles called programmable atom-equivalents: like atoms form three-dimensional crystals unlike atoms particles carry information sequences grafted strands can used program equilibrium crystal structures show programmability colloids can generalized full temperature-dependent phase diagram just crystal structures add information buffer form soluble dna strands designed compete grafted strands strand displacement using two displacement reactions program phase behavior found atomic systems dna-grafted colloids including arbitrarily wide gas-solid coexistence reentrant melting even reversible transitions distinct crystal phases
