secondary replicative function cd8+ t cells developed effector phenotype
models differentiation memory cd8+ t cells replicate secondary infections differ whether cells acquired effector function primary infections created transgenic mouse line permits mapping fate granzyme b gzmb expressing cd8+ t cells progeny indelibly marking enhanced yellow fluorescent protein eyfp virus specific cd8+ t cells express gzmb within first days primary response infection influenza without impairment continued primary clonal expansion secondary infection virus specific cd8+ t cells became eyfp+ primary infection clonally expand well virus specific cd8+ t cells thus cd8+ t cells acquired effector phenotype primary infection may function memory cells replicative function
