diapiric flow subduction zones: recipe rapid transport
recent geochemical studies uranium-thorium series disequilibrium rocks subduction zones require magmas transported mantle just subducting slab surface little similar years present series laboratory experiments investigate characteristic time scales flow patterns diapiric upwelling model subduction zone magmatism results indicate interaction buoyantly upwelling diapirs subduction-induced flow mantle creates network low-density low-viscosity conduits buoyant flow rapid yielding transport times commensurate indicated uranium-thorium studies
