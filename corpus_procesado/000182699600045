universal scaling relations food webs
structure ecological communities usually represented food webs- webs describe species means vertices connected links representing predations can therefore study different webs considering shape topology networks comparing food webs searching regularities fundamental importance universal patterns reveal common principles underlying organization different ecosystems however features observed small food webs- different found large ones- furthermore food webs except isolated cases share general features types network including internet world wide web biological webs features small-world character scale-free power-law distribution degree number links per vertex propose describe food webs transportation networks extending concept allometric scaling- branching properties change network size decompose food webs spanning trees loop-forming links show whereas number loops varies significantly across real webs spanning trees characterized universal scaling relations
