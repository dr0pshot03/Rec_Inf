hiv neutralizing antibodies induced native-like envelope trimers
challenge hiv immunogen design difficulty inducing neutralizing antibodies nabs neutralization-resistant tier viruses dominate human transmissions show soluble recombinant hiv envelope glycoprotein trimer adopts native conformation bg505 sosip induced nabs potently sequence-matched tier virus rabbits similar weaker responses macaques trimer also consistently induced cross-reactive nabs sensitive tier viruses tier nabs recognized conformational epitopes differed animals cases overlapped recognized broadly neutralizing antibodies bnabs whereas tier responses targeted linear v3 epitopes second trimer b41 sosip also induced strong autologous tier nab response rabbits thus native-like trimers represent promising starting point development hiv vaccines aimed inducing bnabs
