nucleolar proteome dynamics 
nucleolus key organelle coordinates synthesis assembly ribosomal subunits forms nucleus around repeated ribosomal gene clusters production ribosomes major metabolic activity function nucleolus tightly linked cell growth proliferation recent data suggest nucleolus also plays important role cell-cycle regulation senescence stress responses1- using mass-spectrometry-based organellar proteomics stable isotope labelling5 perform quantitative analysis proteome human nucleoli vivo fluorescent imaging techniques directly compared endogenous protein changes measured proteomics characterize flux endogenous nucleolar proteins response three different metabolic inhibitors affect nucleolar morphology proteins stably associated rna polymerase subunits small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle complexes exit accumulate nucleolus similar kinetics whereas protein components large small ribosomal subunits leave nucleolus markedly different kinetics data establish quantitative proteomic approach temporal characterization protein flux cellular organelles demonstrate nucleolar proteome changes significantly time response changes cellular growth conditions
