activation transcription factor nf-kappa b requires elks kappa b kinase regulatory subunit
nuclear factor-kappa b nf-kappab family transcription factors plays seminal role inflammation apoptosis development cancer modulation nf-kappab-mediated gene expression response diverse signals coordinated ikappab kinase ikk complex identified elks essential regulatory subunit ikk complex silencing elks expression rna interference blocked induced expression nf-kappab target genes including nf-kappab inhibitor ikappabalpha proinflammatory genes cyclo-oxygenase interleukin cells also protected apoptosis response cytokines elks likely functions recruiting ikappabalpha ikk complex thus serves regulatory function ikk activation
