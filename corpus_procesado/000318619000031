lorentz meets fano spectral line shapes: universal phase laser control 
symmetric lorentzian asymmetric fano line shapes fundamental spectroscopic signatures quantify structural dynamical properties nuclei atoms molecules solids study introduces universal temporal-phase formalism mapping fano asymmetry parameter q phase time-dependent dipole response function formalism confirmed experimentally laser-transforming fano absorption lines autoionizing helium lorentzian lines attosecond-pulsed excitation also demonstrate inverse transformation naturally lorentzian line fano profile application formalism uses quantum-phase control amplify extreme-ultraviolet light resonantly interacting atoms quantum phase excited states response interactions can thus extracted line-shape analysis applications many branches spectroscopy
