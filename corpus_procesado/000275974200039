coronary arteries form developmental reprogramming venous cells 
coronary artery disease leading cause death worldwide determining coronary artery developmental program aid understanding disease lead new treatments many aspects process including developmental origin remain obscure show using histological clonal analysis mice cardiac organ culture coronary vessels arise angiogenic sprouts sinus venosus-the vein returns blood embryonic heart sprouting venous endothelial cells dedifferentiate migrate invade myocardium invading cells differentiate arteries capillaries; cells surface redifferentiate veins results show differentiated venous cells retain developmental plasticity indicate position-specific cardiac signals trigger dedifferentiation conversion coronary arteries capillaries veins understanding new reprogramming process identifying endogenous signals suggest natural ways engineering coronary bypass grafts revascularizing heart
