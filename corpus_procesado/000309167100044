popularity versus similarity growing networks 
principle popularity attractive underlies preferential attachment common explanation emergence scaling growing networks new connections made preferentially popular nodes resulting distribution number connections possessed nodes follows power laws observed many real networks preferential attachment directly validated real networks including internet can consequence different underlying processes based node fitness ranking optimization random walks duplication- show popularity just one dimension attractiveness another dimension similarity- develop framework new connections optimize certain trade-offs popularity similarity instead simply preferring popular nodes framework geometric interpretation popularity preference emerges local optimization opposed preferential attachment optimization framework accurately describes large-scale evolution technological internet social trust relationships people biological escherichia coli metabolic networks predicting probability new links high precision framework developed can thus used predicting new links evolving networks provides different perspective preferential attachment emergent phenomenon
