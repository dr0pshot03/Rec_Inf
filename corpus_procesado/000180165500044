structure escherichia coli ribosomal termination complex release factor
termination protein synthesis occurs messenger rna presents stop codon ribosomal aminoacyl site class release factor proteins rf1 rf2 believed recognize stop codons via tripeptide motifs leading release completed polypeptide chain covalent attachment transfer rna ribosomal peptidyl p site class rfs possess conserved ggq amino-acid motif thought involved directly protein-transfer-rna bond hydrolysis crystal structures bacterial eukaryotic class rfs determined mechanism stop codon recognition peptidyl-trna hydrolysis remains unclear present structure escherichia coli ribosome post-termination complex rf2 obtained single-particle cryo-electron microscopy cryo-em fitting known 70s rf2 structures electron density map reveals rf2 adopts different conformation ribosome compared crystal structure isolated protein amino-terminal helical domain rf2 contacts factor-binding site ribosome spf loop protein situated close mrna ggq-containing domain rf2 interacts peptidyl-transferase centre ptc connecting ribosomal decoding centre ptc rf2 functionally mimics trna molecule site translational termination eukaryotes likely based similar mechanism
