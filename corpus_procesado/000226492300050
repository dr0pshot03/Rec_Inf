carotenoid cation formation regulation photosynthetic light harvesting 
photosynthetic light harvesting excess light regulated process known feedback deexcitation femtosecond transient absorption measurements thylakoid membranes show selective formation carotenoid radical cation upon excitation chlorophyll conditions maximum steady-state feedback deexcitation studies transgenic arabidopsis thaliana plants confirmed carotenoid radical cation formation correlated feedback deexcitation requires presence zeaxanthin specific carotenoid synthesized high light exposure results indicate energy transfer chlorophyll molecules chlorophyll-zeaxanthin heterodimer undergoes charge separation mechanism excess energy dissipation feedback deexcitation
