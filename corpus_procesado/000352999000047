engineering superhelicase conformational control 
conformational control biomolecular activities can reveal functional insights enable engineering novel activities show conformational control intramolecular cross-linking helicase monomer undetectable unwinding activity converts superhelicase can unwind thousands base pairs processively even large opposing force natural partner enhances helicase activity shown achieve stimulating role also selectively stabilizing active conformation work provides insight regulation nucleic acid unwinding activity introduces monomeric superhelicase without nuclease activities may useful biotechnological applications
