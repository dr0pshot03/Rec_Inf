identification ubiquitin ligases required skeletal muscle atrophy 
skeletal muscle adapts decreases activity load undergoing atrophy identify candidate molecular mediators muscle atrophy performed transcript profiling although many genes up-regulated single rat model atrophy small subset universal atrophy models two genes encode ubiquitin ligases: muscle ring finger murf1 gene designate muscle atrophy f-box mafbx latter member scf family e3 ubiquitin ligases overexpression mafbx myotubes produced atrophy whereas mice deficient either mafbx murf1 found resistant atrophy proteins potential drug targets treatment muscle atrophy
