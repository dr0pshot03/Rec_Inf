universal scaling respiratory metabolism size nitrogen plants 
scaling respiratory metabolism body size animals considered fundamental law nature1- substantial evidence approximate /-power relation studies suggest plant respiratory metabolism also scales /-power mass12- higher plant animal scaling follow similar rules owing predominance fractal-like transport networks associated allometric scaling8- however using data obtained laboratory field-grown plants species four experiments show whole-plant respiration rate scales approximately isometrically scaling exponent approximate total plant mass individual experiments common relation across data moreover consistent theories biochemically based physiological scaling15- isometric scaling whole-plant respiration rate total nitrogen content observed within across data sets single relation common data isometric scaling unaffected growth conditions including variation light nitrogen availability temperature atmospheric co2 concentration similar within among species functional groups findings suggest plants animals follow different metabolic scaling relations driven distinct mechanisms
