extraction weak climatic signal ecosystem 
complexity ecosystems can cause subtle chaotic responses changes external forcing although ecosystems may normally behave chaotically sensitivity external influences associated nonlinearity can lead amplification climatic signals strong correlations el nino index rainfall maize yield zimbabwe demonstrated correlation maize yield stronger rainfall second example -year ice-age cycle may arise weak cycle radiation influence concentration atmospheric co2 ref integration weak climatic signal yet demonstrated realistic theoretical system use particular climatic phenomenon-the observed association plankton populations around uk position gulf stream-as probe demonstrate detailed marine ecosystem model extracts weak signal spread across different meteorological variables biological systems may therefore respond climatic signals dominate driving variables
