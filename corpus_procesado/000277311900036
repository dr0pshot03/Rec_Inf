cis-interactions notch delta generate mutually exclusive signalling states 
notch-delta signalling pathway allows communication neighbouring cells development critical role formation fine-grained patterns generating distinct cell fates among groups initially equivalent neighbouring cells sharply delineating neighbouring regions developing tissues- delta ligand shown two activities: transactivates notch neighbouring cells cis-inhibits notch cell however remains unclear notch integrates two activities resulting system facilitates pattern formation report development quantitative time-lapse microscopy platform analysing notch-delta signalling dynamics individual mammalian cells aim addressing issues controlling cis trans-delta concentrations monitoring dynamics notch reporter measured combined cis-trans input-output relationship notch-delta system data revealed striking difference responses notch trans-and cis-delta: whereas response trans-delta graded response cis-delta sharp occurs fixed threshold independent trans-delta developed simple mathematical model shows behaviours emerge mutual inactivation notch delta proteins cell interaction generates ultrasensitive switch mutually exclusive sending high delta/low notch receiving high notch/low delta signalling states multicellular level switch can amplify small differences neighbouring cells even without transcription-mediated feedback notch-delta signalling switch facilitates formation sharp boundaries lateral-inhibition patterns models development provides insight previously unexplained mutant behaviours
