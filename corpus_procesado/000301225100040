isolated metal atom geometries strategy selective heterogeneous hydrogenations 
facile dissociation reactants weak binding intermediates key requirements efficient selective catalysis however two variables intimately linked way generally allow optimization properties simultaneously using desorption measurements combination high-resolution scanning tunneling microscopy show individual isolated pd atoms cu surface substantially lower energy barrier hydrogen uptake subsequent desorption cu metal surface facile hydrogen dissociation pd atom sites weak binding cu allow selective hydrogenation styrene acetylene compared pure cu pd metal alone
