greater disruption due failure inhibitory control ambiguous distractor
considerable evidence indicates stimulus subthreshold thus consciously invisible influences brain activity behavioral performance however clear subthreshold stimuli processed brain found task-irrelevant subthreshold coherent motion led stronger disturbance task performance suprathreshold motion subthreshold motion activity visual cortex measured functional magnetic resonance imaging higher activity lateral prefrontal cortex lower suprathreshold motion results suggest subthreshold irrelevant signals subject effective inhibitory control
