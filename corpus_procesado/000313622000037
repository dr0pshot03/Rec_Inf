bright dark polar deposits mercury: evidence surface volatiles 
measurements surface reflectance permanently shadowed areas near mercurys north pole reveal regions anomalously dark bright deposits -nanometer wavelength reflectance anomalies concentrated poleward-facing slopes spatially collocated areas high radar backscatter postulated result near-surface water ice correlation observed reflectance modeled temperatures indicates optically bright regions consistent surface water ice whereas dark regions consistent surface layer complex organic material likely overlies buried ice provides thermal insulation impacts comets volatile-rich asteroids provided dark bright deposits
