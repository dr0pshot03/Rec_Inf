cosmic microwave background radiation temperature redshift 
existence cosmic microwave background radiation fundamental prediction hot big bang cosmology temperature increase increasing redshift present time redshift z temperature determined high precision t-cmbr +/ k principle background temperature can determined using measurements relative populations atomic fine-structure levels excited background radiation previous measurements achieved upper limits thus still formally permitting radiation temperature constant increasing redshift report detection absorption lines first second fine-structure levels neutral carbon atoms isolated cloud gas z also detected absorption due several rotational transitions molecular hydrogen fine-structure lines singly ionized carbon constraints enable us determine background radiation indeed warmer past: rnd t-cmbrz k accord temperature k predicted hot big bang cosmology
