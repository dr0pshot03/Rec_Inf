experimental theoretical study mitotic spindle orientation 
architecture adhesiveness cell microenvironment critical factor regulation spindle orientation vivo12 using combination theory experiments investigated spindle orientation hela human cells show spindle orientation can understood result action cortical force generators interact spindle microtubules activated cortical cues develop simple physical description spindle mechanics allows us calculate angular profiles torque acting spindle well angular distribution spindle orientations model accounts preferred spindle orientation shape full angular distribution spindle orientations observed large variety different cellular microenvironment geometries also correctly describes asymmetric spindle orientations observed certain distributions cortical cues conclude basis simple assumptions can provide quantitative description spindle orientation adherent cells
