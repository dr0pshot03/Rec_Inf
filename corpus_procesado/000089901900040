glacial/interglacial variations atmospheric carbon dioxide 
twenty years ago measurements ice cores showed concentration carbon dioxide atmosphere lower ice ages today yet broadly accepted explanation difference current investigations focus oceans biological pump sequestration carbon ocean interior rain organic carbon surface ocean effect burial calcium carbonate marine sediments researchers surmise whole-ocean reservoir algal nutrients larger glacial times strengthening biological pump low latitudes nutrients currently limiting others propose biological pump efficient glacial times complete utilization nutrients high latitudes much nutrient supply currently goes unused present version latter hypothesis focuses open ocean surrounding antarctica involving biology physics region
