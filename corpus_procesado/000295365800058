chromosome segregation errors cause dna damage structural chromosome aberrations
various types chromosomal aberrations including numerical aneuploidy structural e g translocations deletions commonly found human tumors linked tumorigenesis aneuploidy direct consequence chromosome segregation errors mitosis whereas structural aberrations caused improperly repaired dna breaks demonstrate chromosome segregation errors can also result structural chromosome aberrations chromosomes missegregate frequently damaged cytokinesis triggering dna double-strand break response respective daughter cells involving atm chk2 p53 show double-strand breaks can lead unbalanced translocations daughter cells data show segregation errors can cause translocations provide insights role whole-chromosome instability tumorigenesis
