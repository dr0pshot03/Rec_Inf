opposite effects fear conditioning extinction dendritic spine remodelling 
generally believed fear extinction form new learning inhibits rather erases previously acquired fear memories1- although view gained much support behavioural electrophysiological studies1- hypothesis extinction causes partial erasure fear memories remains viable using transcranial two-photon microscopy1112 investigated neural circuits modified fear learning extinction examining formation elimination postsynaptic dendritic spines layer-v pyramidal neurons mouse frontal association cortex show fear conditioning pairing auditory cue footshock increases rate spine elimination contrast fear extinction repeated presentation auditory cue without footshock increases rate spine formation degrees spine remodelling induced fear conditioning extinction strongly correlate expression extinction conditioned fear responses respectively notably spine elimination formation induced fear conditioning extinction occur dendritic branches cue-and location-specific manner: cue-specific extinction causes formation dendritic spines within distance two micrometres spines eliminated fear conditioning furthermore reconditioning preferentially induces elimination dendritic spines formed extinction thus within vastly complex neuronal networks fear conditioning extinction reconditioning lead opposing changes level individual synapses findings also suggest fear memory traces partially erased extinction
