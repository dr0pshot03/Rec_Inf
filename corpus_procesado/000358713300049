spectroscopic observation resonances f + h- reaction 
photodetachment spectroscopy fh2 fd2 anions allows direct observation reactive resonances benchmark reaction f + h- > h-f + h using cooled anion precursors high-resolution electron spectrometer observe several narrow peaks seen previous experiments theoretical calculations based highly accurate f + h- potential energy surface convincingly assign peaks resonances associated quasibound states hf + h df + d product arrangements quasibound state transition state region f + h- reaction calculations also reveal quasibound states reactant arrangement yet resolved experimentally
