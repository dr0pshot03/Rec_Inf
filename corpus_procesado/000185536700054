salmonella sipa polymerizes actin stapling filaments nonglobular protein arms
like many bacterial pathogens salmonella spp use type iii secretion system inject virulence proteins host cells salmonella invasion protein sipa binds host actin enhances polymerization near adherent extracellular bacteria contributes cytoskeletal rearrangements internalize pathogen combining x-ray crystallography sipa electron microscopy image analysis sipa-actin laments show sipa functions molecular staple globular domain two nonglobular arms mechanically stabilize lament tethering actin subunits opposing strands deletion analysis tethering arms provides strong support model
