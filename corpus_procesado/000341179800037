poly-dipeptides encoded c9orf72 repeats bind nucleoli impede rna biogenesis kill cells
many rna regulatory proteins controlling pre-messenger rna splicing contain serine: arginine sr repeats found sr domains bound hydrogel droplets composed fibrous polymers low-complexity domain heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein a2 hnrnpa2 hydrogel binding reversed upon phosphorylation sr domain cdc2-like kinases clk1/ mutated variants sr domains changing serine glycine sr-to-gr variants also bound hnrnpa2 hydrogels affected clk1/ expressed mammalian cells variants bound nucleoli translation products sense antisense transcripts expansion repeats associated c9orf72 gene altered neurodegenerative disease encode grn prn repeat polypeptides peptides bound hnrnpa2 hydrogels independent clk1/ activity applied cultured cells peptides entered cells migrated nucleus bound nucleoli poisoned rna biogenesis caused cell death
