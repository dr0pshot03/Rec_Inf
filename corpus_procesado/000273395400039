targeted processing antisense transcripts triggers arabidopsis flc chromatin silencing 
noncoding rna emerging important regulator gene expression many organisms characterizing rna-mediated chromatin silencing arabidopsis major floral repressor gene flc suppressor mutagenesis identify requirement cstf64 cstf77 two conserved rna -end-processing factors flc silencing however flc sense transcript processing affected mutants instead cstf64 cstf77 required processing flc antisense transcripts specific rna-binding protein directs activity proximal antisense polyadenylation site targeted processing triggers localized histone demethylase activity results reduced flc sense transcription targeted processing antisense transcripts may common mechanism triggering transcriptional silencing corresponding sense gene
