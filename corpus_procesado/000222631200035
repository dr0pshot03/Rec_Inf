single spin detection magnetic resonance force microscopy
magnetic resonance imaging mri well known powerful technique visualizing subsurface structures three-dimensional spatial resolution pushing resolution mum remains major challenge however owing sensitivity limitations conventional inductive detection techniques currently smallest volume elements image must contain least nuclear spins mri-based microscopy electron spins electron spin resonance microscopy magnetic resonance force microscopy mrfm proposed means improve detection sensitivity single-spin level thus enable three-dimensional imaging macromolecules example proteins atomic resolution mrfm also proposed qubit readout device spin-based quantum computers report detection individual electron spin mrfm spatial resolution nm one dimension obtained unpaired spin silicon dioxide measured signal consistent model spin aligned parallel anti-parallel effective field rotating-frame relaxation time ms long relaxation time suggests state individual spin can monitored extended periods time even subjected complex set manipulations part mrfm measurement protocol
