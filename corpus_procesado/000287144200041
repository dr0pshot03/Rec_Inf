asymmetric additions dienes catalysed dithiophosphoric acid 
chiral bronsted acids proton donors shown facilitate broad range asymmetric chemical transformations catalytic conditions without requiring additional toxic expensive metals1- although catalysts developed thus far remarkably effective activating polarized functional groups clear whether organic bronsted acids can used catalyse highly enantioselective transformations unactivated carbon-carbon multiple bonds deficiency persists despite fact racemic acid-catalysed markovnikov additions alkenes well known chemical transformations show chiral dithiophosphoric acids can catalyse intramolecular hydroamination hydroarylation dienes allenes generate heterocyclic products exceptional yield enantiomeric excess present mechanistic hypothesis involves addition acid catalyst diene followed nucleophilic displacement resulting dithiophosphate intermediate; also report mass spectroscopic deuterium labelling studies support proposed mechanism catalysts concepts revealed study prove applicable asymmetric functionalizations unsaturated systems
