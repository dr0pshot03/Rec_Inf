collective synthesis natural products means organocascade catalysis
organic chemists now able synthesize small quantities almost known natural product given sufficient time resources effort however translation academic successes total synthesis large-scale construction complex natural products development large collections biologically relevant molecules present significant challenges synthetic chemists show application two nature-inspired techniques namely organocascade catalysis collective natural product synthesis can facilitate preparation useful quantities range structurally diverse natural products common molecular scaffold power concept demonstrated expedient asymmetric total syntheses six well-known alkaloid natural products: strychnine aspidospermidine vincadifformine akuammicine kopsanone kopsinine
