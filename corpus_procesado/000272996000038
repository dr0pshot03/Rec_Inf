chromatin remodeller acf acts dimeric motor space nucleosomes
evenly spaced nucleosomes directly correlate condensed chromatin gene silencing atp-dependent chromatin assembly factor acf forms structures vitro required silencing vivo acf generates maintains nucleosome spacing constantly moving nucleosome towards longer flanking dna faster shorter flanking dna enzyme rapidly moves back forth sides nucleosome accomplish bidirectional movement unknown show nucleosome movement depends cooperatively two acf molecules indicating acf functions dimer atpases nucleotide state determines whether dimer closely engages one sides nucleosome three-dimensional reconstruction single-particle electron microscopy atpase-nucleosome complex activated atp state reveals dimer architecture two atpases face results indicate model two atpases work coordinated manner taking turns engage either side nucleosome thereby allowing processive bidirectional movement novel dimeric motor mechanism differs dimeric motors kinesin dimeric helicases processively translocate unidirectionally reflects unique challenges faced motors move nucleosomes
