single-cell dna-methylation analysis reveals epigenetic chimerism preimplantation embryos 
epigenetic alterations increasingly recognized causes human cancers disease aberrations likely arise genomic reprogramming mammalian preimplantation embryos epigenomes vulnerable however process partially understood experimental inaccessibility early-stage embryos introduce methodologic advance probing single cells various dna-methylation errors multiple loci reveal failed maintenance epigenetic mark results chimeric mice display unpredictable phenotypes leading developmental arrest yet show mouse pronuclear transfer can used ameliorate reprogramming defects study details epigenetic reprogramming dynamics early mammalian embryos also suggests diagnostic potential future therapeutic applications
