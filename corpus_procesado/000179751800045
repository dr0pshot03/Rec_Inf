large clusters co-expressed genes drosophila genome
clustering co-expressed non-homologous genes chromosomes implies co-regulation lower eukaryotes coexpressed genes often found pairs clustering genes share aspects transcriptional regulation also reported higher eukaryotes advance understanding mode coordinated gene regulation multicellular organisms performed genome-wide analysis chromosomal distribution co-expressed genes drosophila identified total testes-specific genes one-third clustered chromosomes number clusters three genes much higher expected chance observed similar trend genes upregulated embryo adult head although expression pattern individual genes predicted basis chromosomal position alone data suggest prevalent mechanism transcriptional co-regulation higher eukaryotes operates extensive chromatin domains comprise multiple genes
