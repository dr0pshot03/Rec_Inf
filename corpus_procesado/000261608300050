role escrt system cell division archaea
archaea prokaryotic organisms lack endomembrane structures however number hyperthermophilic members kingdom crenarchaea including members sulfolobus genus encode homologs eukaryotic endosomal sorting system components vps4 escrt iii endosomal sorting complex required transport iii found sulfolobus escrt iii vps4 homologs underwent regulation expression cell cycle proteins interacted established structural basis interaction furthermore proteins specifically localized mid cell cell division overexpression catalytically inactive mutant vps4 sulfolobus resulted accumulation enlarged cells indicative failed cell division thus archaeal escrt system plays key role cell division
