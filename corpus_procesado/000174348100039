cbl-cin85-endophilin complex mediates ligand-induced downregulation egf receptors
cbl multi-adaptor protein involved ligand-induced down-regulation receptor tyrosine kinases thought cbl-mediated ubiquitination active receptors essential receptor degradation cessation receptor-induced signal transduction- demonstrate cbl additionally regulates epidermal growth factor egf receptor endocytosis cbl rapidly recruits cin85 cbl-interacting protein 85k ref endophilins regulatory components clathrin-coated vesicles- form complex activated egf receptors thus controlling receptor internalization cin85 constitutively associated endophilins whereas cin85 binding distal carboxy terminus cbl increased egf stimulation inhibition interactions sufficient block egf receptor internalization delay receptor degradation enhance egf-induced gene transcription without perturbing cbl-directed receptor ubiquitination thus evolutionary divergent c terminus cbl uses mechanism functionally separable ubiquitin ligase activity cbl mediate ligand-dependent down-regulation receptor tyrosine kinases
