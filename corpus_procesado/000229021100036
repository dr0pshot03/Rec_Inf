nonlinear elasticity biological gels
mechanical properties soft biological tissues essential physiological function easily duplicated synthetic materials unlike simple polymer gels many biological materials including blood vessels mesentery tissue lung parenchyma cornea blood clots stiffen strained thereby preventing large deformations threaten tissue integrity molecular structures design principles responsible nonlinear elasticity unknown report molecular theory accounts strain-stiffening range molecularly distinct gels formed cytoskeletal extracellular proteins reveals universal stress strain relations low intermediate strains input theory force extension curve individual semi-flexible filaments assumptions biological networks composed filaments homogeneous isotropic strain uniformly theory shows systems filamentous proteins arranged open crosslinked mesh invariably stiffen low strains without requiring specific architecture multiple elements different intrinsic stiffness
