anciently asexual bdelloid rotifers escape lethal fungal parasites drying blowing away 
asexuality major theoretical advantages sexual reproduction important evolutionary puzzle therefore exclusively asexual metazoan lineages rarely endure red queen hypothesis posits asexuality rapidly extinguished relentlessly coevolving parasites pathogens long-lasting asexual lineage must unusual alternative mechanisms deal biotic enemies bdelloid rotifers freshwater invertebrates abandoned sexual reproduction millions years ago show cultured populations bdelloids can rid deadly fungal parasite complete desiccation anhydrobiosis disperse wind establish new populations absence red queen models spatiotemporal escape can decouple protect asexuals coevolving enemies thus results may help explain persistence anciently asexual bdelloidea
