little solar wind enters venus atmosphere solar minimum
venus significant internal magnetic field allows solar wind interact directly atmosphere field induced interaction partially shields atmosphere knowledge effective shield solar minimum current knowledge solar wind interaction venus derived measurements solar maximum- bow shock close planet meaning possible solar wind absorbed atmosphere contribute evolution atmosphere report magnetic field measurements venus express spacecraft plasma environment surrounding venus bow shock low solar activity conditions seems position expected complete deflection magnetized ionosphere therefore little solar wind enters venus ionosphere even solar minimum
