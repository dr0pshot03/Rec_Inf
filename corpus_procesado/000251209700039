little solar wind enters venus atmosphere solar minimum 
venus significant internal magnetic field1 allows solar wind interact directly atmosphere23 field induced interaction partially shields atmosphere knowledge effective shield solar minimum current knowledge solar wind interaction venus derived measurements solar maximum4- bow shock close planet meaning possible solar wind absorbed atmosphere contribute evolution atmosphere89 report magnetic field measurements venus express spacecraft4 plasma environment surrounding venus bow shock low solar activity conditions seems position expected complete deflection magnetized ionosphere10 therefore little solar wind enters venus ionosphere even solar minimum
