subdiffraction multicolor imaging nuclear periphery 3d structured illumination microscopy
fluorescence light microscopy allows multicolor visualization cellular components high specificity utility recently constrained intrinsic limit spatial resolution applied three dimensional structured illumination microscopy 3d sim circumvent limit study mammalian nucleus simultaneously imaging chromatin nuclear lamina nuclear pore complex npc observed several features escape detection conventional microscopy resolve single npcs colocalized channels lamin network peripheral heterochromatin differentially localize distinct npc components detect double layered invaginations nuclear envelope prophase previously seen electron microscopy multicolor 3d sim opens new facile possibilities analyze subcellular structures beyond diffraction limit emitted light
