use transit timing detect terrestrial-mass extrasolar planets
future surveys transiting extrasolar planets expected detect hundreds jovian-mass planets tens terrestria-mass planets many newly discovered planets intervals successive transits will measured accuracy minutes show timing measurements will allow detection additional planets system necessarily transiting gravitational interaction transiting planet transit-time variations depend mass additional planets cases terrestrial-mass planets will produce measurable effect systems two planets seen transit density planets can determined without radial-velocity observations
