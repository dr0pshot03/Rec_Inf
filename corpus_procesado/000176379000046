deciphering cross-talk implantation: advances challenges
implantation involves series steps leading effective reciprocal signaling blastocyst uterus except restricted period ovarian hormones induce uterine receptive phase uterus unfavorable environment blastocyst implantation species-specific variations implantation strategies exist differences preclude formulation unifying theme molecular basis event however increased understanding mammalian implantation gained use mouse model review summarizes recognized signaling cascades new research mammalian implantation based primarily available genetic molecular evidence implantation studies mouse although identification new molecules associated implantation various species provides valuable insight important questions remain regarding common molecular mechanisms govern process understanding mechanisms implantation promises help alleviate infertility enhance fetal health improve contraceptive design
