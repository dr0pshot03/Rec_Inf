high-affinity conformation hsp90 confers tumour selectivity hsp90 inhibitors
heat shock protein hsp90 molecular chaperone plays key role conformational maturation oncogenic signalling proteins including her-/erbb2 akt raf- bcr-abl mutated p53- hsp90 inhibitors bind hsp90 induce proteasomal degradation hsp90 client proteins- although hsp90 highly expressed cells hsp90 inhibitors selectively kill cancer cells compared normal cells hsp90 inhibitor allylaminogeldanamycin -aag currently phase clinical trials however molecular basis tumour selectivity hsp90 inhibitors unknown report hsp90 derived tumour cells fold higher binding affinity aag hsp90 normal cells tumour hsp90 present entirely multi-chaperone complexes high atpase activity whereas hsp90 normal tissues latent uncomplexed state vitro reconstitution chaperone complexes hsp90 resulted increased binding affinity aag increased atpase activity results suggest tumour cells contain hsp90 complexes activated high-affinity conformation facilitates malignant progression may represent unique target cancer therapeutics
