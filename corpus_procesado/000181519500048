modulating sphingolipid biosynthetic pathway rescues photoreceptor degeneration
mutations proteins drosophila phototransduction cascade prototypic guanine nucleotide-binding protein-coupled receptor signaling system lead retinal degeneration used models understand human degenerative disorders modulating sphingolipid biosynthetic pathway rescued retinal degeneration drosophila mutants targeted expression drosophila neutral ceramidase rescued retinal degeneration arrestin phospholipase c mutants decreasing flux de novo sphingolipid biosynthetic pathway also suppressed degeneration mutants genetic backgrounds modulated endocytic machinery suppressed defects dynamin mutant suppression degeneration arrestin mutant flies expressing ceramidase correlated decrease ceramide levels thus enzymes sphingolipid metabolism may suitable targets therapeutic management retinal degeneration
