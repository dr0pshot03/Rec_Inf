stereoinversion tertiary alcohols tertiary-alkyl isonitriles amines
sn reaction bimolecular nucleophilic substitution well-known chemical transformation can used join two smaller molecules together larger molecule exchange one functional group another sn reaction proceeds predictable manner: substitution occurs inversion stereochemistry resulting backside attack electrophilic carbon nucleophile significant limitation sn reaction intolerance tertiary carbon atoms: whereas primary secondary alcohols viable precursor substrates tertiary alcohols derivatives usually either fail react produce stereochemical mixtures products- report stereochemical inversion chiral tertiary alcohols nitrogenous nucleophile facilitated lewis-acid-catalysed solvolysis method chemoselective secondary primary alcohols thereby complementing selectivity sn reaction furthermore method carbon-nitrogen bond formation mimics putative biosynthetic step synthesis marine terpenoids enables preparation corresponding terrestrial terpenes expect general attributes methodology will allow chiral tertiary alcohols considered viable substrates stereoinversion reactions
