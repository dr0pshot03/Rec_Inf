second class chemosensory receptors olfactory epithelium
mammalian olfactory system detects chemicals sensed odours well social cues stimulate innate responses odorants detected nasal olfactory epithelium odorant receptor family whose members allow discrimination myriad odorants report discovery second family receptors mouse olfactory epithelium genes encoding receptors called trace amine associated receptors taars present human mouse fish like odorant receptors individual mouse taars expressed unique subsets neurons dispersed epithelium notably least three mouse taars recognize volatile amines found urine: one detects compound linked stress whereas two detect compounds enriched male versus female urine one reportedly pheromone evolutionary conservation taar family suggests chemosensory function distinct odorant receptors ligands identified taars thus far suggest function associated detection social cues
