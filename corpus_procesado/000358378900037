parent-progeny sequencing indicates higher mutation rates heterozygotes
mutation rates vary within genomes causes remain unclear many prior inferences rely methods assume absence selection potentially leading artefactual results call mutation events directly using parent-offspring sequencing strategy focusing arabidopsis using rice honey bee replication show mutation rates higher heterozygotes proximity crossover events correlation recombination rate intraspecific diversity part owing higher mutation rate domains high recombination/ diversity implicating diversity per se cause find similar -fold higher mutation rate heterozygotes homozygotes mutations occurring closer proximity heterozygous sites expected chance genome patchwork heterozygous homozygous domains mutations occur disproportionately often heterozygous domains segregating mutations predispose higher local mutation rate clusters genes dominantly purifying selection commonly homozygous balancing selection commonly heterozygous might low high mutation rates respectively results consistent ten times higher mutation rate pathogen resistance genes expected positive balancing selection consequently necessarily need evoke extremely weak selection mutation rate explain mutational hot cold spots might correspond regions positive/balancing purifying selection respectively
