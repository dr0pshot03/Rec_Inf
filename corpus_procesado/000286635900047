high-gain backward lasing air 
compelling need standoff detection hazardous gases vapor indicators explosives motivated development remotely pumped high-gain air laser produces lasing backward direction can sample air beam returns demonstrate high gain can achieved near-infrared region pumping focused ultraviolet laser pumping mechanism simultaneous resonant two-photon dissociation molecular oxygen resonant two-photon pumping atomic oxygen fragments high gain millimeter-length focal zone leads equally strong lasing forward backward directions backward amplification achieved use earlier laser spark dissociation low-divergence backward air lasing provides possibilities remote detection
