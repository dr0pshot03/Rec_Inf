restricted epigenetic inheritance h3k9 methylation 
posttranslational histone modifications believed allow epigenetic transmission distinct chromatin states independently associated dna sequences histone h3 lysine h3k9 methylation essential heterochromatin formation however demonstration epigenetic heritability lacking fission yeast single h3k9 methyltransferase clr4 directs h3k9 methylation heterochromatin using releasable tethered clr4 reveals active process rapidly erases h3k9 methylation tethering sites wild-type cells however inactivation putative histone demethylase epe1 allows h3k9 methylation silent chromatin maintenance tethering site many mitotic divisions transgenerationally throughmeiosis release tethered clr4 thus h3k9 methylation heritable epigenetic mark whose transmission usually countered active removal prevents unauthorized inheritance heterochromatin
