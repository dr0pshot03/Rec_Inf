long-lived relativistic electron storage ring embedded earths outer van allen belt
since discovery years ago earths van allen radiation belts considered consist two distinct zones trapped highly energetic charged particles outer zone composed predominantly megaelectron volt mev electrons wax wane intensity time scales ranging hours days depending primarily external forcing solar wind spatially separated inner zone composed commingled high-energy electrons energetic positive ions mostly protons latter stable intensity levels years decades situ energy-specific temporally resolved spacecraft observations reveal isolated third ring torus high-energy > mev electrons formed september persisted largely unchanged geocentric radial range similar earth radii weeks disrupted virtually annihilated powerful interplanetary shock wave passage
