molecular logic planarian regeneration along anterior-posterior axis 
planarian dugesia japonica can regenerate complete individual head trunk tail fragment via activation somatic pluripotent stem cells12 century ago thomas hunt morgan attempted explain extraordinary regenerative ability planarians positing two opposing morphogenetic gradients formative "head stuff" "tail stuff" along anterior-posterior axis34 however morgans hypothesis remains open debate show extracellular signal-related kinase erk wnt/beta-catenin signalling pathways establish solid framework planarian regeneration data suggest erk signalling forms spatial gradient anterior region regeneration fibroblast growth factor receptor-like gene nou-darake5 serves output erk signalling differentiating head posteriorly biased beta-catenin activity6- negatively regulate erk signalling along anterior-posterior axis distinct manners thereby posteriorize regenerating tissues outside head region reconstruct complete head-to-tail axis basis knowledge d japonica proposed beta-catenin signalling responsible lack head-regenerative ability tail fragments planarian phagocata kawakatsui confirmation thereof supports notion posterior beta-catenin signalling negatively modulates erk signalling involved anteriorization across planarian species findings suggest erk signalling pivotal role triggering globally dynamic differentiation stem cells head-to-tail sequence default program promotes head tissue specification absence posteriorizing signals thus confirmed broad outline morgans hypothesis refined basis proposed default property planarian stem cells
