partitioning recent greenland mass loss 
mass budget calculations validated satellite gravity observations [from gravity recovery climate experiment grace satellites] enable us quantify individual components recent greenland mass loss total - mass loss similar gigatons equivalent millimeters per year global sea level rise equally split surface processes runoff precipitation ice dynamics without moderating effects increased snowfall refreezing post- greenland ice sheet mass losses % higher since high summer melt rates increased greenland ice sheet mass loss gigatons per year millimeters per year equivalent sea level rise seasonal cycle surface mass balance fully accounts detrended grace mass variations confirming insignificant subannual variation ice sheet discharge
