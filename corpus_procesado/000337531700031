electronic quantum eraser 
quantum eraser device illustrates quantum principle complementarity shows dephased system can regain lost quantum behavior erasing "which-path" information already obtained thus far quantum erasers constructed predominantly optical systems present realization quantum eraser mesoscopic electronic device use interacting electrons instead noninteracting photons allows control extracted information smooth variation degree quantum erasure demonstrated system can serve first step toward variety complex setups
