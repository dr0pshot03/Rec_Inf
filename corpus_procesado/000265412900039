impact changes diffuse radiation global land carbon sink 
plant photosynthesis tends increase irradiance however recent theoretical observational studies demonstrated photosynthesis also efficient diffuse light conditions1- changes cloud cover atmospheric aerosol loadings arising either volcanic anthropogenic emissions alter total photosynthetically active radiation reaching surface fraction radiation diffuse uncertain overall effects global plant productivity land carbon sink estimate impact variations diffuse fraction land carbon sink using global model modified account effects variations direct diffuse radiation canopy photosynthesis estimate variations diffuse fraction associated largely global dimming period6- enhanced land carbon sink approximately one-quarter however climate mitigation scenario twenty-first century sulphate aerosols decline atmospheric co2 stabilized diffuse-radiation fertilization effect declines rapidly near zero end twenty-first century
