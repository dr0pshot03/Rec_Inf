impenetrable barrier ultrarelativistic electrons van allen radiation belts 
early observations12 indicated earths van allen radiation belts separated inner zone dominated high-energy protons outer zone dominated high-energy electrons subsequent studies34 showed electrons moderate energy less one megaelectronvolt often populate zones deep slot region largely devoid particles region dense cold plasma around earth known plasmasphere outer boundary called plasmapause two-belt radiation structure explained arising strong electron interactions plasmaspheric hiss just inside plasmapause boundary5 inner edge outer radiation zone corresponding minimum plasmapause location6 recent observations revealed unexpected radiation belt morphology78 especially ultrarelativistic kinetic energies910 five megaelectronvolts analyse extended data set reveals exceedingly sharp inner boundary ultrarelativistic electrons additional concurrently measured data11 reveal barrier inward electron radial transport arise physical boundary within earths intrinsic magnetic field inward radial diffusion unlikely inhibited scattering electromagnetic transmitter wave fields rather suggest exceptionally slow natural inward radial diffusion combined weak persistent wave-particle pitch angle scattering deep inside earths plasmasphere can combine create almost impenetrable barrier energetic van allen belt electrons migrate
