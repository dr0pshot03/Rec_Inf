magnetically focused molecular beam ortho-water 
like dihydrogen water exists two spin isomers ortho para nuclear magnetic moments hydrogen atoms either parallel antiparallel ratio two spin isomers physical properties play important role wide variety research fields ranging astrophysics nuclear magnetic resonance nmr unlike ortho para h- however two water isomers remain challenging separate consequence little currently known different physical properties report formation magnetically focused molecular beam ortho-water beam formed also particular spin projection thus presence holding magnetic fields water molecules hyperpolarized laying foundation ultrasensitive nmr experiments future
