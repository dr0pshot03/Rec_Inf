stathmin-tubulin interaction gradients motile mitotic cells
spatial organization microtubule cytoskeleton thought directed steady-state activity gradients diffusible regulatory molecules visualized intracellular gradients monitoring interaction tubulin regulator microtubule dynamics stathmin using fluorescence resonance energy transfer fret biosensor gradients observed interphase motile membrane protrusions mitosis around chromosomes suggests similar mechanism may contribute creation polarized microtubule structures interaction patterns likely reflect phosphorylation stathmin areas
