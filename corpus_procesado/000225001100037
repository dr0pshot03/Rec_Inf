hysteretic adsorption desorption hydrogen nanoporous metal-organic frameworks 
adsorption desorption hydrogen nanoporous materials activated carbon usually fully reversible prepared nanoporous metal-organic framework materials flexible linkers pore openings characterized static structures appear small allow h- pass observe hysteresis adsorption desorption kinetics supercritical temperature h- reflects dynamical opening "windows" pores behavior allow h- adsorbed high pressures stored lower pressures
