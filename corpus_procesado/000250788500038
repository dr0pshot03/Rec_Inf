one-dimensional fast migration vacancy clusters metals
migration point defects example crystal lattice vacancies self-interstitial atoms sias typically occurs three-dimensional random walk crystalline solids however vacancies sias agglomerate form planar clusters migration mode may change observed nanometer-sized clusters vacancies exhibiting one-dimensional 1d fast migration 1d migration transported vacancy cluster containing several hundred vacancies mobility higher single vacancy random walk mobility comparable single sia random walk moreover found 1d migration may key physical mechanism self-organization nanometer-sized sessile vacancy cluster stacking fault tetrahedron arrays harnessing 1d migration mode may enable new control defect microstructures effective defect removal introduction ordered nanostructures materials including semiconductors
