movement intention parietal cortex stimulation humans 
parietal premotor cortex regions serious contenders bringing motor intentions motor responses awareness used electrical stimulation seven patients undergoing awake brain surgery stimulating right inferior parietal regions triggered strong intention desire move contralateral hand arm foot whereas stimulating left inferior parietal region provoked intention move lips talk stimulation intensity increased parietal areas participants believed really performed movements although electromyographic activity detected stimulation premotor region triggered overt mouth contralateral limb movements yet patients firmly denied moved conscious intention motor awareness thus arise increased parietal activity movement execution
