structures parb bound dna reveal mechanism partition complex formation 
faithful inheritance genetic information essential organisms requires accurate dna partition segregation cell division prokaryotes partition mediated par systems p1 plasmid system escherichia coli prototype comprising partition site two proteins para parb12 form partition complex necessary segregation p1 parb must recognize complicated arrangement a-box b-box dna motifs located opposite ends sharply bent pars partition site similar bp refs - describe structures parb bound partition sites parb forms asymmetric dimer extended amino-terminal hth helix-turn-helix domains contact a-boxes two hth domains emanate dimerized dna-binding module composed six-stranded beta-sheet coiled-coil binds b-boxes strikingly individual dna-binding modules rotate freely flexible linker enabling contact several arrangements b-boxes notably dna-binding element binds thus bridges adjacent dna duplexes unique structural features parb explain protein can bind complex arrays b-box elements adjacent dna arms looped partition site
