modulation cell adhesion motility immune system myo1f 
although class myosins known play wide range roles physiological function long-tailed class myosins vertebrates remains elusive demonstrated one proteins myo1f expressed predominantly mammalian immune system cells myo1f-deficient mice exhibited abnormally increased adhesion reduced motility resulting augmented exocytosis beta integrin containing granules also cortical actin co-localizes myo1f reduced myo1f-deficient cells vivo myo1f-deficient mice showed increased susceptibility infection listeria monocytogenes impaired neutrophil response thus myo1f directs immune cell motility innate host defense infection
