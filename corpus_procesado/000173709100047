genome shuffling leads rapid phenotypic improvement bacteria 
millennia selective breeding basis biparental mating led successful improvement plants animals meet societal needs molecular level dna shuffling mimics yet accelerates evolutionary processes allows breeding improvement individual genes subgenomic dna fragments describe whole-genome shuffling process combines advantage multi-parental crossing allowed dna shuffling recombination entire genomes normally associated conventional breeding show recursive genomic recombination within population bacteria can efficiently generate combinatorial libraries new strains applied population phenotypically selected bacteria many new strains show marked improvements selected phenotype demonstrate use approach rapid improvement tylosin production streptomyces fradiae approach potential facilitate cell metabolic engineering provide non-recombinant alternative rapid production improved organisms
