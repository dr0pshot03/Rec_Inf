erosion organic carbon arctic geological carbon dioxide sink 
soils northern high latitudes store carbon millennial timescales thousands years contain approximately double carbon stock atmosphere- warming associated permafrost thaw can expose soil organic carbon result mineralization carbon dioxide co2 release- however soil organic carbon may eroded transferred rivers- escapes degradation river transport buried marine sediments can contribute longer-term ten thousand years geological co2 sink- despite recognition erosional flux fate particulate organic carbon poc large rivers high latitudes remains poorly constrained quantify source poc mackenzie river main sediment supplier arctic ocean assess flux fate combine measurements radiocarbon stable carbon isotopes element ratios correct rock-derived poc10 samples reveal eroded biospheric poc resided basin millennia mean radiocarbon age +/ years much older poc large tropical rivers measured biospheric poc content variability annual sediment yield calculate biospheric poc flux -+ teragrams carbon per year mackenzie river three times co2 drawdown silicate weathering basin offshore find evidence efficient terrestrial organic carbon burial holocene period suggesting erosion organic carbon-rich high-latitude soils may result important geological co2 sink
