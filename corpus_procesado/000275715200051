ckamp44: brain-specific protein attenuating short-term synaptic plasticity dentate gyrus 
ckamp44 identified proteomic approach brain-specific type transmembrane protein associates ampa receptors synaptic spines ckamp44 expressed xenopus oocytes reduced glua1 a2-mediated steady-state currents affect kainate-or n-methyl-d-aspartate nmda receptor-mediated currents mouse hippocampal ca1 pyramidal neurons expressed ckamp44 low abundance overexpression ckamp44 led stronger faster ampa receptor desensitization slower recovery desensitization reduction paired-pulse ratio ampa currents contrast dentate gyrus granule cells exhibited strong ckamp44 expression ckamp44 knockout increased paired-pulse ratio ampa currents lateral medial perforant path-granule cell synapses ckamp44 thus modulates short-term plasticity specific excitatory synapses
