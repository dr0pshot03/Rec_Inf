functional role transposases large eukaryotic genome
despite comprising much eukaryotic genome transposons active usually confer benefit host exaggerated process genome rearrangement oxytricha trifallax destroys % germline genome development includes elimination transposon dna show germline-limited transposase genes play key roles process genome-wide dna excision suggests transposases function large eukaryotic genomes containing thousands active transposons show transposase gene expression occurs germline-soma differentiation silencing transposase rna interference leads abnormal dna rearrangement offspring study suggests new important role oxytricha large portion genomic dna previously thought junk
