craniofacial development hagfishes evolution vertebrates 
cyclostomes living jawless vertebrates including hagfishes lampreys represent basal lineage vertebrates although monophyly cyclostomes supported recent molecular analyses phenotypic traits hagfishes especially lack vertebrate-defining features reported endodermal origin adenohypophysis interpreted hagfishes exhibiting ancestral state vertebrates furthermore adult anatomy hagfishes compared easily lampreys describe craniofacial development series staged hagfish embryos shows adenohypophysis arises ectodermally consistent molecular phylogenetic data finding also allowed us identify pan-cyclostome pattern one shared jawed vertebrates comparative analyses indicated many hagfish-specific traits can explained changes secondarily introduced hagfish lineage also propose possibility pan-cyclostome pattern may reflect ancestral programme craniofacial development living vertebrates
