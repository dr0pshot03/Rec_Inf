insect neuropeptide ptth activates receptor tyrosine kinase torso initiate metamorphosis 
holometabolous insects undergo complete metamorphosis become sexually mature adults metamorphosis initiated brain-derived prothoracicotropic hormone ptth stimulates production molting hormone ecdysone via incompletely defined signaling pathway demonstrate torso receptor tyrosine kinase regulates embryonic terminal cell fate drosophila ptth receptor trunk embryonic torso ligand related ptth ectopic expression ptth embryo partially rescues trunk mutants larvae torso expressed specifically prothoracic gland pg loss phenocopies removal ptth activation torso ptth stimulates extracellular signal-regulated kinase erk phosphorylation loss erk pg phenocopies loss ptth torso conclude ptth initiates metamorphosis activation torso/erk pathway
