gate control mechanical itch subpopulation spinal cord interneurons 
light mechanical stimulation hairy skin can induce form itch known mechanical itch itch sensation normally suppressed inputs mechanoreceptors however many forms chronic itch including alloknesis gating mechanism lost demonstrate population spinal inhibitory interneurons defined expression neuropeptide y::cre npy::cre act gate mechanical itch mice dorsal npy::cre-derived neurons selectively ablated silenced develop mechanical itch without increase sensitivity chemical itch pain chronic itch state histamine-independent transmitted independently neurons express gastrin-releasing peptide receptor thus studies reveal dedicated spinal cord inhibitory pathway gates transmission mechanical itch
