genome-wide analysis notch signalling drosophila transgenic rnai 
genome-wide rna interference rnai screens identified near-complete sets genes involved cellular processes however methodology yet used study complex developmental processes tissue-specific manner report use library drosophila strains expressing inducible hairpin rnai constructs study notch signalling pathway external sensory organ development assigned putative loss-of-function phenotypes % protein-coding drosophila genes using secondary assays identified new genes involved asymmetric cell division novel genes regulating notch signalling pathway integrating phenotypic results protein interaction data constructed genome-wide functionally validated interaction network governing notch signalling asymmetric cell division used clustering algorithms identify nuclear import pathways cop9 signallosome notch regulators results show complex developmental processes can analysed genome-wide level provide unique resource functional annotation drosophila genome
