independent cellular processes hippocampal memory consolidation reconsolidation
idea new memories undergo time-dependent consolidation process acquisition received considerable experimental support controversial demonstration established memories recalled become labile sensitive disruption requiring reconsolidation become permanent infusing antisense oligodeoxynucleotides hippocampus rats show consolidation reconsolidation doubly dissociable component processes memory consolidation involves brain-derived neurotrophic factor bdnf transcription factor zif268 whereas reconsolidation recruits zif268 bdnf findings confirm requirement bdnf specifically memory consolidation also resolve role zif268 brain plasticity learning memory
