type vi secretion requires dynamic contractile phage tail-like structure
type vi secretion systems bacterial virulence-associated nanomachines composed proteins evolutionarily related components bacteriophage tails show protein secretion type vi secretion system vibrio cholerae requires action dynamic intracellular tubular structure structurally functionally homologous contractile phage tail sheath time-lapse fluorescence light microscopy reveals sheaths type vi secretion system cycle assembly quick contraction disassembly re-assembly whole-cell electron cryotomography shows sheaths appear long tubular structures either extended contracted conformations connected inner membrane distinct basal structure data support model contraction type vi secretion system sheath provides energy needed translocate proteins effector cells adjacent target cells
