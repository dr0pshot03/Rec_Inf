spatial synchronization vole population dynamics predatory birds 
northern vole populations exhibit large-scale spatially synchronous population dynamics cases population synchrony provide excellent opportunities distinguishing local intrinsic regional extrinsic mechanisms population regulation analyses large-scale survey data theoretical modelling- indicated several plausible synchronizing mechanisms difficult however determine important one without detailed data local demographic processes combine results two field studies southeastern norway-one identifies local demographic mechanisms landscape-level annual synchrony among enclosed experimental populations examines region-level multi-annual synchrony open natural populations despite fences eliminating predatory mammals vole dispersal growth rates experimental populations synchronized moreover perfectly linked vole abundance region fates radio-marked voles showed bird predation synchronizing mechanism higher frequency risky dispersal movements slowly growing populations appeared accelerate predation rate thus dispersal may induce feedback-loop predation population growth enhances synchrony
