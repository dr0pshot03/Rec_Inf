lattice light-sheet microscopy: imaging molecules embryos high spatiotemporal resolution 
although fluorescence microscopy provides crucial window physiology living specimens many biological processes fragile small occur rapidly see clearly existing tools crafted ultrathin light sheets two-dimensional optical lattices allowed us image three-dimensional 3d dynamics hundreds volumes often subsecond intervals diffraction limit beyond applied systems spanning four orders magnitude space time including diffusion single transcription factor molecules stem cell spheroids dynamic instability mitotic microtubules immunological synapse neutrophil motility 3d matrix embryogenesis caenorhabditis elegans drosophila melanogaster results provide visceral reminder beauty complexity living systems
