hydrodynamic trail-following harbor seals phoca vitulina
marine mammals often forage dark turbid waters whereas dolphins use echolocation conditions pinnipeds apparently lack sensory ability seals hunting dark one source sensory information may consist fish-generated water movements seals can detect highly sensitive whiskers water movements wake fishes persist several minutes show blindfolded seals can use whiskers detect accurately follow hydrodynamic trails generated miniature submarine shows hydrodynamic information can used long-distance prey location
