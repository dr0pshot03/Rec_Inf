open form syntaxin bypasses requirement unc vesicle priming 
priming step synaptic vesicle exocytosis thought require formation snare complex comprises proteins synaptobrevin snap syntaxin- solution syntaxin adopts default closed configuration incompatible formation snare complex specifically amino terminus syntaxin binds snare motif occludes interactions snare proteins n terminus syntaxin also binds presynaptic protein unc ref studies mouse drosophila caenorhabditis elegans suggest unc functions post-docking step exocytosis likely synaptic vesicle priming- therefore unc binding n terminus syntaxin may promote open configuration syntaxin test model engineered mutations c elegans syntaxin cause protein adopt open configuration constitutively demonstrate open form syntaxin can bypass requirement unc synaptic vesicle priming thus likely unc primes synaptic vesicles fusion promoting open configuration syntaxin
