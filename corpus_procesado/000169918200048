open form syntaxin bypasses requirement unc- vesicle priming 
priming step synaptic vesicle exocytosis thought require formation snare complex comprises proteins synaptobrevin snap- syntaxin1- solution syntaxin adopts default closed configuration incompatible formation snare complex4 specifically amino terminus syntaxin binds snare motif occludes interactions snare proteins n terminus syntaxin also binds presynaptic protein unc- ref studies mouse drosophila caenorhabditis elegans suggest unc- functions post-docking step exocytosis likely synaptic vesicle priming6- therefore unc- binding n terminus syntaxin may promote open configuration syntaxin9 test model engineered mutations c elegans syntaxin cause protein adopt open configuration constitutively4 demonstrate open form syntaxin can bypass requirement unc- synaptic vesicle priming thus likely unc- primes synaptic vesicles fusion promoting open configuration syntaxin
