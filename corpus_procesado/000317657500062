neural marker perceptual consciousness infants 
infants sophisticated behavioral cognitive repertoire suggestive capacity conscious reflection yet demonstrating conscious access infants remains challenging mainly report thoughts circumvent problem studied whether electrophysiological signature consciousness found adults corresponding late nonlinear cortical response [similar milliseconds ms] brief pictures already exists infants recorded event-related potentials - - -month-old infants n viewed masked faces various levels visibility age groups found late slow wave showing nonlinear profile expected perceptual thresholds however late component shifted weak delayed response -month-olds starting around ms sustained faster response older infants around ms results reveal brain mechanisms underlying threshold conscious perception already present infancy undergo slow acceleration development
