structure amp-pnp-bound vitamin b transporter btucd-f 
atp-binding cassette abc transporter btucd mediates uptake vitamin b across inner membrane escherichia coli previous structures shown conformations apo states transport mechanism remained unclear report angstrom crystal structure transporter-binding protein complex btucd-btuf btucd-f trapped beta-gamma-imidoadenosine -phosphate amp-pnp-bound intermediate state although abc domains btud subunits form expected closed sandwich dimer membrane-spanning btuc subunits adopt new conformation central translocation pathway sealed previously unrecognized cytoplasmic gate fully enclosed cavity thus formed approximately halfway across membrane large enough accommodate vitamin b molecule radioligand trapping showed liposome-reconstituted btucd-f indeed contains bound b presence amp-pnp combination engineered disulphide crosslinking functional assays data suggest unexpected peristaltic transport mechanism distinct observed abc transporters
