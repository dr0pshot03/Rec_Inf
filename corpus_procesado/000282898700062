laser cooling diatomic molecule 
roughly three decades since laser cooling techniques produced ultracold atoms1- leading rapid advances wide array fields laser cooling yet extended molecules complex internal structure however complexity makes molecules potentially useful wide range applications4 example heteronuclear molecules possess permanent electric dipole moments lead long-range tunable anisotropic dipole-dipole interactions combination dipole-dipole interaction precise control molecular degrees freedom possible ultracold temperatures makes ultracold molecules attractive candidates use quantum simulations condensed-matter systems5 quantum computation6 also ultracold molecules provide unique opportunities studying chemical dynamics78 tests fundamental symmetries9- experimentally demonstrate laser cooling polar molecule strontium monofluoride srf using optical cycling scheme requiring three lasers12 observed sisyphus doppler cooling forces reduce transverse temperature srf molecular beam substantially millikelvin less present technique producing ultracold molecules bind together ultracold alkali atoms feshbach resonance13 photoassociation14 however proposed applications ultracold molecules require variety molecular energy-level structures example unpaired electronic spin591115 omega doublets16 method provides alternative route ultracold molecules particular bridges gap ultracold submillikelvin temperatures similar -k temperatures attainable directly cooled molecules example cryogenic buffer-gas cooling17 decelerated supersonic beams18 ultimately technique allow production large samples molecules ultracold temperatures species chemically distinct bialkalis
