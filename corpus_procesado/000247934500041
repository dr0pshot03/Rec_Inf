biodiversity ecosystem multifunctionality 
biodiversity loss can affect ecosystem functions services1- individual ecosystem functions generally show positive asymptotic relationship increasing biodiversity suggesting species redundant5- however ecosystems managed conserved multiple functions may require greater biodiversity present analysis published data grassland biodiversity experiments9- show ecosystem multifunctionality require greater numbers species analysed ecosystem function alone identify species desirable effects calculated number species positive effects possible combinations functions results show appreciable differences sets species influencing different ecosystem functions average proportional overlap consequently ecosystem processes included analysis species found affect overall functioning specifically analysed experiments positive saturating relationship number ecosystem processes considered number species influencing overall functioning conclude different species often influence different functions studies focusing individual processes isolation will underestimate levels biodiversity required maintain multifunctional ecosystems
