ongoing vivo experience triggers synaptic metaplasticity neocortex 
vivo experience can occlude subsequent induction long term potentiation enhance long term depression synaptic responses although reduced capacity synaptic strengthening may function prevent excessive excitation effect paradoxically implies continued experience training improve may even degrade neural representations mice examined effect ongoing whisker stimulation synaptic strengthening layer / synapses barrel cortex although n methyl d aspartate receptors required initiate strengthening subsequently suppressed potentiation synapses vitro vivo despite transition synaptic strengthening continued additional sensory activity instead required activation metabotropic glutamate receptors suggesting mechanism continued experience can result increasing synaptic strength time
