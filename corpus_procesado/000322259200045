general strategy chemoenzymatic synthesis asymmetrically branched n-glycans
systematic efficient means producing diverse libraries asymmetrically branched n-glycans needed investigate specificities biology glycan-binding proteins end describe core pentasaccharide potential branching positions modified orthogonal protecting groups allow selective attachment specific saccharide moieties chemical glycosylation appendages selected antenna resulting deprotected compounds selectively extended glycosyltransferases give libraries asymmetrical multi-antennary glycans power methodology demonstrated preparation series complex oligosaccharides printed microarrays screened binding lectins influenza-virus hemagglutinins showed recognition modulated presentation minimal epitopes context complex n-glycans
