hippocampal place cells model system brain constructs cognitive representations representations support complex behavior teaming memory however lack detailed knowledge properties hippocampal afferents recorded multiple single units hippocampus medial lateral entorhinal areas behaving rats although many medial entorhinal neurons highly specific place fields lateral entorhinal neurons displayed weak spatial specificity finding demonstrates fundamental dissociation information conveyed hippocampus major input streams spatial information represented medial nonspatial information represented lateral entorhinal cortex
