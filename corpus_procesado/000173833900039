observation stimulated emission direct three-photon excitation
multiphoton processes predicted theoretically long time considered mainly academic interest view changed shown two-photon absorption process quadratic dependence excitation intensity produce spatially confined excitation useful three-dimensional data storage imaging two-photon absorption received considerable attention recently development highly efficient two-photon-sensitive materials leading numerous technological applications- successes created interest exploring applications based three-photon excitations three-photon process longer excitation wavelength common optical communications can used also cubic dependence three-photon process input light intensity provides stronger spatial confinement higher contrast imaging can obtained report observation highly directional up-converted stimulated emission amplified spontaneous emission produced organic chromophore solution strong simultaneous three-photon absorption mum achievement suggests opportunities three-photon process frequency-upconversion lasing short-pulse optical communications emerging field biophotonics
