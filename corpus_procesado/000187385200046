dual activation drosophila toll pathway two pattern recognition receptors
toll-dependent defense gram-positive bacterial infections drosophila mediated peptidoglycan recognition protein sapgrp-sa mutation termed osiris disrupts gram-negative binding protein gnbp1 gene leads compromised survival mutant flies gram-positive infections fungal gram-negative bacterial challenge results demonstrate gnbp1 pgrp-sa can jointly activate toll pathway potential combination distinct proteins mediate detection infectious nonself fly will refine concept pattern recognition insects
