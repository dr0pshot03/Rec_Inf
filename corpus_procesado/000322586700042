future species climate change: resilience decline 
climates change across already stressed ecosystems doubt species will affected extent will vulnerable remain uncertain fossil record suggests species persisted past climate change whereas forecasts future impacts predict large-scale range reduction extinction many species altered range limits phenotypes 20th-century climate change responses highly variable proximate causes species decline relative resilience remain largely obscure; however recent examples climate-associated species decline can help guide current management parallel ongoing research
