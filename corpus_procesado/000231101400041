probing ultrafast charge translocation photoexcited retinal bacteriorhodopsin
ultrafast evolution electric field within bacteriorhodopsin measured monitoring absorption changes tryptophan residue excitation retinal trp absorption decreases within first femtoseconds recovers time scales typical retinal isomerization vibrational relaxation model excitonic coupling retinal tryptophans shows signal reflects gradual rise retinal difference dipole moment precedes probably drives isomerization results suggest intimate connection progressive dipole moment change retinal skeletal changes reported time scale
