mechanical writing ferroelectric polarization
ferroelectric materials characterized permanent electric dipole can reversed application external voltage strong intrinsic coupling polarization deformation also causes ferroelectrics piezoelectric leading applications sensors high-displacement actuators less explored property flexoelectricity coupling polarization strain gradient demonstrate stress gradient generated tip atomic force microscope can mechanically switch polarization nanoscale volume ferroelectric film pure mechanical force can therefore used dynamic tool polarization control may enable applications memory bits written mechanically read electrically
