structure yeast polya polymerase alone complex -datp
polyadenylate [polya] polymerase pap catalyzes addition polyadenosine tail almost eukaryotic messenger rnas mrnas crystal structure pap saccharomyces cerevisiae pap1 solved angstroms alone complex -deoxyadenosine triphosphate -datp like nucleic acid polymerases pap1 composed three domains encircle active site arrangement domains however quite different seen polymerases use template select position incoming nucleotides first two domains functionally analogous polymerase palm fingers domains third domain attached fingers domain known interact single-stranded rna primer nucleotide complex two molecules -datp bound pap1 one occupies position incoming base prior addition mrna chain believed occupy position end mrna primer
