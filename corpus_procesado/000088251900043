imaging vortex-lattice melting process presence disorder 
general arguments suggest first-order phase transitions become less sharp presence weak disorder extensive disorder can transform second-order transitions atomic level details process clear vortex lattice superconductors provides unique system study first-order transition- inter-particle scale well wide range particle densities use differential magneto-optical technique obtain direct experimental visualization melting process disordered superconductor images reveal complex behaviour nucleation pattern formation solid-liquid interface coarsening pinning although local melting found first-order global rounding transition observed results disorder-induced broad distribution local melting temperatures scales mesoscopic level also resolve local hysteretic supercooling microscopic liquid domains nonequilibrium process occurs selected sites disorder-modified melting temperature local maximum revealing nucleation process able experimentally evaluate solid-liquid surface tension rnd extremely small
