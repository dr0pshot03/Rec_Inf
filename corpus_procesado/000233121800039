onset planet formation brown dwarf disks
onset planet formation protoplanetary disks marked growth crystallization sub-micrometer-sized dust grains accompanied dust settling toward disk mid-plane present infrared spectra disks around brown dwarfs brown dwarf candidates show three processes occur cool disks way similar identical disks around low intermediate-mass stars results indicate onset planet formation extends disks around brown dwarfs suggesting planet formation robust process occurring young circumstellar disks
