crystallography correlated disorder 
classical crystallography can determine structures complicated multi-component ribosomal assemblies atomic resolution inadequate disordered systems-even simple water ice-that occupy complex middle ground liquid-like randomness crystalline periodic order correlated disorder nevertheless clear crystallographic signatures map type disorder irrespective underlying physical chemical interactions material involved mapping hints common language disordered states will help us understand control exploit disorder responsible many interesting physical properties
