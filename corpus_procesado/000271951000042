epicontinental seas versus open-ocean settings: kinetics mass extinction origination
environmental perturbations mass extinctions likely manifested differently epicontinental seas open-ocean-facing habitats comparable depth present dissection origination extinction epicontinental seas versus open-ocean-facing coastal regions permian cretaceous periods interval settings well represented fossil record results demonstrate extinction rates significantly higher open-ocean settings epicontinental seas major mass extinctions times origination rates significantly higher open-ocean settings protracted interval late jurassic late cretaceous patterns manifested even paleogeographic environmental variables held fixed indicating epicontinental seas open-ocean-facing coastlines carry distinct macroevolutionary signatures
