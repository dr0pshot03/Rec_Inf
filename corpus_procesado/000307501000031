microbial engineering production advanced biofuels
advanced biofuels produced microorganisms similar properties petroleum-based fuels can drop existing transportation infrastructure however producing biofuels yields high enough useful requires engineering microorganisms metabolism engineering based just one specific feedstock host organism data-driven synthetic-biology approaches can used optimize host pathways maximize fuel production despite success challenges still need met move advanced biofuels towards commercialization compete conventional fuels
