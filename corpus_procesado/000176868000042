chromosome-wide snps reveal ancient origin plasmodium falciparum
malarias eve hypothesis proposing severe recent population bottleneck - years ago human malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum prompted debate origin evolution parasite- hypothesis implies parasite population relatively homogeneous favouring malaria control measures studies however suggested ancient origin large effective population size- test hypothesis analysed single nucleotide polymorphisms snps genes chromosome p falciparum identified polymorphic sites including snps microsatellites five parasite clones establishing chromosome-wide haplotypes dense map one polymorphic marker per similar to2 kilobases basis synonymous snps non-coding snps estimate time recent common ancestor similar to100- years significantly older proposed bottleneck estimated divergence time coincides approximately start human population expansion consistent genetically complex organism able evade host immunity antimalarial efforts
