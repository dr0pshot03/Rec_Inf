mouse b-type lamins required proper organogenesis embryonic stem cells 
b-type lamins major components nuclear lamina believed essential cell proliferation survival found mouse embryonic stem cells escs need lamins self-renewal pluripotency although genome-wide lamin-b binding profiles correlate reduced gene expression binding directly required gene silencing escs trophectoderm cells however b-type lamins required proper organogenesis defects spindle orientation neural progenitor cells migration neurons probably cause brain disorganizations found lamin-b null mice thus studies disprove several prevailing views lamin-bs also establish foundation redefining function nuclear lamina context tissue building homeostasis
