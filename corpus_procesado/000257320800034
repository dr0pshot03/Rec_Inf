reflectance color variations mercury: regolith processes compositional heterogeneity 
multispectral images mercury obtained messenger spacecraft reveal surface overall relatively low reflectance three large scale units identified basis reflectance slope micrometer higher reflectance relatively red material occurs distinct class smooth plains likely emplaced volcanically lower-reflectance material lesser spectral slope may represent distinct crustal component enriched opaque minerals possibly common depth spectrally intermediate terrain probably forms upper crust three spectrally distinct spatially restricted units include fresh crater ejecta less affected space weathering surface materials high reflectance deposits seen crater floors moderately high reflectance relatively reddish material associated rimless depressions
