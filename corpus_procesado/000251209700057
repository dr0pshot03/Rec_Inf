mtor controls mitochondrial oxidative function yy1-pgc alpha transcriptional complex 
transcriptional complexes contain peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor coactivator pgc alpha control mitochondrial oxidative function maintain energy homeostasis response nutrient hormonal signals important component energy nutrient pathways mammalian target rapamycin mtor kinase regulates cell growth size survival- however unknown whether mtor controls mitochondrial oxidative activities show mtor necessary maintenance mitochondrial oxidative function skeletal muscle tissues cells mtor inhibitor rapamycin decreased gene expression mitochondrial transcriptional regulators pgc alpha oestrogen-related receptor nuclear respiratory factors resulting decrease mitochondrial gene expression oxygen consumption using computational genomics identified transcription factor yin-yang yy1 common target mtor pgc alpha knockdown yy1 caused significant decrease mitochondrial gene expression respiration yy1 required rapamycin-dependent repression genes moreover mtor raptor interacted yy1 inhibition mtor resulted failure yy1 interact coactivated pgc alpha therefore identified mechanism nutrient sensor mtor balances energy metabolism means transcriptional control mitochondrial oxidative function results important implications understanding pathways might altered metabolic diseases cancer
