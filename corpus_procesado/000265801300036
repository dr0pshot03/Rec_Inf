compound vesicle fusion increases quantal size potentiates synaptic transmission
exocytosis synapses involves fusion vesicles plasma membrane although compound fusion vesicles proposed occur ribbon-type synapses whether exists mediated role plays conventional synapses remain unclear report existence compound fusion underlying mechanism role nerve terminal containing conventional active zones rats mice found high potassium application high frequency firing induced giant capacitance up-steps reflecting exocytosis vesicles larger regular ones followed giant down-steps reflecting bulk endocytosis intense stimuli also induced giant vesicle-like structures observed electron microscopy giant miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents mepscs reflecting transmitter release calcium sensor vesicle fusion synaptotagmin required giant events high frequency firing calcium/synaptotagmin-dependent mepsc size increase paralleled calcium/synaptotagmin-dependent post-tetanic potentiation results suggest new route exocytosis endocytosis composed three steps first calcium/synaptotagmin mediates compound fusion vesicles second exocytosis compound vesicles increases quantal size increases synaptic strength contributes generation post-tetanic potentiation third exocytosed compound vesicles retrieved via bulk endocytosis suggest vesicle cycling route included models synapses vesicle fusion plasma membrane considered
