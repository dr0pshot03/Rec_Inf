engineering light-gated potassium channel 
present palette opsin-based optogenetic tools lacks light-gated potassium k+ channel desirable silencing excitable cells describe construction blue-light-induced k+ channel blink1 engineered fusing plant lov2-j alpha photosensory module small viral k+ channel kcv blink1 exhibits biophysical features kcv including k+ selectivity high single-channel conductance reversibly photoactivates blue light opening blink1 channels hyperpolarizes cell k+ equilibrium potential ectopic expression blink1 reversibly inhibits escape response light-exposed zebrafish larvae blink1 therefore provides single-component optogenetic tool can establish prolonged physiological hyperpolarization cells low light intensities
