promoter-bound trinucleotide repeat mrna drives epigenetic silencing fragile x syndrome 
epigenetic gene silencing seen several repeat-expansion diseases fragile x syndrome common genetic form mental retardation cgg trinucleotide-repeat expansion adjacent fragile x mental retardation fmr1 gene promoter results epigenetic silencing show fmr1 silencing mediated fmr1 mrna fmr1 mrna contains transcribed cgg-repeat tract part untranslated region hybridizes complementary cgg-repeat portion fmr1 gene form rna dna duplex disrupting interaction mrna cgg-repeat portion fmr1 gene prevents promoter silencing thus data link trinucleotide-repeat expansion form rna-directed gene silencing mediated direct interactions trinucleotide-repeat rna dna
