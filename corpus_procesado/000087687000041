gene targeting homologous recombination drosophila
drosophila offers many advantages experimental organism however comparison yeast mouse two widely used eukaryotic model systems drosophila suffers inability perform homologous recombination introduced dna corresponding chromosomal loci ability specifically modify genomes yeast mouse provides quick easy way generate rescue mutations genes dna clone sequence available method described enables analogous manipulations drosophila genome technique may also applicable organisms gene-targeting procedures yet exist
