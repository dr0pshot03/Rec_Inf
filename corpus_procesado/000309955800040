cold-inducible rna-binding protein modulates circadian gene expression posttranscriptionally 
mammalian tissues circadian gene expression can driven local oscillators systemic signals controlled master pacemaker suprachiasmatic nucleus show simulated body temperature cycles peripheral oscillators controlled rhythmic expression cold-inducible rna-binding protein cirp cultured fibroblasts turn loss-of-function experiments indicated cirp required high-amplitude circadian gene expression transcriptome-wide identification cirp-bound rnas biotin-streptavidin-based cross-linking immunoprecipitation clip procedure revealed several transcripts encoding circadian oscillator proteins including clock moreover clock accumulation strongly reduced cirp-depleted fibroblasts ectopic expression clock improved circadian gene expression cells surmise cirp confers robustness circadian oscillators regulation clock expression
