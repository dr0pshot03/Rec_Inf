helicase-like domains type iii restriction enzymes trigger long-range diffusion along dna 
helicases ubiquitous adenosine triphosphatases atpases widespread roles genome metabolism report previously undescribed functionality atpases helicase-like domains; namely atp hydrolysis can trigger atp-independent long-range protein diffusion dna one dimension 1d specifically using single-molecule fluorescence microscopy show type iii restriction enzyme ecop15i uses atpase switch distinct structural state diffuses dna long distances long times switching occurs upon binding target site requires hydrolysis similar atps define mechanism enzymes show atpase activity involved dna target site verification 1d signaling roles common dna metabolism: example nucleotide excision mismatch repair
