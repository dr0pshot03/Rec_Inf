operation mechanism molecular machine revealed using time-resolved vibrational spectroscopy
rotaxanes comprise macrocycles can shuttle docking stations along axle explored nanosecond shuttling mechanism reversing relative binding affinities two stations ultraviolet-induced transient reduction monitored ensuing changes co-stretching bands two stations shuttling macrocycle means infrared probing pulse hydrogen-bond scission formation initial final stations led well-resolved changes respective co-stretch frequencies departure arrival macrocycle observed separately found shuttling involves two steps: thermally driven escape initial station followed rapid motion along track ending either initial final station varying tracks length found rapid motion approximates biased one-dimensional random walk however surprisingly direction overall motion opposite bias
