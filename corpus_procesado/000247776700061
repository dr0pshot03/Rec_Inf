trench-parallel anisotropy produced foundering arc lower crust
many volcanic arcs display fast seismic shear-wave velocities parallel strike trench pattern anisotropy inconsistent simple models corner flow mantle wedge although several models including slab rollback oblique subduction deformation water-rich olivine proposed explain trench-parallel anisotropy none mechanisms consistent observations instead small-scale convection driven foundering dense arc lower crust provides explanation trench-parallel anisotropy even settings orthogonal convergence slab rollback
