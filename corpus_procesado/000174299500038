antarctic krill sea ice: elevated abundance narrow band just south ice edge
surveyed antarctic krill euphausia superba sea ice using autonomous underwater vehicle autosub- krill concentrated within band ice kilometers south ice edge within band krill densities fivefold greater open water under-ice environment tong considered important habitat krill sampling difficulties previously prevented direct observations ice scale necessary robust krill density estimation autosub enabled us make continuous high-resolution measurements krill density ice reaching kilometers beyond ice edge
