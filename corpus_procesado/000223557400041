sudden onset pitting corrosion stainless steel critical phenomenon
stainless steels undergo sharp rise pitting corrosion rate potential solution concentration temperature changed slightly report experiments using real-time microscopic situ visualizations resolve nucleation evolution individual pits transition suggest sudden onset corrosion explained explosive autocatalytic growth number metastable pits stabilization individual pits takes place later finding agrees theoretical approach treating onset pitting corrosion cooperative critical phenomenon resulting interactions among metastable pits extends perspectives control prevention corrosion onset
