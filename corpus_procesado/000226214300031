normalization tumor vasculature: emerging concept antiangiogenic therapy 
solid tumors require blood vessels growth many new cancer therapies directed tumor vasculature widely held view antiangiogenic therapies destroy tumor vasculature thereby depriving tumor oxygen nutrients review emerging evidence supporting alternative hypothesis-that certain antiangiogenic agents can also transiently "normalize" abnormal structure function tumor vasculature make efficient oxygen drug delivery drugs induce vascular normalization can alleviate hypoxia increase efficacy conventional therapies carefully scheduled better understanding molecular cellular underpinnings vascular normalization may ultimately lead effective therapies cancer also diseases abnormal vasculature well regenerative medicine goal create maintain functionally normal vasculature
