endogenous cannabinoids mediate retrograde signalling hippocampal synapses 
marijuana affects brain function primarily activating g-protein-coupled cannabinoid receptor cb1- expressed throughout brain high levels two endogenous lipids anandamide arachidonylglycerol -ag identified cb1 ligands depolarized hippocampal neurons rapidly release anandamide ag ca2+-dependent manner- hippocampus cb1 expressed mainly gaba gamma aminobutyric acid-mediated inhibitory interneurons cb1 clusters axon terminal- synthetic cb1 agonist depresses gaba release hippocampal slices findings indicate function endogenous cannabinoids released depolarized hippocampal neurons might downregulate gaba release show transient suppression gaba-mediated transmission follows depolarization hippocampal pyramidal neurons mediated retrograde signalling release endogenous cannabinoids signalling endocannabinoid system thus represents mechanism neurons fan communicate backwards across synapses modulate inputs
