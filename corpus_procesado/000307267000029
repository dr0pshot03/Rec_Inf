new atmospherically relevant oxidant sulphur dioxide 
atmospheric oxidation key phenomenon connects atmospheric chemistry globally challenging environmental issues climate change1 stratospheric ozone loss2 acidification soils water3 health effects air quality4 ozone hydroxyl radical nitrate radical generally considered dominant oxidants initiate removal trace gases including pollutants atmosphere present atmospheric observations boreal forest region finland supported laboratory experiments theoretical considerations allow us identify another compound probably stabilized criegee intermediate carbonyl oxide two free-radical sites derivative significant capacity oxidize sulphur dioxide potentially trace gases compound probably enhances reactivity atmosphere particularly regard production sulphuric acid consequently atmospheric aerosol formation findings suggest new atmospherically relevant oxidation route important relative oxidation hydroxyl radical least moderate concentrations radical also find oxidation chemistry compound seems tightly linked presence alkenes biogenic origin
