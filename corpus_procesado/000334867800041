high-resolution genomic analysis human mitochondrial rna sequence variation
mutations mitochondrial genome associated multiple diseases biological processes however little known extent sequence variation mitochondrial transcriptome ultra-deeply sequencing mitochondrial rna >6000x whole blood similar individuals cartagene project identified remarkable levels sequence variation within across individuals well sites show consistent patterns posttranscriptional modification using genome-wide association study find posttranscriptional modification functionally important sites mitochondrial transfer rnas trnas strong genetic control largely driven missense mutation mrpp3 explains similar % variance results reveal major nuclear genetic determinant posttranscriptional modification mitochondria suggest trna posttranscriptional modification may affect cellular energy production
