gene flow maintains large genetic difference clutch size small spatial scale
understanding capacity natural populations adapt local environment central topic evolutionary biology phenotypic differences populations may genetic basis showing reflect different adaptive optima requires quantification gene flow selection- good empirical data rare using data spatially structured island population great tits parus major show persistent difference mean clutch size two subpopulations kilometres apart major genetic component also show immigrants outside island carry genes large clutches gene flow one subpopulation low result low immigration rate together strong selection immigrant genes allowed adaptation island environment maintenance small clutches area however higher gene flow prevents local adaptation maintains larger clutches show observed small-scale genetic difference clutch size due divergent selection island different levels gene flow outside island findings illustrate large effect immigration evolution local adaptations genetic population structure
