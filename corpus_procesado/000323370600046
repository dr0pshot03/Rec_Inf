conformational motions regulate phosphoryl transfer related protein tyrosine phosphatases
many studies implicated role conformational motions catalytic cycle acting optimize binding pocket facilitate product release intimate role chemical reaction described address monitoring active-site loop motion two protein tyrosine phosphatases ptps using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy ptps yoph ptp1b different catalytic rates however find active-site loop closes catalytically competent position rates mirror phosphotyrosine cleavage kinetics loop contains catalytic acid suggesting loop closure occurs concomitantly protonation leaving group tyrosine explains different kinetics two otherwise chemically mechanistically indistinguishable enzymes
