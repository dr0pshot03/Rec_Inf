global circulation oceans atmosphere transports heat around earth broecker denton suggested changes global ocean circulation might triggered enhanced glacial-interglacial cycles proxy data past circulation taken sediment cores south atlantic ocean yielded conflicting interpretations ocean circulation glacial times-deltac variations benthic foraminifera- support idea glacial weakening shutdown north atlantic deep water production whereas proxies cd/ca ba/ca pa-/th ratios show little change last glacial maximum holocene epoch- report neodymium isotope ratios dispersed fe-mn oxide component two southeast atlantic sediment cores cores show variations tend towards north atlantic signatures warm marine isotope stages whereas full glacial stages closer pacific ocean signatures conclude export north atlantic deep water southern ocean resembled present-day conditions warm climate intervals reduced cold stages increase biological productivity may explain various proxy data times reduced north atlantic deep water export
