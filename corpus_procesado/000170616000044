enhanced neurofibrillary degeneration transgenic mice expressing mutant tau app
jnpl3 transgenic mice expressing mutant tau protein develop neurofibrillary tangles progressive motor disturbance crossed tg2576 transgenic mice expressing mutant beta amyloid precursor protein app thus modulating app-a beta beta amyloid peptide environment resulting double mutant tau/app progeny tg2576 parental strain developed beta deposits age however relative jnpl3 mice double mutants exhibited neurofibrillary tangle pathology substantially enhanced limbic system olfactory cortex results indicate either app beta influences formation neurofibrillary tangles interaction beta tau pathologies mice supports hypothesis similar interaction occurs alzheimers disease
