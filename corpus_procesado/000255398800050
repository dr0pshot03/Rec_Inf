genome-wide screen reveals apc-associated rnas enriched cell protrusions 
rna localization important establishment maintenance polarity multiple cell types localized rnas usually transported along microtubules actin filaments become anchored destination underlying subcellular structure retention commonly involves actin actin associated proteins- although cytokeratin filaments dynein anchor certain rnas rna localization important diverse processes ranging cell fate determination synaptic plasticity however far comprehensive studies localized rnas mammalian cells addressed issue focusing migrating fibroblasts polarize form leading edge tail process involves asymmetric distribution rnas- used fractionation scheme combined microarrays identify genome wide scale rnas localize protruding pseudopodia mouse fibroblasts response migratory stimuli find diverse group rnas accumulates pseudopodial protrusions untranslated regions transcripts anchored granules concentrated plus ends detyrosinated microtubules rnas granules associate adenomatous polyposis coli apc tumour suppressor fragile x mental retardation protein fmrp apc required accumulation transcripts protrusions results suggest new type rna anchoring mechanism well new unanticipated function apc localizing rnas
