neonicotinoid pesticide exposure impairs crop pollination services provided bumblebees
recent concern global pollinator declines led considerable research effects pesticides bees- although pesticides typically encountered lethal levels field growing evidence indicating exposure field-realistic levels can sublethal effects bees affecting foraging behaviour homing ability reproductive success bees essential pollination wide variety crops majority wild flowering plants- now research pesticide effects limited direct effects bees pollination services provide show first evidence knowledge pesticide exposure can reduce pollination services bumblebees deliver apples crop global economic importance bumblebee colonies exposed neonicotinoid pesticide provided lower visitation rates apple trees collected pollen less often importantly pesticide-exposed colonies produced apples containing fewer seeds demonstrating reduced delivery pollination services results also indicate reduced pollination service delivery due pesticide-induced changes individual bee behaviour likely due effects colony level findings show pesticide exposure can impair ability bees provide pollination services important implications sustained delivery stable crop yields functioning natural ecosystems
