periplasmic reducing system protects single cysteine residues oxidation
thiol group amino acid cysteine can modified regulate protein activity escherichia coli periplasm oxidizing environment cysteine residues involved disulfide bonds however many periplasmic proteins contain single cysteine residues vulnerable oxidation sulfenic acids irreversibly modified sulfinic sulfonic acids discovered dsbg dsbc two thioredoxin-related proteins control global sulfenic acid content periplasm protect single cysteine residues oxidation dsbg interacts ybis protein along dsbc regulates oxidation catalytic cysteine residue thus potentially widespread mechanism controls sulfenic acid modification cellular environment
