leading-edge vortices elevate lift autorotating plant seeds 
descend autorotating seeds maples trees generate unexpectedly high lift attain elevated performance unknown elucidate mechanisms responsible measured three-dimensional flow around dynamically scaled models maple hornbeam seeds results indicate seeds attain high lift generating stable leading-edge vortex lev descend compact lev verified real specimens allows maple seeds remain air effectively variety nonautorotating seeds levs also explain high lift generated hovering insects bats possibly birds suggesting use levs represents convergent aerodynamic solution evolution flight performance animals plants
