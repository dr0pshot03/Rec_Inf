quantum communication method offers efficient secure ways exchange information network large scale quantum communication- order km achieved however serious problems occur beyond distance scale mainly due inevitable photon loss transmission channel quantum communication eventually fails probability dark count photon detectors becomes comparable probability photon correctly detected overcome problem briegel dur cirac zoller bdcz introduced concept quantum repeaters combining entanglement swapping quantum memory efficiently extend achievable distances although entanglement swapping experimentally demonstrated implementation bdcz quantum repeaters proved challenging owing difficulty integrating quantum memory realize entanglement swapping storage retrieval light building block bdcz quantum repeater follow scheme incorporates strategy bdcz atomic quantum memories two atomic ensembles originally entangled single emitted photon projected entangled state performing joint bell state measurement two single photons passed m fibre based communication channel entanglement stored atomic ensembles later verified converting atomic excitations photons method intrinsically phase insensitive establishes essential element needed realize quantum repeaters stationary atomic qubits quantum memories flying photonic qubits quantum messengers
