endocrinization fgf1 produces neomorphic potent insulin sensitizer
fibroblast growth factor fgf1 autocrine/paracrine regulator whose binding heparan sulphate proteoglycans effectively precludes circulation although fgf1 known mitogenic factor fgf1 knockout mice develop insulin resistance stressed high-fat diet suggesting potential role nutrient homeostasis show parenteral delivery single dose recombinant fgf1rfgf1 results potent insulin-dependent lowering glucose levels diabetic mice dose-dependent lead hypoglycaemia chronic pharmacological treatment rfgf1 increases insulin-dependent glucose uptake skeletal muscle suppresses hepatic production glucose achieve whole-body insulin sensitization sustained glucose lowering insulin sensitization attributed rfgf1 accompanied side effects weight gain liver steatosis bone loss associated current insulin-sensitizing therapies also show glucose-lowering activity fgf1 can dissociated mitogenic activity mediated predominantly via fgf receptor signalling thus uncovered unexpected neomorphic insulin-sensitizing action exogenous non-mitogenic human fgf1 therapeutic potential treatment insulin resistance type diabetes
