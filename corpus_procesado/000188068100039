observational evidence change radiative forcing due indirect aerosol effect 
anthropogenic aerosols enhance cloud reflectivity increasing number concentration cloud droplets leading cooling effect climate known indirect aerosol effect observational support effect based mainly evidence aerosol number concentrations connected droplet concentrations difficult determine impact indirect effects radiative forcing- provide observational evidence substantial alteration radiative fluxes due indirect aerosol effect examine effect aerosols cloud optical properties using measurements aerosol cloud properties two north american sites span polluted clean conditions-a continental site oklahoma high aerosol concentrations arctic site alaska low aerosol concentrations determine cloud optical depth required fit observed shortwave downward surface radiation use cloud parcel model simulate cloud optical depth observed aerosol properties due indirect aerosol effect good agreement simulated indirect aerosol effect observed surface radiation conclude indirect aerosol effect significant influence radiative fluxes
