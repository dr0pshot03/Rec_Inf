vibrio cholerae vpst regulates matrix production motility directly sensing cyclic di-gmp
microorganisms can switch planktonic free-swimming life-style sessile colonial state called biofilm confers resistance environmental stress conversion motile biofilm life-styles attributed increased levels prokaryotic second messenger cyclic di-guanosine monophosphate c-di-gmp yet signaling mechanisms mediating global switch poorly understood show transcriptional regulator vpst vibrio cholerae directly senses c-di-gmp inversely control extracellular matrix production motility identifies vpst master regulator biofilm formation rather regulated phosphorylation vpst undergoes change oligomerization c-di-gmp binding
