xpd/ercc2 regulates cak activity mitotic progression 
general transcription factor iih tfiih consists nine subunits: cyclin-dependent kinase cdk7 cyclin h mat1 forming cdk-activating-kinase cak complex two helicases xpb/hay xpd p34 p44 p52 p62 refs kinase subunit tfiih cdk7 participates basal transcription phosphorylating carboxy-terminal domain largest subunit rna polymerase ii1 part cak cdk7 also phosphorylates cdks essential step activation- show drosophila tfiih component xpd negatively regulates cell cycle function cdk7 cak activity excess xpd titrates cak activity resulting decreased cdk t-loop phosphorylation mitotic defects lethality whereas decrease xpd results increased cak activity cell proliferation moreover xpd downregulated beginning mitosis cdk1 cell cycle target cdk7 active downregulation xpd thus seems contribute upregulation mitotic cak activity regulate mitotic progression positively simultaneously downregulation xpd might major mechanism mitotic silencing basal transcription
