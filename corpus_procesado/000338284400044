terrestrial planet similar au orbit around one member similar au binary
using gravitational microlensing detected cold terrestrial planet orbiting one member binary star system planet low mass twice earths lies projected similar astronomical units au host star distance earth sun however planets temperature much lower < kelvin host star solar masses therefore times less luminous sun host orbits slightly massive companion projected separation au detection consistent systems common straightforward modification current microlensing search strategies increase sensitivity planets binary systems detections binary-star planetary systems constrain models planet formation evolution
