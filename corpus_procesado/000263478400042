genetic defect caused triplet repeat expansion arabidopsis thaliana 
variation length simple dna triplet repeats linked phenotypic variability microbes several human disorders population level forces driving triplet repeat contraction expansion multicellular organisms however well understood identified triplet repeat associated genetic defect arabidopsis thaliana variety collected wild bur strain carries dramatically expanded ttc/ gaa repeat intron isopropyl malate isomerase large sub unit1 iil1 at4g13430 gene repeat expansion causes environment-dependent reduction iil1 activity severely impairs growth strain whereas contraction expanded repeat can reverse detrimental phenotype bur iil1 defect thus presents genetically tractable model triplet repeat expansions variability natural populations
