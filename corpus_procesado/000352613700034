specificity anaphase-promoting complex: single-molecule study 
biological processes require specific enzymatic reactions paradoxically involving short recognition sequences example cell-cycle timing depends sequence ubiquitylation events mediated anaphase-promoting complex apc based short redundant motifs understand origin specificity designed single-molecule fluorescence assays capture transient ubiquitylation reactions find apc-mediated ubiquitylation involves highly processive initial reaction substrate followed multiple encounters reactions slower rate initial ubiquitylation greatly enhances substrates binding affinity subsequent reactions increasing on-rate decreasing off-rate postulate cycles positive feedback enable high specificity substrates short recognition motifs complex cellular environment
