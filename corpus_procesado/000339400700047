electro-optical frequency division stable microwave synthesis
optical frequency division using frequency combs revolutionized time keeping generation stable microwave signals demonstrate optical frequency division microwave generation using tunable electrical oscillator create dual combs phase modulation two optical signals stable difference frequency phase-locked control electrical oscillator means optical frequency division produces stable microwaves approach transposes oscillator frequency reference conventional microwave frequency synthesizer way oscillator experiences large phase noise reduction relative frequency reference electro-optical approach additionally relaxes need highly linear photodetection comb mode spacing well simplicity technique also tunable scalable higher division ratios
