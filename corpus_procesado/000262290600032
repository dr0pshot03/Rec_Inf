direct measurement molecular mobility actively deformed polymer glasses 
sufficient force applied glassy polymer begins deform movement polymer chains used optical photobleaching technique quantitatively measure changes molecular mobility active deformation polymer glass [ poly methyl methacrylate] segmental mobility increases factor uniaxial tensile creep although eyring model can describe increase mobility low stress fails describe mobility flow onset regime mobility strongly accelerated distribution relaxation times narrows substantially indicating homogeneous ensemble local environments even larger stresses strain hardening regime mobility decreases increasing stress consistent view stress induced mobility allows plastic flow polymer glasses observed strong correlation strain rate segmental mobility creep
