status improvements coupled general circulation models 
coupled general circulation models cgcms integrate knowledge atmospheric oceanic circulation different versions cgcms used provide better understanding natural climate variability interannual decadal time scales extended weather forecasting making seasonal climate scenario projections also help reconstruct past climates especially abrupt climate change processes model intercomparisons new test data mainly satellites powerful computers parameterizations atmospheric oceanic processes improved cgcm performance degree model results now used many decision-makers including governments also fundamental detection attribution climate change
