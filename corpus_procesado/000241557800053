control peripheral nerve myelination beta-secretase bace1 
although bace1 beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme essential generation amyloid-beta peptide alzheimers disease physiological function unclear found high levels bace1 expressed time points peripheral nerves become myelinated deficiency bace1 resulted accumulation unprocessed neuregulin nrg1 axonally expressed factor required glial cell development myelination bace1-/- mice displayed hypomyelination peripheral nerves aberrant axonal segregation small-diameter afferent fibers similar seen mice mutations type iii nrg1 schwann cell specific erbb2 knockouts thus bace1 required myelination correct bundling axons schwann cells probably processing type iii nrg1
