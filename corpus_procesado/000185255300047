metapopulation persistence age-dependent disturbance succession
simple metapopulation models random disturbances used species conservation management relying condition persistence per-patch colonization rate greater per-patch extinction rate general model incorporating role succession patch age dependent extinction show persistence requires per-patch colonization rate greater inverse mean patch age age time since patch became available colonization mean patch age can arbitrarily large relative extinction rate currently persisting metapopulations may persisting despite small colonization rates management approaches consider role mean patch age may unnecessarily doom populations extinction
