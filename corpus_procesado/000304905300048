actin network architecture can determine myosin motor activity 
organization actin filaments higher-ordered structures governs eukaryotic cell shape movement global actin network size architecture maintained dynamic steady state regulated assembly disassembly used experimentally defined actin structures vitro investigate activity myosin motors depends network architecture direct visualization filaments revealed myosin-induced actin network deformation reorganization myosins selectively contracted disassembled antiparallel actin structures parallel actin bundles remained unaffected local distribution nucleation sites resulting orientation actin filaments appeared regulate scalability contraction process "orientation selection" mechanism selective contraction disassembly suggests dynamics cellular actin cytoskeleton can spatially controlled actomyosin contractility
