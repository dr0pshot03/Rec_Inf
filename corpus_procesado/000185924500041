females increase offspring heterozygosity fitness extra-pair matings 
females variety species commonly mate multiple males evidence benefit producing offspring higher genetic quality- however nature genetic benefits debated- enhanced offspring survival quality can result intrinsic effects paternal genes good genes-or interactions maternal paternal genomes-compatible genes- evidence latter process accumulating: matings relatives lead decreased reproductive success individual level inbreeding-measured average heterozygosity-is strong fitness predictor- females thus benefit mating genetically dissimilar males many birds social monogamy restricts mate choice females may circumvent pursuing extra-pair copulations show female blue tits parus caeruleus increase heterozygosity progeny extra-pair matings females thereby produce offspring higher reproductive value less inbred individuals increased survival chances elaborate male secondary sexual trait crown colour higher reproductive success cost inbreeding may therefore important factor driving evolution female extra-pair mating
