qirna new type small interfering rna induced dna damage 
rna interference pathways use small rnas mediate gene silencing eukaryotes addition small interfering rnas sirnas micrornas several types endogenously produced small rnas important roles gene regulation germ cell maintenance transposon silencing- production rnas requires synthesis aberrant rnas arnas pre-sirnas specifically recognized rna-dependent rna polymerases make double-stranded rna mechanism arna synthesis recognition largely unknown show dna damage induces expression argonaute protein qde new class small rnas filamentous fungus neurospora crassa class small rnas known qirnas interaction qde- nucleotides long several nucleotides shorter neurospora sirnas strong preference uridine end originate mostly ribosomal dna locus production qirnas requires rna-dependent rna polymerase qde- werner bloom recq dna helicase homologue qde dicers qirna biogenesis also requires dna-damage-induced arnas precursors process dependent qde qde- notably results suggest qde dna-dependent rna polymerase produces arnas furthermore neurospora rna interference mutants show increased sensitivity dna damage suggesting role qirnas dna-damage response inhibiting protein translation
