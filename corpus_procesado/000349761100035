uncovering disease-disease relationships incomplete interactome
according diseasemodule hypothesis cellular components associated disease segregate neighborhood human interactome themap biologically relevant molecular interactions yet given incompleteness interactome limited knowledge disease-associated genes obvious available data sufficient coverage map modules associated disease derive mathematical conditions identifiability disease modules show network-based location disease module determines pathobiological relationship diseases example diseases overlapping network modules show significant coexpression patterns symptom similarity comorbidity whereas diseases residing separated network neighborhoods phenotypically distinct tools represent interactome-based platform predict molecular commonalities phenotypically related diseases even share primary disease genes
