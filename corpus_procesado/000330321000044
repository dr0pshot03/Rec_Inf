vivo genome-wide profiling rna secondary structure reveals novel regulatory features 
rna structure critical roles processes ranging ligand sensing regulation translation polyadenylation splicing- however lack genome-wide vivo rna structural data limited understanding rna structure regulates gene expression living cells present high-throughput genome-wide vivo rna structure probing method structure-seq dimethyl sulphate methylation unprotected adenines cytosines identified next-generation sequencing application method arabidopsis thaliana seedlings yielded first vivo genome-wide rna structure map nucleotide resolution organism quantitative structural information across transcripts analysis reveals three-nucleotide periodic repeat pattern structure coding regions well less-structured region immediately upstream start codon shows features strongly correlated translation efficiency also find patterns strong weak secondary structure sites alternative polyadenylation well strong secondary structure splice sites correlates unspliced events notably vivo structures messenger rnas annotated stress responses poorly predicted silico whereas mrna structures genes related cell function maintenance well predicted global comparison several structural features two categories shows mrnas associated stress responses tend single-strandedness longer maximal loop length higher free energy per nucleotide features may allow rnas undergo conformational changes response environmental conditions structure-seq allows rna structurome biological roles interrogated genome-wide scale applicable organism
