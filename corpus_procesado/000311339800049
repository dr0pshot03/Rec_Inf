water structural transformation molecular hydrophobic interfaces 
hydrophobic hydration considered key role biological processes ranging membrane formation protein folding ligand binding historically hydrophobic hydration shells thought resemble solid clathrate hydrates- solutes surrounded polyhedral cages composed tetrahedrally hydrogen-bonded water molecules recent experimental- theoretical- studies challenged view emphasized importance length scales involved report combined polarized isotopic temperature-dependent raman scattering measurements multivariate curve resolution raman-mcr- explore hydrophobic hydration mapping vibrational spectroscopic features arising hydrophobic hydration shells linear alcohols ranging methanol heptanol data covering entire degrees c temperature range show clear evidence low temperatures hydration shells hydrophobically enhanced water structure greater tetrahedral order fewer weak hydrogen bonds surrounding bulk water structure disappears increasing temperature hydrophobic chains longer similar nm replaced disordered structure weaker hydrogen bonds bulk water observations support current understanding hydrophobic hydration including thermally induced water structural transformation suggestive hydrophobic crossover predicted occur lengths similar nm refs
