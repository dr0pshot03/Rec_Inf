filamentary structure sun magnetic rayleigh-taylor instability
magnetic flux emerges solar surface dark filaments connecting small sunspots opposite polarities- regions around dark filaments often bright x-rays associated jets- implies plasma heating acceleration important coronal heating previous two-dimensional simulations regions showed magnetic reconnection coronal magnetic field emerging flux produced x-ray jets flares left unresolved origin filamentary structure intermittent nature heating report three-dimensional simulations emerging flux showing filamentary structure arises spontaneously magnetic rayleigh taylor instability contrary previous view dark filaments isolated bundles magnetic field rise photosphere carrying dense gas- result magnetic rayleigh taylor instability thin current sheets formed emerging flux magnetic reconnection occurs emerging flux pre-existing coronal field spatially intermittent way explains naturally intermittent nature coronal heating patchy brightenings solar flares
