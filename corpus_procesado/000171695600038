induction pancreatic differentiation signals blood vessels 
blood vessels supply developing organs metabolic sustenance demonstrate role blood vessels source developmental signals pancreatic organogenesis vitro experiments embryonic mouse tissues demonstrate blood vessel endothelium induces insulin expression isolated endoderm removal dorsal aorta xenopus laevis embryos results failure insulin expression vivo furthermore using transgenic mice show ectopic vascularization posterior foregut leads ectopic insulin expression islet hyperplasia results indicate vessels provide metabolic sustenance also provide inductive signals organ development
