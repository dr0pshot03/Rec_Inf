sequential interplay nicotinic gabaergic signaling guides neuronal development 
gaba gamma-aminobutyric acid major inhibitory transmitter brain goes transitory phase excitation development excitatory phase promotes neuronal growth integration circuits show spontaneous nicotinic cholinergic activity responsible terminating gabaergic excitation initiating inhibition changing chloride transporter levels shifting driving force gaba-induced currents timing transition critical two phases gabaergic signaling provide contrasting developmental instructions synergistic nicotinic excitation gabaergic inhibition constrains neuronal morphology innervation results reveal multitiered activity-dependent strategy controlling neuronal development
