rational design alpha-helical tandem repeat proteins closed architectures
tandem repeat proteins formed repetition modular units protein sequence structure play important biological roles macromolecular binding scaffolding domains enzymes building blocks assembly fibrous materials modular nature repeat proteins enables rapid construction diversification extended binding surfaces duplication recombination simple building blocks overall architecture tandem repeat protein structures-which dictated internal geometry local packing repeat building blocks-is highly diverse ranging extended super-helical folds bind peptide dna rna partners- closed compact conformations internal cavities suitable small molecule binding catalysis report development validation computational methods de novo design tandem repeat protein architectures driven purely geometric criteria defining inter-repeat geometry without reference sequences structures existing repeat protein families applied methods design series closed alpha-solenoid repeat structures alpha-toroids inter-repeat packing geometry constrained juxtapose amino n carboxy c termini several designed structures validated x-ray crystallography unlike previous approaches tandem repeat protein engineering- design procedure rely template sequence structural information taken natural repeat proteins hence can produce structures unlike seen nature example successfully designed validated closed alpha-solenoid repeats left-handed helical architecture that-to knowledge-is yet present protein structure database
