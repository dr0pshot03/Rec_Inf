rapid shift classic clinal pattern drosophila reflecting climate change 
geographical clines genetic polymorphisms widely used evidence climatic selection expected shift climate change show classic latitudinal cline alcohol dehydrogenase polymorphism drosophila melanogaster shifted years eastern coastal austratia southern high-latitude populations now genetic constitution northerly populations equivalent shift latitude similar shift detected genetically independent inversion polymorphism whereas two linked polymorphisms exhibiting weaker clinal patterns remained relatively stable genetic changes likely reflect increasingly warmer drier conditions may serve sensitive biomarkers climate change
