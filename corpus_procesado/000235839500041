adsorption-induced scission carbon-carbon bonds
covalent carbon-carbon bonds hard break strength evident hardness diamonds tensile strength polymeric fibres- single-molecule level manifests need forces several nanonewtons extend mechanically rupture one bond forces generated using extensional flow- ultrasonic irradiation receding meniscus directly stretching single molecule nanoprobes- show simple adsorption brush-like macromolecules long side chains substrate can induce conformational deformations also spontaneous rupture covalent bonds macromolecular backbone attribute behaviour fact attractive interaction side chains substrate maximized spreading side chains turn induces tension along polymer backbone provided side-chain densities substrate interaction sufficiently high tension generated will strong enough rupture covalent carbon-carbon bonds expect similar adsorption-induced backbone scission occur macromolecules highly branched architectures brushes dendrimers behaviour needs considered designing surface-targeted macromolecules type either avoid undesired degradation ensure rupture predetermined macromolecular sites
