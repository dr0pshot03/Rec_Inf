phylogenomics reveals deep molluscan relationships 
evolutionary relationships among eight major lineages mollusca remained unresolved despite diversity importance previous investigations molluscan phylogeny based primarily nuclear ribosomal gene sequences- morphological data unsuccessful elucidating relationships recently phylogenomic studies using dozens hundreds genes greatly improved understanding deep animal relationships however limited genomic resources spanning molluscan diversity prevented use phylogenomic approach use transcriptome genome data major lineages except monoplacophora recover well-supported topology mollusca results strongly support aculifera hypothesis placing polyplacophora chitons clade monophyletic aplacophora worm-like molluscs additionally within conchifera sister-taxon relationship gastropoda bivalvia supported grouping received little consideration contains >% molluscan species thus propose node-based name pleistomollusca light results examined evolution morphological characters found support advanced cephalization shells possibly multiple origins within mollusca
