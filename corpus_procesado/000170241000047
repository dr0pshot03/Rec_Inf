sorting striatal cortical interneurons regulated semaphorin-neuropilin interactions 
striatal cortical interneurons arise basal telencephalon later segregating respective targets show migrating cortical interneurons avoid entering striatum chemorepulsive signal composed least part semaphorin 3a semaphorin 3f migrating interneurons expressing neuropilins receptors semaphorins directed cortex; lacking go striatum loss neuropilin function increases number interneurons migrate striatum observations reveal mechanism neuropilins mediate sorting distinct neuronal populations different brain structures provide evidence addition guiding axons receptors also control neuronal migration central nervous system
