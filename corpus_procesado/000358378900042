single-cell chromatin accessibility reveals principles regulatory variation 
cell-to-cell variation universal feature life affects wide range biological phenomena developmental plasticity tumour heterogeneity although recent advances improved ability document cellular phenotypic variation- fundamental mechanisms generate variability identical dna sequences remain elusive reveal landscape principles mammalian dna regulatory variation developing robust method mapping accessible genome individual cells assay transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing atac-seq integrated programmable microfluidics platform single-cell atac-seq scatac-seq maps hundreds single cells aggregate closely resemble accessibility profiles tens millions cells provide insights cell-to-cell variation accessibility variance systematically associated specific trans-factors cis-elements discover combinations trans-factors associated either induction suppression cell-to-cell variability identify sets trans-factors associated cell-type-specific accessibility variance across eight cell types targeted perturbations cell cycle transcription factor signalling evoke stimulus-specific changes observed variability pattern accessibility variation cis across genome recapitulates chromosome compartments de novo linking single-cell accessibility variation three-dimensional genome organization single-cell analysis dna accessibility provides new insight cellular variation regulome
