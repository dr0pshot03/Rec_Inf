kinesin walks hand-over-hand 
kinesin processive motor takes -nm center-of-mass steps along microtubules adenosine triphosphate hydrolyzed whether kinesin moves hand-over-hand inchworm model controversial labeled single head kinesin dimer cy3 fluorophore localized position dye within nm step observed single kinesin heads take steps +/ nm kinetic analysis dwell times steps shows nm steps alternate nm steps results strongly support hand-over-hand mechanism inchworm mechanism addition results suggest kinesin bound heads microtubule waits adenosine triphosphate steps
