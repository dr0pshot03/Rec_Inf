pink1 loss-of-function mutations affect mitochondrial complex activity via ndufa10 ubiquinone uncoupling
resting conditions pink1 knockout cells cells derived patients pink1 mutations display loss mitochondrial complex reductive activity causing decrease mitochondrial membrane potential analyzing phosphoproteome complex liver brain pink1-/- mice found specific loss phosphorylation serine complex subunit ndufa10 phosphorylation serine needed ubiquinone reduction complex phosphomimetic ndufa10 reversed pink1 deficits mouse knockout cells rescued mitochondrial depolarization synaptic transmission defects pinkb9-null mutant drosophila complex deficits adenosine triphosphate synthesis also rescued cells derived pink1 patients thus evolutionary conserved pathway may contribute pathogenic cascade eventually leads parkinsons disease patients pink1 mutations
