reversal interlaminar signal sensory memory processing monkey temporal cortex 
primate temporal cortex implements visual long-term memory however interlaminar circuitry executes cognitive computations poorly understood using linear-array multicontact electrodes simultaneously recorded unit activities across cortical layers perirhinal cortex macaques performing pair-association memory task cortical layers estimated basis current source density profiles histological verifications interlaminar signal flow determined cross-correlation analysis spike trains cue period canonical "feed-forward" signals flowed granular supragranular layers supragranular infragranular layers delay period however signal flow reversed "feed-back" direction: infragranular supragranular layers reversal signal flow highlights temporal cortex differentially recruits laminar circuits sensory mnemonic processing
