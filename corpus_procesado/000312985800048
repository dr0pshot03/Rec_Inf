negative absolute temperature motional degrees freedom
absolute temperature usually bound positive special conditions however negative temperatures-in high-energy states occupied low-energy states-are also possible states demonstrated localized systems finite discrete spectra prepared negative temperature state motional degrees freedom tailoring bose-hubbard hamiltonian created attractively interacting ensemble ultracold bosons negative temperature stable collapse arbitrary atom numbers quasimomentum distribution develops sharp peaks upper band edge revealing thermal equilibrium bosonic coherence several lattice sites negative temperatures imply negative pressures open new parameter regimes cold atoms enabling fundamentally new many-body states
