saponin-detoxifying enzyme mediates suppression plant defences 
plant disease resistance can conferred constitutive features structural barriers preformed antimicrobial secondary metabolites additional defence mechanisms activated response pathogen attack include localized cell death hypersensitive response12 pathogens use different strategies counter constitutive induced plant defences including degradation preformed antimicrobial compounds3 production molecules suppress induced plant defences4- present evidence two-component process fungal pathogen subverts preformed antimicrobial compounds host uses interfere induced defence responses antimicrobial saponins first hydrolysed fungal saponin-detoxifying enzyme degradation product hydrolysis suppresses induced defence responses interfering fundamental signal transduction processes leading disease resistance
