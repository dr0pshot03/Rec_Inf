er tubules mark sites mitochondrial division 
mitochondrial structure distribution regulated division fusion events mitochondrial division regulated dnm1/drp1 dynamin-related protein forms helices around mitochondria mediate fission little known determines sites mitochondrial fission within mitochondrial network endoplasmic reticulum er mitochondria exhibit tightly coupled dynamics extensive contacts tested whether er plays role mitochondrial division found mitochondrial division occurred positions er tubules contacted mitochondria mediated constriction drp1 recruitment thus er tubules may play active role defining position mitochondrial division sites
