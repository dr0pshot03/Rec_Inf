multipotent somatic stem cells contribute stem cell niche drosophila testis 
adult stem cells reside specialized microenvironments niches important role regulating stem cell behaviour1 therefore tight control niche number size function necessary ensure proper balance stem cells progenitor cells available tissue homeostasis wound repair stem cell niche drosophila male gonad located tip testis germline somatic stem cells surround apical hub cluster approximately somatic cells required stem cell self renewal maintenance2- show somatic stem cells drosophila testis contribute apical hub somatic cyst cell lineage drosophila orthologue epithelial cadherin de cadherin required somatic stem cell maintenance consequently apical hub furthermore data indicate transcriptional repressor escargot regulates ability somatic cells assume and/ maintain hub cell identity data highlight dynamic relationship stem cells niche provide insight genetic programmes regulate niche size function support normal tissue homeostasis organ regeneration throughout life
