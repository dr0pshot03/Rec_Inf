evidence karyogamy exchange genetic material binucleate intestinal parasite giardia intestinalis
diplomonad parasite giardia intestinalis contains two functionally equivalent nuclei inherited independently mitosis although presumed asexual giardia low levels allelic heterozygosity indicating two nuclear genomes may exchange genetic material fluorescence situ hybridization performed probes episomal plasmid suggests plasmids transferred nuclei cyst transmission electron micrographs demonstrate fusion cyst nuclei green fluorescent protein fusions giardial homologs meiosis specific genes localized nuclei cysts vegetative trophozoite data suggest fusion nuclei karyogamy subsequently somatic homologous recombination facilitated meiosis gene homologs occur giardial cyst
