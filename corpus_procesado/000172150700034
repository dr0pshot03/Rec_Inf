auxin regulates scftir1-dependent degradation aux/iaa proteins 
plant hormone auxin central many aspects plant development previous studies implicated ubiquitin-ligase scftir1 aux/iaa proteins auxin response dominant mutations several aux/iaa genes confer pleiotropic auxin-related phenotypes whereas recessive mutations affecting function scftir1 decrease auxin response show scftir1 required aux/iaa degradation demonstrate scftir1 interacts axr2/iaa7 axr3/iaa17 domain ii proteins necessary sufficient interaction auxin stimulates binding scftir1 aux/iaa proteins degradation domain ii conserved nearly aux/iaa proteins arabidopsis propose auxin promotes degradation large family transcriptional regulators leading diverse downstream effects
