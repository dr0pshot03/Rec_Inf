insight sumatra-andaman earthquake gps measurements southeast asia
data collected global positioning system gps sites southeast asia show crustal deformation caused december sumatra andaman earthquake unprecedented large scale small significant co-seismic jumps clearly detected km earthquake epicentre nearest sites still km away show displacements cm show rupture plane earthquake must least km long non-homogeneous slip required fit large displacement gradients revealed gps measurements kinematic analysis gps recordings indicates centroid released deformation located least km north seismological epicentre also provides evidence rupture propagated northward sufficiently fast stations northern thailand reached final positions less min earthquake hence ruling hypothesis silent slow aseismic rupture
