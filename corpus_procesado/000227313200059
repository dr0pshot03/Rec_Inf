genotypic diversity within natural coastal bacterioplankton population
genomic diversity relative importance distinct genotypes within natural bacterial populations remained largely unknown analyze diversity annual dynamics group coastal bacterioplankton greater % 16s ribosomal rna identity vibrio splendidus show group consists least thousand distinct genotypes occurring extremely low environmental concentrations average less one cell per milliliter overall genomes show extensive allelic diversity size variation individual genotypes rarely recurred samples allelic distribution show spatial temporal substructure ecological considerations suggest much genotypic possibly phenotypic variation within natural populations considered neutral
