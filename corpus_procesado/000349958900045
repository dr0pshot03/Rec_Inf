ctcf establishes discrete functional chromatin domains hox clusters differentiation
polycomb trithorax group proteins encode epigenetic memory cellular positional identity establishing inheritable domains repressive active chromatin within hox clusters demonstrate ccctc-binding factor ctcf functions insulate adjacent yet antagonistic chromatin domains embryonic stem cell differentiation cervical motor neurons deletion ctcf binding sites within hox clusters results expansion active chromatin repressive domain ctcf functions insulator organizing hox clusters spatially disjoint domains ablation ctcf binding disrupts topological boundaries caudal hox genes leave repressed domain become subject transcriptional activation hence ctcf required insulate facultative heterochromatin impinging euchromatin produce discrete positional identities
