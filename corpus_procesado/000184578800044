neuronal populations single cells representing learned auditory objects
neural representations associated learned auditory behaviours recognizing individuals based vocalizations well described higher vertebrates learn recognize complex conspecific vocalizations comprise sequences easily identified naturally occurring auditory objects facilitate analysis higher auditory pathways describe first example neurons selective learned conspecific vocalizations adult animals-in starlings trained operantly recognize conspecific songs neuronal population found non-primary forebrain auditory region exhibits increased responses set learned songs compared novel songs shows differential responses categories learned songs based recognition training contingencies within population many cells respond highly selectively subset specific motifs acoustic objects present learned songs neuronal selectivity may contribute song-recognition behaviour starlings sensitive motif identity system top-down bottom-up processes may modify tuning properties neurons recognition learning giving rise plastic representations behaviourally meaningful auditory objects
