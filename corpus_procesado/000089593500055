ubiquitin-activating/conjugating activity tafii mediator activation gene expression drosophila 
ubiquitination histones linked complex processes regulate activation eukaryotic transcription however cellular factors interpose histone modification processes transcriptional activation well characterized biochemical approach identified drosophila coactivator tafii central subunit within general transcription factor tfiid histone-specific ubiquitin-activating/conjugating enzyme ubac tafii mediates monoubiquitination histone h1 vitro point mutations within putative ubac domain tafii abolished h1-specific ubiquitination vitro drosophila embryo inactivation tafii ubac activity reduces cellular level monoubiquitinated histone h1 expression genes targeted maternal activator dorsal thus coactivator-mediated ubiquitination proteins within transactivation pathway may contribute processes directing activation eukaryotic transcription
