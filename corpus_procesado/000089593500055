ubiquitin-activating/conjugating activity tafii250 mediator activation gene expression drosophila 
ubiquitination histones linked complex processes regulate activation eukaryotic transcription however cellular factors interpose histone modification processes transcriptional activation well characterized biochemical approach identified drosophila coactivator tafii250 central subunit within general transcription factor tfiid histone-specific ubiquitin-activating/conjugating enzyme ubac tafii250 mediates monoubiquitination histone h1 vitro point mutations within putative ubac domain tafii250 abolished h1-specific ubiquitination vitro drosophila embryo inactivation tafii250 ubac activity reduces cellular level monoubiquitinated histone h1 expression genes targeted maternal activator dorsal thus coactivator-mediated ubiquitination proteins within transactivation pathway may contribute processes directing activation eukaryotic transcription
