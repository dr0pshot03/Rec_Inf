trithorax dcbp acting complex maintain expression homeotic gene 
trithorax trx member trithorax group trxg epigenetic regulators required maintain active states hox gene expression development purified drosophila embryos trithorax acetylation complex tac1 contains trx dcbp sbf1 like cbp tac1 acetylates core histories nucleosomes suggesting activity may important epigenetic maintenance gene activity dcbp sbf1 associate specific sites salivary gland polytene chromosomes colocalizing many trx binding sites one site hox gene ultrabithorax ubx mutations either trx gene encoding dcbp reduce expression endogenous ubx gene well transgenes driven bxd regulatory region ubx thus trx dcbp sbf1 closely linked physically functionally maintenance hox gene expression
