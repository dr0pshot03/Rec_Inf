learned predictions error likelihood anterior cingulate cortex 
anterior cingulate cortex acc related medial wall play critical role recruiting cognitive control although acc exhibits selective error conflict responses unclear develop become context-specific use modified stop-signal task show integrated computational neural modeling neuroimaging studies acc learns predict error likelihood given context even trials error response conflict results support general error-likelihood theory acc function based reinforcement learning conflict error detection special cases
