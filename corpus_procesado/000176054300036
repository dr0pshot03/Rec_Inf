direct cortical control 3d neuroprosthetic devices
three-dimensional 3d movement neuroprosthetic devices can controlled activity cortical neurons appropriate algorithms used decode intended movement real time previous studies assumed neurons maintain fixed tuning properties studies used subjects unaware movements predicted recorded units study subjects real-time visual feedback brain-controlled trajectories cell tuning properties changed used brain-controlled movements using control algorithms track changes subjects made long sequences 3d movements using far fewer cortical units expected daily practice improved movement accuracy directional tuning units
