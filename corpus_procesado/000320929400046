temporal patterning drosophila medulla neuroblasts controls neural fates
drosophila optic lobes medulla processes visual information coming inner photoreceptors r7 r8 lamina neurons contains approximately neurons belonging different types describe precise temporal patterning neural progenitors generates different neural types five transcription factors-homothorax eyeless sloppy paired dichaete tailless-are sequentially expressed temporal cascade medulla neuroblasts age loss eyeless sloppy paired dichaete blocks progression temporal sequence provide evidence temporal sequence neuroblasts together notch-dependent binary fate choice controls diversification neuronal progeny although temporal sequence transcription factors identified drosophila embryonic neuroblasts work illustrates generality strategy different sequences transcription factors used different contexts
