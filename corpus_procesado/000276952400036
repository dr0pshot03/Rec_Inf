mechanism kinetics spontaneous nanotube growth driven screw dislocations
single-crystal nanotubes commonly observed formation often understood show nanotube growth can driven axial screw dislocations: self-perpetuating growth spirals enable anisotropic growth dislocation strain energy overcomes surface energy required creating new inner surface forming hollow tubes spontaneously demonstrated solution-grown zinc oxide nanotubes nanowires controlling supersaturation using flow reactor confirmed using microstructural characterization agreement experimental growth kinetics predicted fundamental crystal growth theories confirms growth nanotubes driven dislocations
