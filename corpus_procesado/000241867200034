crystal structure rhomboid family intramembrane protease
escherichia coli glpg integral membrane protein belongs widespread rhomboid protease family rhomboid proteases like site protease s2p gamma-secretase unique cleave transmembrane domain membrane proteins describe angstrom resolution crystal structure glpg core domain structure contains six transmembrane segments residues previously shown involved catalysis including ser-his dyad several water molecules found protein interior depth membrane surface putative active site accessible substrate large v-shaped opening faces laterally towards lipid blocked half-submerged loop structure observations indicate intramembrane proteolysis scission peptide bonds takes place within hydrophobic environment membrane bilayer crystal structure also suggests gating mechanism glpg controls substrate access hydrophilic active site
