phase-locking environmental fluctuations generate synchrony predator-prey community 
spatially synchronized fluctuations system state common physical biological systems ranging individual atoms species diverse viruses insects mammals- although causal factors well known many synchronized phenomena several processes concurrently impact spatial synchrony species making separate effects interactions difficult quantify develop general stochastic model predator-prey spatial dynamics predict outcome laboratory microcosm experiment testing interactions among known synchronizing factors: dispersal individuals populations spatially synchronous fluctuations exogenous environmental factors moran effect interactions species example predators spatially synchronized moran effect synchronized populations ciliate protist tetrahymena pyriformis however dispersal synchronized prey populations presence predator euplotes patella model data indicate synchrony depends cyclic dynamics generated predator dispersal moran effect phase-locks cycles otherwise become decoherent drift phase absence cycles phase-locking possible synchronizing effect dispersal negligible interspecific interactions determine population synchrony providing additional source synchronized fluctuations altering population dynamics thereby enhancing action dispersal results robust wide variation model parameters representative many natural predator-prey host-pathogen systems explains cyclic systems provide many dramatic examples spatial synchrony nature
