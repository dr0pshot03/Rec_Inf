thermalization mechanism generic isolated quantum systems
understanding temporal evolution isolated many-body quantum systems long elusive recently meaningful experimental studies problem become possible stimulating theoretical interest- generic isolated systems non equilibrium dynamics expected result thermalization: relaxation states values macroscopic quantities stationary universal respect widely differing initial conditions predictable using statistical mechanics however obvious feature many body quantum mechanics makes quantum thermalization possible sense analogous dynamical chaos makes classical thermalization possible example dynamical chaos occur isolated quantum system time evolution linear spectrum discrete recent studies even suggest statistical mechanics may give incorrect predictions outcomes relaxation systems demonstrate generic isolated quantum many body system relax state well described standard statistical mechanical prescription moreover show time evolution plays merely auxiliary role relaxation thermalization instead happens level individual eigenstates first proposed deutsch srednicki striking consequence eigenstate thermalization scenario confirmed system knowledge single many body eigenstate sufficient compute thermal averages eigenstate microcanonical energy window will give result
