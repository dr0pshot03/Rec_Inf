hemispherical variations seismic velocity top earths inner core
knowledge seismic velocity structure top earths inner core important deciphering physical processes responsible inner-core growth- previous global seismic studies- focused structures found km deeper within inner core results uppermost km available isolated regions- present constraints seismic velocity variations just beneath inner-core boundary determined difference travel time waves reflected inner-core boundary transmitted inner core found traveltime residuals-observed global seismograph stations several regional seismic networks-are systematically larger s waves sample eastern hemisphere inner core degrees e degrees e compared sample western hemisphere degrees w degrees e residuals show correlation angle waves traverse inner core indicates seismic anisotropy strong region isotropic seismic velocity eastern hemisphere % higher western hemisphere
