cortical interneurons specialize disinhibitory control 
mammalian cerebral cortex diversity interneuronal subtypes underlies division labour subserving distinct modes inhibitory control- unique mode inhibitory control may provided inhibitory neurons specifically suppress firing inhibitory neurons disinhibition lead selective amplification local processing serve important computational functions gating gain modulation although several interneuron populations known target interneurons varying degrees- little known interneurons specializing disinhibition vivo function show class interneurons express vasoactive intestinal polypeptide vip mediates disinhibitory control multiple areas neocortex recruited reinforcement signals combining optogenetic activation single-cell recordings examined functional role vip interneurons awake mice investigated underlying circuit mechanisms vitro auditory medial prefrontal cortices identified basic disinhibitory circuit module activation vip interneurons transiently suppresses primarily somatostatin fraction parvalbumin-expressing inhibitory interneurons specialize control input output principal cells respectively performance auditory discrimination task reinforcement signals reward punishment strongly uniformly activated vip neurons auditory cortex turn vip recruitment increased gain functional subpopulation principal neurons results reveal specific cell type microcircuit underlying disinhibitory control cortex demonstrate activated specific behavioural conditions
