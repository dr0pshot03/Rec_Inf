combined action phd chromo domains directs rpd3s hdac transcribed chromatin
nucleosomes must deacetylated behind elongating rna polymerase ii prevent cryptic initiation transcription within coding region rna polymerase ii signals deacetylation methylation histone h3 lysine h3k36 provides recruitment signal rpd3s histone deacetylase complex hdac recognition methyl h3k36 rpd3s requires chromodomain eaf3 subunit paradoxically eaf3 also subunit nua4 acetyltransferase complex yet nua4 recognize methyl h3k36 nucleosomes saccharomyces cerevisiae found methyl h3k36 nucleosome recognition rpd3s also requires plant homeobox domain phd rco1 subunit thus coupled chromo phd domains rpd3s specify recognition methyl h3k36 mark demonstrating first combinatorial domain requirement within protein complex read specific histone code
