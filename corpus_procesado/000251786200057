visualizing spatially correlated dynamics directs rna conformational transitions 
rnas fold three dimensional 3d structures subsequently undergo large functionally important conformational transitions response variety cellular signals1- rna structures believed encode spatially tuned flexibility can direct transitions along specific conformational pathways45 however hypothesis proved difficult examine directly atomic movements complex biomolecules visualized 3d using current experimental methods report successful implementation strategy using nmr allowed us visualize complete 3d rotational sensitivity dynamics two rna helices linked functionally important trinucleotide bulge timescales extending milliseconds key approach anchor nmr frames reference onto helix thereby directly measure dynamics one relative using relativistic sets residual dipolar couplings rdcs67 using approach uncovered super large amplitude helix motions trace surprisingly structured spatially correlated 3d dynamic trajectory two helices twist around individual axes approximately highly correlated manner r simultaneously r bending degrees remarkably 3d dynamic trajectory dotted various positions seven distinct ligand bound conformations rna thus even partly unstructured rnas can undergo structured dynamics directs ligand induced transitions along specific predefined conformational pathways
