discovery hidden blazars
every radio-loud quasar may blazar activities according unified scheme differences optical radio observations radio-loud quasars result different viewing angles predicted blazars may detected using emission line ratio variations caused variable illumination gas clouds broad emission line region spectroscopic search quasars redshift discovered large >% variations emission tine ratios civ/ciii] civ/ly alpha compared data taken years ago result consistent prediction supports unification scheme radio-loud quasars
