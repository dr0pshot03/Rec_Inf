water freezes differently positively negatively charged surfaces pyroelectric materials
although ice melts water freezes equilibrium conditions degrees c water can supercooled homogeneous conditions clean environment degrees c without freezing influence electric field freezing temperature supercooled water electrofreezing topical importance living inanimate worlds report positively charged surfaces pyroelectric litao crystals srtio thin films promote ice nucleation whereas surfaces negatively charged reduce freezing temperature accordingly droplets water cooled negatively charged litao surface remaining liquid degrees c freeze immediately surface heated degrees c result replacement negative surface charge positive one furthermore powder x-ray diffraction studies demonstrated freezing positively charged surface starts solid/water interface whereas negatively charged surface ice nucleation starts air/water interface
