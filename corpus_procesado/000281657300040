human sirt6 promotes dna end resection ctip deacetylation
sirt6 belongs sirtuin family protein lysine deacetylases regulate aging genome stability found human sirt6 role promoting dna end resection crucial step dna double-strand break dsb repair homologous recombination sirt6 depletion impaired accumulation replication protein single-stranded dna dna damage sites reduced rates homologous recombination sensitized cells dsb-inducing agents identified dsb resection protein ctip [c-terminal binding protein ctbp interacting protein] sirt6 interaction partner showed sirt6-dependent ctip deacetylation promotes resection nonacetylatable ctip mutant alleviated effect sirt6 depletion resection thus identifying ctip key substrate sirt6 facilitates dsb processing homologous recombination findings clarify sirt6 promotes genome stability
