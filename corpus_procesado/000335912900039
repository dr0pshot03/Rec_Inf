stick insect genomes reveal natural selections role parallel speciation
natural selection can drive repeated evolution reproductive isolation genomic basis parallel speciation remains poorly understood analyzed whole-genome divergence replicate pairs stick insect populations adapted different host plants undergoing parallel speciation found thousands modest-sized genomic regions accentuated divergence populations unique individual population pairs also detected parallel genomic divergence across population pairs involving excess coding genes specific molecular functions regions parallel genomic divergence nature exhibited exceptional allele frequency changes hosts field transplant experiment results advance understanding biological diversification providing convergent observational experimental evidence selections role driving repeatable genomic divergence
