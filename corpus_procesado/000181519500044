timing atmospheric co2 antarctic temperature changes across termination iii
analysis air bubbles ice cores yielded precise record atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations timing changes gases respect temperature accurately known uncertainty gas age-ice age difference measured isotopic composition argon air bubbles vostok core termination iii similar to240 years present record likely reflects temperature accumulation change although mechanism remains unclear sequence events termination iii suggests co2 increase tagged antarctic deglacial warming +/ years preceded northern hemisphere deglaciation
