structure repulsive guidance molecule rgm-neogenin signaling hub 
repulsive guidance molecule family members rgms control fundamental diverse cellular processes including motility adhesion immune cell regulation systemic iron metabolism however known rgms initiate signaling common cell-surface receptor neogenin neo1 present crystal structures neo1 rgm-binding region complex human rgmb also called dragon rgmb structure reveals previously unknown protein fold functionally important autocatalytic cleavage mechanism provides framework explain numerous disease-linked mutations rgms complex two rgmb ectodomains conformationally stabilize juxtamembrane regions two neo1 receptors ph-dependent manner demonstrate rgm-neo1 complexes share architecture therefore represents core multiple signaling pathways
