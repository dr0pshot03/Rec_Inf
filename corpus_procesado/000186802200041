high deleterious genomic mutation rate stationary phase escherichia coli
natural habitats bacteria spend time form growth arrest little known deleterious mutations stages consequently limited understanding evolutionary events occur deleterious mutation accumulation experiment prolonged stationary phase escherichia coli slightly deleterious mutations observed per genome per day order magnitude higher extrapolations fast-growing cells line inferences observations adaptive stationary phase mutation experiments findings may affect understanding bacterial evolution emergence bacterial pathogenicity
