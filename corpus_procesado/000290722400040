global quantification mammalian gene expression control 
gene expression multistep process involves transcription translation turnover messenger rnas proteins although one fundamental processes life entire cascade never quantified genome-wide scale simultaneously measured absolute mrna protein abundance turnover parallel metabolic pulse labelling genes mammalian cells whereas mrna protein levels correlated better previously thought corresponding half-lives showed correlation using quantitative model obtained first genome-scale prediction synthesis rates mrnas proteins find cellular abundance proteins predominantly controlled level translation genes similar combinations mrna protein stability shared functional properties indicating half-lives evolved energetic dynamic constraints quantitative information stages gene expression provides rich resource helps provide greater understanding underlying design principles
