engineering yeast transcription machinery improved ethanol tolerance production 
global transcription machinery engineering gtme approach reprogramming gene transcription elicit cellular phenotypes important technological applications show application gtme saccharomyces cerevisiae improved glucose/ethanol tolerance key trait many biofuels programs mutagenesis transcription factor spt15p selection led dominant mutations conferred increased tolerance efficient glucose conversion ethanol desired phenotype results combined effect three separate mutations spt15 gene [ serine substituted phenylalanine pheser similarly tyrhis lysarg] thus gtme can provide route complex phenotypes readily accessible traditional methods
