trans-snare pairing can precede hemifusion intermediate intracellular membrane fusion
question concerning whether membranes fuse according mechanism yet answered satisfactorily fusion model membranes viruses membranes dock outer membrane leaflets mix termed hemifusion finally fusion pore opens contents mix viral fusion proteins consist membrane-disturbing fusion peptide helical bundle pin membranes together- although snare soluble n-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor complexes form helical bundles similar topology unknown whether snare-dependent fusion events intracellular membranes proceed hemifusion state identify first hemifusion state snare-dependent fusion native membranes place sequence molecular events: formation helical bundles snares precedes hemifusion progression pore opening requires additional peptides thus snare-dependent fusion may proceed along pathway viral fusion: use docking mechanism via helical bundles additional peptides destabilize membrane efficiently induce lipid mixing- results suggest common lipidic intermediate may underlie fusion reactions lipid bilayers
