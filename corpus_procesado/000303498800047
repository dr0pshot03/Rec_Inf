removal shelterin reveals telomere end-protection problem
telomere end-protection problem defined aggregate dna damage signaling repair pathways require repression telomeres define end-protection problem removed whole shelterin complex mouse telomeres conditional deletion trf1 trf2 nonhomologous end-joining nhej deficient cells data reveal two dna damage response pathways previously observed upon deletion individual shelterin proteins shelterin-free telomeres processed microhomology-mediated alternative-nhej ku70/ absent attacked nucleolytic degradation absence 53bp1 data establish end-protection problem specified six pathways [atm ataxia telangiectasia mutated atr ataxia telangiectasia rad3 related signaling classical-nhej alt-nhej homologous recombination resection] show shelterin acts general dna damage response factors solve problem
