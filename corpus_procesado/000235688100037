bacterial small-molecule signaling pathways 
bacteria use diverse small molecules extra intracellular signaling scan small-molecule mixtures access information extracellular environment intracellular physiological status based information continuously interpret circumstances react rapidly changes bacteria must integrate extra intracellular signaling information mount appropriate responses changes environment review recent research two fundamental bacterial small-molecule signaling pathways: extracellular quorum-sensing signaling intracellular cyclic dinucleotide signaling suggest two pathways may converge control complex processes including multicellularity biofilm formation virulence also outline new questions arisen recent studies fields
