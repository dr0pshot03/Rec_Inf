modulation trpa1 thermal sensitivity enables sensory discrimination drosophila 
discriminating among sensory stimuli critical animal survival discrimination particularly essential evaluating whether stimulus noxious innocuous insects humans transient receptor potential trp channels key transducers thermal chemical sensory cues many trps multimodal receptors respond diverse stimuli- animals distinguish sensory inputs activating trp largely unknown determine stimuli activating drosophila trpa1 discriminated although drosophila trpa1 responds noxious chemicals innocuous warming find trpa1-expressing chemosensory neurons respond chemicals warmth specificity conferred chemosensory-specific trpa1 isoform reduced thermosensitivity compared previously described isoform molecular level reduction results unique region robustly reduces channels thermosensitivity cell-type segregation trpa1 activity critical: thermosensory isoform expressed chemosensors flies respond innocuous warming regurgitation nocifensive response trpa1 isoform diversity conserved malaria mosquitoes indicating similar mechanisms may allow discrimination host-derived warmth-an attractant-from chemical repellents findings indicate reducing thermosensitivity can critical trp channel functional diversification facilitating use contexts thermal sensitivity can maladaptive
