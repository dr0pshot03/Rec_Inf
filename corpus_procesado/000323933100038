expanding fluorine chemistry living systems using engineered polyketide synthase pathways 
organofluorines represent rapidly expanding proportion molecules used pharmaceuticals diagnostics agrochemicals materials despite prevalence fluorine synthetic compounds known biological scope limited single pathway produces fluoroacetate demonstrate pathway can exploited source fluorinated building blocks introduction fluorine natural-product scaffolds specifically constructed pathways involving two polyketide synthase systems show fluoroacetate can used incorporate fluorine polyketide backbone vitro show fluorine can inserted site-selectively introduced polyketide products vivo results highlight prospects production complex fluorinated natural products using synthetic biology
