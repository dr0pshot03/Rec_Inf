probing high-barrier pathways surface reactions scanning tunneling microscopy
ability scanning tunneling microscopy probe pathways thermally activated high-barrier surface processes frequently limited competing low-barrier processes can confuse measurement true initial final configuration introduce approach circumvent difficulty driving surface process nanosecond laser heating method applied determine pathway recombinative desorption h/si system observed configuration dangling bonds laser heating reveals desorbed hydrogen molecules formed single dimers rather neighboring silicon dimers via interdimer reaction pathway
