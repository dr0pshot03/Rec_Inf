h2s: universal defense antibiotics bacteria
many prokaryotic species generate hydrogen sulfide h2s natural environments however biochemistry physiological role gas nonsulfur bacteria remain largely unknown demonstrate inactivation putative cystathionine beta-synthase cystathionine gamma-lyase mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase bacillus anthracis pseudomonas aeruginosa staphylococcus aureus escherichia coli suppresses h2s production rendering pathogens highly sensitive multitude antibiotics exogenous h2s suppresses effect moreover bacteria normally produce h2s nitric oxide two gases act synergistically sustain growth mechanism gas-mediated antibiotic resistance relies mitigation oxidative stress imposed antibiotics
