transcription elongation factors repress transcription initiation cryptic sites
previous studies suggested transcription elongation results changes chromatin structure present studies saccharomyces cerevisiae spt6 conserved protein implicated transcription elongation chromatin structure results show surprisingly spt6 mutant permits aberrant transcription initiation within coding regions furthermore transcribed chromatin spt6 mutant hypersensitive micrococcal nuclease hypersensitivity suppressed mutational inactivation rna polymerase ii results suggest spt6 plays critical role maintaining normal chromatin structure transcription elongation thereby repressing transcription initiation cryptic promoters elongation chromatin factors including spt16 histone h3 appear contribute control
