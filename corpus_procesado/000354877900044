multiplex single-cell profiling chromatin accessibility combinatorial cellular indexing
technical advances enabled collection genome transcriptome data sets single-cell resolution however single-cell characterization epigenome remained challenging furthermore cells must physically separated biochemical processing conventional single-cell preparatory methods scale linearly applied combinatorial cellular indexing measure chromatin accessibility thousands single cells per assay circumventing need compartmentalization individual cells report chromatin accessibility profiles single cells use data cluster cells basis chromatin accessibility landscapes identify modules coordinately regulated chromatin accessibility level single cells within cell types scalable method may accelerate progress toward human cell atlas
