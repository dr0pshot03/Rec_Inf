zebrafish nodal signal squint functions morphogen 
secreted morphogens induce distinct cellular responses concentration-dependent manner act directly distance- existence morphogens mesoderm induction patterning vertebrates highly controversial remains unknown whether endogenous mesoderm inducers act directly morphogens- function locally act relay mechanisms- test morphogen properties cyclops squint-two nodal-related transforming growth factor-beta signals required mesoderm formation patterning zebrafish- whereas different levels squint cyclops can induce different downstream genes- rnd squint can function directly distance results indicate squint acts secreted morphogen require relay mechanism
