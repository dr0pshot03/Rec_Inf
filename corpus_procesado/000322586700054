functional lysine modification intrinsically reactive primary glycolytic metabolite 
posttranslational modification proteins regulation metabolites represent conserved mechanisms biology confluence two processes report primary glycolytic intermediate -bisphosphoglycerate -bpg reacts select lysine residues proteins form phosphoglyceryl-lysine pgk reaction require enzyme catalysis rather exploits electrophilicity -bpg found proteomic profiling enriched diverse classes proteins prominently around active sites glycolytic enzymes pgk modifications inhibit glycolytic enzymes cells exposed high glucose accumulate enzymes create potential feedback mechanism contributes buildup redirection glycolytic intermediates alternate biosynthetic pathways
