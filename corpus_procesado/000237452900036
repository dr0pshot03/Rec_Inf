aggresomes autophagy generate sites virus replication 
replication many viruses associated specific intracellular compartments called virus factories virioplasm thought provide physical scaffold concentrate viral components thereby increase efficiency replication formation virus replication sites often results rearrangement cellular membranes reorganization cytoskeleton similar rearrangements seen cells response protein aggregation aggresomes autophagosomes produced facilitate protein degradation review evidence viruses induce aggresomes autophagosomes generate sites replication
