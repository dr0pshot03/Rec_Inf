charge transfer equilibria diamond aqueous oxygen electrochemical redox couple 
undoped high-quality diamond almost circumstances one best insulators known however diamond covered chemically bound hydrogen shows pronounced conductivity exposed air conductivity arises positive-charge carriers holes confined narrow near-surface region although several explanations proposed none received wide acceptance mechanism remains controversial report interactions hydrogen-terminated macroscopic diamonds diamond powders aqueous solutions controlled ph oxygen concentration show electrons transfer diamond electrochemical reduction/oxidation couple involving oxygen charge transfer responsible surface conductivity also influences contact angles zeta potentials effect confined diamond may play previously unrecognized role disparate systems
