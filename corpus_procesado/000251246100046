melanocortin receptor allele suggests varying pigmentation among neanderthals 
melanocortin receptor mc1r regulates pigmentation humans vertebrates variants mc1r reduced function associated pale skin color red hair humans primarily european origin amplified sequenced fragment mc1r gene mc1r two neanderthal remains specimens mutation found similar modern humans analyzed functional analyses show variant reduces mc1r activity level alters hair and/or skin pigmentation humans impaired activity variant suggests neanderthals varied pigmentation levels potentially scale observed modern humans data suggest inactive mc1r variants evolved independently modern humans neanderthals
