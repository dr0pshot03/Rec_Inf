decrease co2 uptake capacity ice-free arctic ocean basin 
predicted arctic ocean will sequester much greater amounts carbon dioxide co2 atmosphere result sea ice melt increasing primary productivity however prediction made basis observations either highly productive ocean margins ice-covered basins recent major ice retreat report high-resolution survey sea-surface co2 concentration across canada basin showing great increase relative earlier observations rapid co2 invasion atmosphere low biological co2 drawdown main causes higher co2 also acts barrier co2 invasion contrary current view predict arctic ocean basin will become large atmospheric co2 sink ice-free conditions
