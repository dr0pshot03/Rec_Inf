richness human gut microbiome correlates metabolic markers
facing global metabolic health crisis provoked obesity epidemic report human gut microbial composition population sample non-obese obese danish individuals find two groups individuals differ number gut microbial genes thus gut bacterial richness contain known previously unknown bacterial species different proportions individuals low bacterial richness % population characterized marked overall adiposity insulin resistance dyslipidaemia pronounced inflammatory phenotype compared high bacterial richness individuals obese individuals among lower bacterial richness group also gain weight time bacterial species sufficient distinguish individuals high low bacterial richness even lean obese participants classifications based variation gut microbiome identify subsets individuals general white adult population may increased risk progressing adiposity-associated co-morbidities
