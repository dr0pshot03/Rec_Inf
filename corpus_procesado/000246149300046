scaling law slow earthquakes 
recently series unusual earthquake phenomena discovered including deep episodic tremor1 low-frequency earthquakes very-low-frequency earthquakes3 slow slip events4 silent earthquakes5- demonstrated arise shear slip just regular earthquakes longer characteristic durations radiating much less seismic energy show slow events follow simple unified scaling relationship clearly differentiates behaviour regular earthquakes find seismic moment proportional characteristic duration moment rate function constant spectral high-frequency decay f- scaling spectral behaviour demonstrates can thought different manifestations phenomena comprise new earthquake category observed scale dependence rupture velocity events can explained either constant low-stress drop model diffusional constant-slip model new scaling law unifies diverse class slow seismic events may lead better understanding plate subduction process large earthquake generation
