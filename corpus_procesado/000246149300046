scaling law slow earthquakes 
recently series unusual earthquake phenomena discovered including deep episodic tremor low-frequency earthquakes very-low-frequency earthquakes slow slip events silent earthquakes- demonstrated arise shear slip just regular earthquakes longer characteristic durations radiating much less seismic energy show slow events follow simple unified scaling relationship clearly differentiates behaviour regular earthquakes find seismic moment proportional characteristic duration moment rate function constant spectral high-frequency decay f- scaling spectral behaviour demonstrates can thought different manifestations phenomena comprise new earthquake category observed scale dependence rupture velocity events can explained either constant low-stress drop model diffusional constant-slip model new scaling law unifies diverse class slow seismic events may lead better understanding plate subduction process large earthquake generation
