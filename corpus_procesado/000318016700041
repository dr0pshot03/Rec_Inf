direct proteomic quantification secretome activated immune cells
protein secretion allows communication distant cells organism controls broad range physiological functions describe quantitative high-resolution mass spectrometric workflow detect quantify proteins released immune cells upon receptor ligation quantified time-resolved release proteins including annotated cytokines primary toll-like receptor activated macrophages per condition achieving low picogram sensitivity detected secreted proteins whose abundance increased factor upon stimulation secretome transcriptome comparisons revealed transcriptionally decoupled release lysosomal proteins genetic models defined secretory profiles depended distinct intracellular signaling adaptors showed secretion many proinflammatory proteins safeguarded redundant mechanisms whereas signaling adaptor synergy promoted release anti-inflammatory proteins
