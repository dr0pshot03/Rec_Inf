dissecting x-ray-emitting gas around center galaxy 
supermassive black holes smbhs accreting low levels difficult distinguish galaxy centers reside galaxys smbh provides instructive exception present close-up view quiescent x-ray emission based megaseconds chandra observations although x-ray emission elongated aligns well surrounding disk massive stars can rule concentration low-mass coronally active stars origin emission basis lack predicted iron fe k alpha emission extremely weak hydrogen h-like fe k alpha line suggests presence outflow accretion flow onto smbh results provide important constraints models prevalent radiatively inefficient accretion state
