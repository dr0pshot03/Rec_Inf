motor control sensory cortex 
classical studies mammalian movement control define prominent role primary motor cortex investigating mouse whisker system found additional equally direct pathway cortical motor control driven primary somatosensory cortex whereas activity primary motor cortex directly evokes exploratory whisker protraction primary somatosensory cortex directly drives whisker retraction providing rapid negative feedback signal sensorimotor integration motor control sensory cortex suggests need reevaluate functional organization cortical maps
