virophage origin large dna transposons 
dna transposons mobile genetic elements shaped genomes eukaryotes millions years yet origins remain obscure discovered virophage basis genetic homology likely represents evolutionary link double-stranded dna viruses maverick/polinton eukaryotic dna transposons mavirus virophage parasitizes giant cafeteria roenbergensis virus encodes predicted proteins including retroviral integrase protein-primed dna polymerase b basis data conclude maverick/polinton transposons may originated ancient relatives mavirus thereby influenced evolution eukaryotic genomes although rule alternative evolutionary scenarios
