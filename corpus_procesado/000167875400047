motion direction speed orientation binocular matching
spatial differences images seen two eyes called binocular disparities can used recover volumetric three-dimensional aspects scene computation disparity depends upon correct identification corresponding features two images understanding image features used brain solve matching problem one main issues stereoscopic vision many cortical neurons visual areas v1 ref mt refs mst refs tuned binocular disparity also tuned orientation motion direction speed although psychophysical work shown motion direction can facilitate binocular matching psychophysical literature role orientation mixed argued speed differences ineffective aiding correspondence use different psychophysical paradigm show visual system uses similarities orientation motion direction speed achieve binocular correspondence results indicate cells multiplex orientation motion direction speed binocular disparity may help solve binocular matching problem
