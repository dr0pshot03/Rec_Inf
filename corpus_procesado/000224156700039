laser-plasma accelerator producing monoenergetic electron beams 
particle accelerators used wide variety fields ranging medicine biology high-energy physics accelerating fields conventional accelerators limited tens mev m- owing material breakdown walls structure thus production energetic particle beams currently requires large-scale accelerators expensive infrastructures laser plasma accelerators proposed next generation compact accelerators huge electric fields can sustain- > gev m- however difficult use efficiently applications produced poor-quality particle beams large energy spreads- owing randomization electrons phase space demonstrate randomization can suppressed quality electron beams can dramatically enhanced within length mm laser drives plasma bubble traps accelerates plasma electrons resulting electron beam extremely collimated quasi-monoenergetic high charge nc mev
