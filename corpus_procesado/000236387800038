radio pulsar spinning hz
discovered hertz eclipsing binary radio pulsar globular cluster terzan using green bank telescope fastest spinning neutron star found date breaking year record held hertz pulsar b1937+ difficulty detecting pulsar low flux density high eclipse fraction similar % orbit suggests even faster spinning neutron stars exist pulsar mass less twice mass sun radius must constrained spin rate < kilometers short period pulsar also constrains models suggest gravitational radiation r-mode rossby wave instability limits maximum spin frequency neutron stars
