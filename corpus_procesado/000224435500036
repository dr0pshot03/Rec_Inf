synaptic computation 
neurons often considered computational engines brain synapses acting solely conveyers information diverse types synaptic plasticity range timescales operate suggest synapses active role information processing long-term changes transmission properties synapses provide physiological substrate learning memory whereas short-term changes support variety computations expressing several forms synaptic plasticity single neuron can convey array different signals neural circuit operates
