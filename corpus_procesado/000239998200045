many species herbivorous insects tropical rainforests 
despite recent progress understanding mechanisms tree species coexistence tropical forests simple explanation even extensive diversity insects feeding plants missing compared folivorous insects temperate tropical trees test hypothesis herbivore species coexistence diverse communities reflect narrow host specificity relative less diverse communities temperate tropical tree species comparable phylogenetic distribution supported similar numbers folivorous insect species +/ +/ per square meters foliage respectively host specificity differ significantly community samples indicating food resources finely partitioned among folivorous insects tropical temperate forests findings suggest latitudinal gradient insect species richness direct function plant diversity increased sevenfold temperate tropical study sites
