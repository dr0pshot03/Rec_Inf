genome sequence taurine cattle: window ruminant biology evolution 
understand biology evolution ruminants cattle genome sequenced sevenfold coverage cattle genome contains minimum genes core set orthologs shared among seven mammalian species absent undetected noneutherian marsupial monotreme genomes cattle-specific evolutionary breakpoint regions chromosomes higher density segmental duplications enrichment repetitive elements species-specific variations genes associated lactation immune responsiveness genes involved metabolism generally highly conserved although five metabolic genes deleted extensively diverged human orthologs cattle genome sequence thus provides resource understanding mammalian evolution accelerating livestock genetic improvement milk meat production
