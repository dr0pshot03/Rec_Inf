identification human brain tumour initiating cells
cancer stem cell csc hypothesis suggests neoplastic clones maintained exclusively rare fraction cells stem cell properties although existence cscs human leukaemia established little evidence exists cscs solid tumours except breast cancer recently prospectively isolated cd133+ cell subpopulation human brain tumours exhibited stem cell properties vitro however true measures cscs capacity self renewal exact recapitulation original tumour report development xenograft assay identified human brain tumour initiating cells initiate tumours vivo cd133+ brain tumour fraction contains cells capable tumour initiation nod-scid non-obese diabetic severe combined immunodeficient mouse brains injection cd133+ cells produced tumour serially transplanted phenocopy patients original tumour whereas injection cd133- cells engrafted cause tumour thus identification brain tumour initiating cells provides insights human brain tumour pathogenesis giving strong support csc hypothesis basis many solid tumours establishes previously unidentified cellular target effective cancer therapies
