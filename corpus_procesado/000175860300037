quantum control energy flow light harvesting
coherent light sources widely used control schemes exploit quantum interference effects direct outcome photochemical processes adaptive shaping laser pulses particularly powerful tool context: experimental output feedback iterative learning loop refines applied laser field render best suited constraints set experimenter approach experimentally implemented control variety processes- extent coherent excitation can also used direct dynamics complex molecular systems condensed-phase environment remains unclear report feedback-optimized coherent control energy-flow pathways light-harvesting antenna complex lh2 rhodopseudomonas acidophila photosynthetic purple bacterium show phases imprinted light field mediate branching ratio energy transfer intra intermolecular channels complexs donor-acceptor system result illustrates molecular complexity need prevent coherent control can thus extended probe affect biological functions
