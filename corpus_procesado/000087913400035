domain tnf receptors mediates ligand-independent receptor assembly signaling 
conserved domain extracellular region kilodalton tumor necrosis factor receptors tnfrs identified mediates specific ligand-independent assembly receptor trimers pre-ligand-binding assembly domain plad physically distinct domain forms major contacts ligand necessary sufficient assembly tnfr complexes bind tnf-alpha mediate signaling members tnfr superfamily including trail receptor cd40 show similar homotypic association thus tnfrs related receptors appear function preformed complexes rather individual receptor subunits oligomerize ligand binding
