dna synthesis generates terminal duplications seal end-to-end chromosome fusions
end-to-end chromosome fusions occur context telomerase deficiency can trigger genomic duplications years duplications attributed solely breakage-fusion-bridge cycles test hypothesis examined end-to-end fusions isolated caenorhabditis elegans telomere replication mutants genome-level rearrangements revealed fused chromosome ends interrupted terminal duplications accompanied template-switching events features similar disease-associated duplications interstitial segments human genome model termed fork stalling template switching proposed previously explain duplications promiscuous replication large noncontiguous segments genome occurs thus dna synthesis-based process may create duplications seal end-to-end fusions absence breakage-fusion-bridge cycles
