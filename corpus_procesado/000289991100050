spatial periodicity grid cells sustained reduced theta oscillations
grid cells parahippocampal cortices fire vertices periodic triangular grid spans entire recording environment precise neural computations space proposed emerge equally precise temporal oscillations within cells within local neural circuitry found grid-like firing patterns entorhinal cortex vanished theta oscillations reduced intraseptal lidocaine infusions rats spatially modulated cells cortical region place cells hippocampus retained spatial firing patterns larger extent periods without well-organized oscillatory neuronal activity precisely timed neural activity within single cells local networks thus required periodic spatial firing single place fields
