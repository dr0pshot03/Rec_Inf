expansion eukaryotic proteome alternative splicing 
collection components required carry intricate processes involved generating maintaining living breathing sometimes thinking organism staggeringly complex parts come early estimates stated genes required make mammal; however actual number less one-quarter barely four times number genes budding yeast now clear missing information large part provided alternative splicing process multiple different functional messenger rnas therefore proteins can synthesized single gene
