transcription-translation feedback circadian rhythm kaic phosphorylation
autoregulatory transcription-translation feedback loop thought essential generating circadian rhythms model organism cyanobacterium synechococcus elongatus essential clock protein kaic proposed form type transcriptional negative feedback nevertheless demonstrate temperature-compensated robust circadian cycling kaic phosphorylation even without kaibc messenger rna accumulation continuous dark conditions rhythm persisted presence transcription translation inhibitor moreover kinetic profiles ratio kaic autophosphorylation-dephosphorylation also temperature compensated vitro thus cyanobacterial clock can keep time independent de novo transcription translation processes
