partitioning oxygen core formation earth mars 
core formation earth mars involved physical separation metal silicate probably deep magma oceans- although core-formation models explain many aspects mantle geochemistry accounted large differences observed compositions mantles earth similar to8 wt% feo mars similar to18 wt% feo smaller mass fraction martian core- explain differences consequence solubility oxygen liquid iron-alloy increasing increasing temperature assume earth mars accreted oxidized chondritic material terrestrial magma ocean km deep high temperatures resulted extraction feo silicate magma ocean owing high solubility oxygen metal lower temperatures martian magma ocean resulted little extraction feo mantle thus remains feo-rich feo extracted earths magma ocean may contributed chemical heterogeneities lowermost mantle feo-rich d layer light element budget core
