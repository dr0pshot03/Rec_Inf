oscillatory stress stimulation uncovers achilles heel yeast mapk signaling network 
cells must interpret environmental information often changes time experiment systematically monitored growth yeast cells various frequencies oscillating osmotic stress growth severely inhibited particular resonance frequency cells show hyperactivated transcriptional stress responses behavior represents sensory misperception: cells incorrectly interpret oscillations staircase ever-increasing osmolarity misperception results capacity osmolarity-sensing mitogen-activated protein kinase mapk network retrigger sequential osmotic stresses although feature critical coping natural challenges continually increasing osmolarity results trade-off fragility non-natural oscillatory inputs match retriggering time findings demonstrate value non-natural dynamic perturbations exposing hidden sensitivities cellular regulatory networks
