monolithic carbide-derived carbon films micro-supercapacitors
microbatteries dimensions tens hundreds micrometers produced common microfabrication techniques poised provide integration power sources onto electronic devices still suffer poor cycle lifetime well power temperature range operation issues alleviated use supercapacitors reports thin-film micro-supercapacitors either thin provide sufficient energy technology scalable etching supercapacitor electrodes conductive titanium carbide substrates demonstrate monolithic carbon films lead volumetric capacity exceeding micro-and macroscale supercapacitors reported thus far factor study also provides framework integration high-performance micro-supercapacitors onto variety devices
