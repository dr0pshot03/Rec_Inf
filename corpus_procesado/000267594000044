ligand-gated chloride channels receptors biogenic amines c-elegans
biogenic amines serotonin dopamine intercellular signaling molecules function widely neurotransmitters neuromodulators identified nematode caenorhabditis elegans three ligand-gated chloride channels receptors biogenic amines: lgc high-affinity dopamine receptor lgc high-affinity tyramine receptor lgc low-affinity serotonin receptor also gated choline acetylcholine lgc mutants defective behavior requires endogenous tyramine indicates ionotropic tyramine receptor functions tyramine signaling vivo studies suggest direct activation membrane chloride conductances general mechanism action biogenic amines modulation c elegans behavior
