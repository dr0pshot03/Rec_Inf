strength stick-slip creeping subduction megathrusts heat flow observations 
subduction faults called megathrusts can generate large hazardous earthquakes mode slip seismicity megathrust controlled structural complexity fault zone however relative strength megathrust based mode slip far clear fault strength affects surface heat flow frictional heating slip model heat-flow data number subduction zones determine fault strength find smooth megathrusts produce great earthquakes tend weaker therefore dissipate less heat geometrically rough megathrusts slip mainly creeping
