transcription start regions human genome favored targets mlv integration
factors contributing retroviral integration intractable past studies precisely located genomic sites proviruses sufficient numbers significant analysis study murine leukemia virus mlv human immunodeficiency virus hiv- integrations human genome mapped data showed mlv preferred integration near start transcriptional units either upstream downstream whereas hiv preferred integration anywhere transcriptional unit upstream transcriptional start defining different integration site preferences retroviruses will important rami cations gene therapy may aid understanding factors directing integration process
