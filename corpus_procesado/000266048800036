nuclear dna base hydroxymethylcytosine present purkinje neurons brain 
despite importance epigenetic regulation neurological disorders little known neuronal chromatin cerebellar purkinje neurons large euchromatic nuclei whereas granule cell nuclei small typical heterochromatin distribution comparing abundance methylcytosine purkinje granule cell nuclei detected presence unusual dna nucleotide using thin-layer chromatography high-pressure liquid chromatography mass spectrometry identified nucleotide hydroxymethyl--deoxycytidine hmdc hmdc constitutes % total nucleotides purkinje cells % granule cells present cancer cell lines hmdc constituent nuclear dna highly abundant brain suggesting role epigenetic control neuronal function
