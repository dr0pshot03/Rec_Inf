identification active sites co oxidation water-gas shift supported pt catalysts 
identification characterization catalytic active sites prerequisites atomic-level understanding catalytic mechanism rational design high-performance heterogeneous catalysts indirect evidence recent reports suggests platinum pt single atoms exceptionally active catalytic sites demonstrate infrared spectroscopy can fast convenient characterization method directly distinguish quantify pt single atoms nanoparticles addition directly observe pt nanoparticles show activity carbon monoxide co oxidation water-gas shift low temperatures whereas pt single atoms behave spectators lack catalytic activity pt single atoms can partly attributed strong binding co molecules
