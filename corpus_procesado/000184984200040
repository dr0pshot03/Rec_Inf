genome divergence two prochlorococcus ecotypes reflects oceanic niche differentiation
marine unicellular cyanobacterium prochlorococcus smallest-known oxygen-evolving autotroph numerically dominates phytoplankton tropical subtropical oceans responsible significant fraction global photosynthesis compare genomes two prochlorococcus strains span largest evolutionary distance within prochlorococcus lineage different minimum maximum optimal light intensities growth high-light-adapted ecotype smallest genome base pairs genes known oxygenic phototroph whereas genome low-light-adapted counterpart significantly larger base pairs genes comparative architectures two strains reveal dynamic genomes constantly changing response myriad selection pressures although two strains genes common significant number shared differentially retained common ancestor acquired duplication lateral transfer genes obvious roles determining relative fitness ecotypes response key environmental variables hence regulating distribution abundance oceans
