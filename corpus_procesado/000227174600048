toll-like receptor promotes cross-priming virus-infected cells
cross-presentation cell-associated antigens plays important role regulating cd8+ t cell responses proteins expressed antigen-presenting cells apcs dendritic cells principal cross-presenting apcs vivo much progress made elucidating pathways allow dendritic cells capture process cellular material however little known signals determine whether presentation ultimately results cytotoxic t cell ctl response cross-priming cd8+ t cell inactivation cross-tolerance describe mechanism promotes cross-priming viral infections show murine cd8alpha+ dendritic cells activated double-stranded dsrna present virally infected cells absent uninfected cells dendritic cell activation requires phagocytosis infected material followed signalling dsrna receptor toll-like receptor tlr3 immunization virus-infected cells cells containing synthetic dsrna leads striking increase ctl cross-priming cell-associated antigens largely dependent tlr3 expression antigen-presenting cells thus tlr3 may evolved permit cross-priming ctls viruses directly infect dendritic cells
