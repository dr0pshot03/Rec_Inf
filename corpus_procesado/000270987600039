information causality physical principle
quantum physics remarkable distinguishing characteristics example gives probabilistic predictions non-determinism allow copying unknown states no-cloning quantum correlations may stronger classical ones information transmitted faster light no-signalling however features uniquely define quantum physics broad class theories exist share traits allow even stronger quantum correlations introduce principle information causality show respected classical quantum physics violated no-signalling theories stronger strongest quantum correlations principle relates amount information observer bob can gain data set belonging another observer alice contents completely unknown using local resources may correlated resources allowing classical communication amount information bob can recover bounded information volume m communication namely alice communicates m bits bob total information obtainable bob greater m m information causality reduces standard no-signalling principle however no-signalling theories maximally strong correlations allow bob access data m-bit subset whole data set held alice one bit sent alice m tantamount bobs able access value single bit alices data information causality may therefore help distinguish physical theories non-physical ones suggest information causality-a generalization no-signalling condition-might one foundational properties nature
