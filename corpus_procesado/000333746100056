geophysical geochemical evidence deep temperature variations beneath mid-ocean ridges 
temperature composition earths mantle control fundamental planetary properties including vigor mantle convection depths ocean basins seismic wave velocities ocean ridge depths composition mid-ocean ridge basalts can used determine variations mantle temperature composition yet typically considered isolation show correlations among three data sets consistent degrees c variation extending depths > kilometers inconsistent variations mantle composition constant temperature anomalously hot ridge segments located near hot spots confirming deep mantle-plume origin hot spot volcanism chemical heterogeneity may contribute scatter global trend coherent temperature signal provides thermal calibration scale interpreting seismic velocities located distant ridges
