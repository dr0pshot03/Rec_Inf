cytokinesis furrow positioned two consecutive signals
position cytokinesis furrow cell determines relative sizes two daughter cells well distribution contents animal cells position cytokinesis furrow specified position mitotic spindle cytokinesis furrow bisects spindle midway microtubule asters site microtubule-based midzone producing two daughter cells experiments cell types suggested midzone positions furrow experiments cells suggested asters position furrow one possibility different organisms cell types use different mechanisms position cytokinesis furrow alternative possibility asters midzone contribute furrow positioning recent work c elegans suggested centrosome separation midzone implicated cytokinesis examine relative contributions different parts mitotic spindle positioning cytokinesis furrow c elegans zygote spatially separating spindle midzone one asters using ultraviolet laser show cytokinesis furrow first positioned signal determined microtubule asters second signal derived spindle midzone thus position cytokinesis furrow specified two consecutive furrowing activities
