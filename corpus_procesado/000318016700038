melting iron earths inner core boundary based fast x-ray diffraction
earths core structured solid inner core mainly composed iron liquid outer core temperature inner core boundary expected close melting point iron gigapascal gpa despite intensive experimental theoretical efforts little consensus melting behavior iron extreme pressures temperatures present static laser-heated diamond anvil cell experiments gpa using synchrotron-based fast x-ray diffraction primary melting diagnostic extrapolating higher pressures conclude melting temperature iron inner core boundary +/ kelvin estimation favors high heat flux core-mantle boundary possible partial melting mantle
