partitioning histone h3-h4 tetramers dna replication-dependent chromatin assembly
semiconservative dna replication ensures faithful duplication genetic information cell divisions however epigenetic information carried histone modifications propagates mitotic divisions remains elusive address question dna replication-dependent nucleosome partition pattern must clarified report significant amounts h3-h4 tetramers split vivo whereas h3-h4 tetramers remained intact inhibiting dna replication-dependent deposition greatly reduced level splitting events suggests replication-independent h3 deposition pathway proceeds largely cooperatively incorporating two new h3-h4 dimers ii majority splitting events occurred replication-dependent deposition results support idea silent histone modifications within large heterochromatic regions maintained copying modifications neighboring preexisting histones without need h3-h4 splitting events
