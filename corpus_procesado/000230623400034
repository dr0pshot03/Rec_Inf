serum retinol binding protein contributes insulin resistance obesity type diabetes
obesity type diabetes expression glut4 glucose transporter decreased selectively adipocytes adipose-specific glut4 also known slc2a4 knockout adipose-glut4-/- mice show insulin resistance secondarily muscle liver show using dna arrays expression retinol binding protein rbp4 elevated adipose tissue adipose-glut4-/- mice show serum rbp4 levels elevated insulin-resistant mice humans obesity type diabetes rbp4 levels normalized rosiglitazone insulin-sensitizing drug transgenic overexpression human rbp4 injection recombinant rbp4 normal mice causes insulin resistance conversely genetic deletion rbp4 enhances insulin sensitivity fenretinide synthetic retinoid increases urinary excretion rbp4 normalizes serum rbp4 levels improves insulin resistance glucose intolerance mice obesity induced high-fat diet increasing serum rbp4 induces hepatic expression gluconeogenic enzyme phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase pepck impairs insulin signalling muscle thus rbp4 adipocyte-derived signal may contribute pathogenesis type diabetes lowering rbp4 new strategy treating type diabetes
