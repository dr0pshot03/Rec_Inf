rheological measurements thermoviscoelastic response ultrathin polymer films
measurement thermoviscoelastic behavior glass-forming liquids nanometer size range offers possibility increased understanding fundamental nature glass-transition phenomenon present results use previously unknown method characterizing rheological response nanometer-thick polymer films method relies imaging capabilities atomic force microscope reduction size classical bubble inflation method measuring biaxial creep response ultrathin polymer films creep compliance function time temperature measured linear viscoelastic regime films polyvinyl acetate thickness nanometers although little evidence change glass temperature found material exhibits previously unobserved stiffening rubbery response regime
