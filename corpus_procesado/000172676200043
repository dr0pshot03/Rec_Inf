hierarchical self-assembly metal nanostructures diblock copolymer scaffolds
self-assembly emerging elegant bottom-up method fabricating nanostructured materials- approach becomes particularly powerful ease control offered self-assembly organic components combined electronic magnetic photonic properties inorganic components demonstrate versatile hierarchical approach assembly organic-inorganic copolymer metal nanostructures one level self-assembly guides next first step ultrathin diblock copolymer films form regular scaffold highly anisotropic stripe-like domains- second assembly step differential wetting guides diffusing metal atoms aggregate selectively along scaffold producing highly organized metal nanostructures rnd contrast usual requirement near-equilibrium conditions ordering metal arranged copolymer scaffold produces highly ordered configurations system far equilibrium delineate two distinct assembly modes metal component-chains separate nanoparticles continuous wires-each characterized different ordering kinetics strikingly different current-voltage characteristics results therefore demonstrate possibility guided large-scale assembly laterally nanostructured systems
