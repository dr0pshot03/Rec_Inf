experimental evidence hillslope control landscape scale 
landscape evolution theory suggests climate sets scale landscape dissection modulating competition diffusive processes sculpt convex hillslopes advective processes carve concave valleys however link relative dominance hillslope valley transport processes landscape scale difficult demonstrate natural landscapes due episodic nature erosion report results laboratory experiments combining diffusive advective processes eroding landscape demonstrate rainsplash-driven disturbances experiments robust proxy hillslope transport increasing hillslope transport efficiency decreases drainage density experimental results demonstrate coupling climate-driven hillslope valley-forming processes bioturbation runoff dictates scale eroding landscapes
