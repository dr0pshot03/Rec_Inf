bacterial multidrug tolerance largely responsible inability antibiotics eradicate infections caused small population dormant bacteria called persisters hipa critical escherichia coli persistence factor normally neutralized hipb transcription repressor also regulates hipba expression report multiple structures hipa hipa-hipb-dna complex hipa eukaryotic serine/threonine kinase-like fold can phosphorylate translation factor ef-tu suggesting persistence mechanism via cell stasis hipa-hipb-dna structure reveals hipb-operator binding mechanism similar degrees dna bending unexpected hipa-dna contacts dimeric hipb interacts two hipa molecules inhibit kinase activity sequestration conformational inactivation combined studies suggest mechanisms hipa-mediated persistence neutralization hipb
