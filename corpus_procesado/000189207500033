atomic transient recorder
bohrs model hydrogen atom electron takes attoseconds - s orbit around proton defining characteristic timescale dynamics electronic shell atoms recording atomic transients real time requires excitation probing scale recent observation single sub-femtosecond fs - s extreme ultraviolet xuv light pulses stimulated extension techniques femtochemistry attosecond regime demonstrate generation measurement single attosecond xuv pulses use pulses excite atoms turn emit electrons intense waveform-controlled cycle laser pulse obtains tomographic images time-momentum distribution ejected electrons tomographic images primary photo electrons yield accurate information duration frequency sweep excitation pulse whereas measurements secondary auger electrons will provide insight relaxation dynamics electronic shell following excitation current similar to750-nm laser probe similar to100-ev excitation transient recorder capable resolving atomic electron dynamics within bohr orbit time
