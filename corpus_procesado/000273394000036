structure rna polymerase ii-tfiib complex transcription initiation mechanism
previous x-ray crystal structures given insight mechanism transcription role general transcription factors initiation process structure rna polymerase ii-general transcription factor tfiib complex angstrom resolution revealed amino-terminal region tfiib including loop termed b finger reaching active center polymerase may interact dna rna structure showed little carboxyl-terminal region new crystal structure complex angstrom resolution obtained different solution conditions complementary previous one revealing carboxyl-terminal region tfiib located polymerase active center cleft showing none b finger new structure linker amino-and carboxyl-terminal regions can also seen snaking cleft toward active center two structures taken together others previously obtained dispel long-standing mysteries transcription initiation process
