mammalian genes transcribed widely different bursting kinetics 
prokaryotes eukaryotes genes appear transcribed short periods called transcriptional bursts interspersed silent intervals describe bursts generate gene-specific temporal patterns messenger rna mrna synthesis mammalian cells monitor transcription high temporal resolution established various gene trap cell lines transgenic cell lines expressing short-lived luciferase protein unstable mrna recorded bioluminescence real time single cells mathematical modeling identified gene-specific on-and off-switching rates transcriptional activity mean numbers mrnas produced bursts transcriptional kinetics markedly altered cis-regulatory dna elements analysis demonstrated bursting kinetics highly gene-specific reflecting refractory periods genes stay inactive certain time switching
