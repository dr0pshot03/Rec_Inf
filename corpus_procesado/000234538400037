stability hydrous melt base earths upper mantle 
seismological observations revealed existence low-velocity high-attenuation zones discontinuity km depth base earths upper mantle12 suggested small amount melt responsible anomalies3- density silicate melt dry conditions measured high pressure46- found denser surrounding solid thereby allowing melt remain depth experimental investigation density hydrous melt yet carried present data constraining density hydrous basaltic melt pressure examine stability melt -km discontinuity infer hydrous magma formed partial melting -km discontinuity may indeed gravitationally stable thereby supporting idea low-velocity high-attentuation regions just mantle transition zone may result presence melt
