atr homolog mec1 promotes fork progression thus averting breaks replication slow zones 
budding yeast mec1 homolog mammalian atr essential protein mediates s-phase checkpoint responses meiotic recombination elimination mec1 function leads genomewide fork stalling followed chromosome breakage breaks result stochastic collapse stalled forks incidental lesions; instead occur specific regions genome g2 chromosomal transition break regions found genetically encoded replication slow zones rszs newly discovered yeast chromosomal determinant thus mec1 important functions normal s phase genome instability mec1 analogously atr-/- mutants stems defects basic roles
