comparative genomics reveals insights avian genome evolution adaptation
birds species-rich class tetrapod vertebrates wide relevance across many research fields explored bird macroevolution using full genomes avian species representing major extant clades avian genome principally characterized constrained size predominantly arose lineage-specific erosion repetitive elements large segmental deletions gene loss avian genomes furthermore show remarkably high degree evolutionary stasis levels nucleotide sequence gene synteny chromosomal structure despite pattern conservation detected many non-neutral evolutionary changes protein-coding genes noncoding regions analyses reveal pan-avian genomic diversity covaries adaptations different lifestyles convergent evolution traits
