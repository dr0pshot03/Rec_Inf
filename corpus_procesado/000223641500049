meiotic catastrophe retrotransposon reactivation male germ cells lacking dnmt3l 
mammalian genomes employ heritable cytosine methylation long-term silencing retrotransposons genes subject genomic imprinting x chromosome inactivation little known mechanisms direct cytosine methylation specific sequences show dna methyltransferase -like dnmt3l ref expressed testes brief perinatal period non-dividing precursors spermatogonial stem cells stage retrotransposons undergo de novo methylation deletion dnmt3l gene prevented de novo methylation long-terminal-repeat ltr non-ltr retrotransposons transcribed high levels spermatogonia spermatocytes loss dnmt3l early germ cells also caused meiotic failure spermatocytes express dnmt3l whereas dispersed repeated sequences demethylated mutant germ cells tandem repeats pericentric regions methylated normally result indicates dnmt3l protein might function de novo methylation dispersed repeated sequences premeiotic genome scanning process occurs male germ cells time birth
