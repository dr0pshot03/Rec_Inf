local sleep learning 
human sleep global state whose functions remain unclear much sleep cortical neurons undergo slow oscillations membrane potential appear electroencephalograms slow wave activity swa < hz1 amount swa homeostatically regulated increasing wakefulness returning baseline sleep2 suggested swa homeostasis may reflect synaptic changes underlying cellular need sleep3 inducing local synaptic changes induce local swa changes benefit neural function show sleep homeostasis indeed local component can triggered learning task involving specific brain regions furthermore show local increase swa learning correlates improved performance task sleep thus sleep homeostasis can induced local level can benefit performance
