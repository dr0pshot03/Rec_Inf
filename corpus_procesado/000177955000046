observation membrane fusion intermediate structure
report observation phase phospholipid contains structure similar commonly postulated interbilayer state crucial membrane fusion widely accepted model membrane fusion suggests intermediate state two contacting monolayers become continuous via hourglass-shaped structure called stalk many efforts made estimate free energy state order understand functionality membrane fusion proteins de ne key parameters energy estimates observation stalk structure supports stalk hypothesis membrane fusion enables measurement parameters experimentally
