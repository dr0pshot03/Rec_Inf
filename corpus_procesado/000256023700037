gelation particles short-range attraction
nanoscale colloidal particles important many realms science technology can dramatically change properties materials imparting solid-like behaviour wide variety complex fluids behaviour arises particles aggregate form mesoscopic clusters networks essential component leading aggregation interparticle attraction can generated many physical chemical mechanisms limit irreversible aggregation infinitely strong interparticle bonds lead diffusion-limited cluster aggregation dlca understood purely kinetic phenomenon can form solid-like gels arbitrarily low particle volume fraction far important technologically systems weaker attractions gel formation requires higher volume fractions numerous scenarios gelation proposed including dlca kinetic dynamic arrest- phase separation- percolation jamming consensus emerged despite ubiquity significance gelation far understood-even location gelation phase boundary agreed report experiments showing gelation spherical particles isotropic short-range attractions initiated spinodal decomposition thermodynamic instability triggers formation density fluctuations leading spanning clusters dynamically arrest create gel simple picture gelation depend microscopic system-specific details thus apply broadly particle system short range attractions results suggest gelation-often considered purely kinetic phenomenon--is fact direct consequence equilibrium liquid gas phase separation- without exception observe gelation samples predicted theory simulation phaseseparate suggests phase separation percolation corresponds gelation models attractive spheres
