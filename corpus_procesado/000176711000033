sequence-specific molecular lithography single dna molecules
recent advances realization individual molecular-scale electronic devices emphasize need novel tools concepts capable assembling devices large-scale functional circuits demonstrated sequence-specific molecular lithography substrate dna molecules harnessing homologous recombination reca protein sequence-specific manner patterned coating dna metal localized labeled molecular objects grew metal islands specific sites along dna substrate generated molecularly accurate stable dna junctions patterning dna substrate connectivity molecular lithography information encoded dna molecules replaces masks used conventional microelectronics reca protein serves resist molecular lithography works high resolution broad range length scales nanometers many micrometers
