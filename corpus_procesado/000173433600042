selective absorption processes origin puzzling spectral line polarization sun 
magnetic fields play key role astrophysical systems sun active galactic nuclei- can studied effects atomic energy levels produce polarized spectral lines particular anisotropic radiation pumping processes send electrons higher atomic levels induce population imbalances modified weak magnetic fields report peculiarly polarized light -angstrom multiplet observed coronal filament located centre solar disk show polarized light arises selective absorption ground level triplet system helium implies presence magnetic fields order gauss highly inclined respect solar radius vector disproves common belief population imbalances long-lived atomic levels insignificant presence inclined fields order gauss opens new diagnostic window investigation solar magnetic fields
