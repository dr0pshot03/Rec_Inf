myoglobin-like aerotaxis transducers archaea bacteria 
haem-containing proteins haemoglobin myoglobin play essential role oxygen transport storage comparison amino-acid sequences globins bacteria eukarya suggests share early common ancestor even though proteins perform different functions two kingdoms- now members globin family found third kingdom archaea recent studies biological signalling bacteria eukarya revealed new class haem-containing proteins serve sensors now haem-based sensor described archaea report first myoglobin-like haem-containing protein archaea first haem-based aerotactic transducer bacteria termed hemat-hs archaeon halobacterium salinarum hemat-bs bacillus subtilis proteins exhibit spectral properties similar myoglobin trigger aerotactic responses
