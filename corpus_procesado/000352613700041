strong water isotopic anomalies martian atmosphere: probing current ancient reservoirs
measured maps atmospheric water h2o deuterated form hdo across martian globe showing strong isotopic anomalies significant high deuterium/hydrogen d/h enrichment indicative great water loss maps sample evolution sublimation north polar cap revealing released water representative d/h value enriched factor relative earths ocean [vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow] certain basins orographic depressions show even higher enrichment whereas high-altitude regions show much lower values vsmow atmospheric maps indicate water ice polar reservoirs enriched deuterium least vsmow mean early mars billion years ago global equivalent water layer least meters deep
