total synthesis --cyanthiwigin f means double catalytic enantioselective alkylation 
double catalytic enantioselective transformations powerful synthetic methods can facilitate construction stereochemically complex molecules single operation addition generating two stereocentres single reaction multiple asymmetric reactions also impart increased enantiomeric excess final product comparison analogous single transformation- furthermore multiple asymmetric operations potential independently construct several stereocentres remote points within molecular scaffold rather relying pre existing chiral centres proximal reactive site despite inherent benefits multiple catalytic enantioselective reactions application natural product total synthesis remains largely underutilized report use double stereoablative enantioselective alkylation reaction concise synthesis marine diterpenoid -cyanthiwigin f ref employing technique independent selective formation two stereocentres single stereoconvergent operation demonstrate complicated mixture racemic meso diastereomers may smoothly converted synthetically useful intermediate exceptional enantiomeric excess stereochemical information generated means catalytic transformation facilitates easy rapid completion total synthesis marine natural product
