protein native-state stabilization placing aromatic side chains n-glycosylated reverse turns 
n-glycosylation eukaryotic proteins helps fold traverse cellular secretory pathway can increase stability although molecular basis stabilization poorly understood glycosylation proteins naive sites ones normally glycosylated useful therapeutic research applications currently results unpredictable changes protein stability show placing phenylalanine residue two three positions glycosylated asparagine distinct reverse turns facilitates stabilizing interactions aromatic side chain first n-acetylglucosamine glycan glycosylating portable structural module enhanced aromatic sequon three different proteins stabilizes native states kilocalories per mole increases cellular glycosylation efficiency
