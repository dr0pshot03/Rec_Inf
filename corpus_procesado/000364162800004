early maven deep dip campaign reveals thermosphere ionosphere variability
mars atmosphere volatile evolution maven mission second deep dip campaigns made comprehensive measurements martian thermosphere ionosphere composition structure variability altitudes similar kilometers subsolar region altitude range contains diffusively separated upper atmosphere just well-mixed atmosphere layer peak extreme ultraviolet heating primary reservoir atmospheric escape situ measurements upper atmosphere reveal previously unmeasured populations neutral charged particles homopause altitude approximately kilometers unexpected level variability orbit-to-orbit basis within individual orbits observations help constrain volatile escape processes controlled thermosphere ionosphere structure variability
