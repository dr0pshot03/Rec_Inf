light echoes ancient supernovae large magellanic cloud
light historical supernovae principle still visible scattered-light echoes centuries explosion- detection light echoes allow us pinpoint supernova event position age importantly permit acquisition spectra determine type supernova centuries direct light explosion first reached earth although echoes discovered around nearby extragalactic supernovae- targeted searches found echoes regions historical galactic supernovae- report three faint variable-surface-brightness complexes high apparent proper motions pointing back three six smallest probably youngest previously catalogued supernova remnants large magellanic cloud believed thermonuclear type ia supernovae using distance apparent proper motions echo arcs estimate ages years two
