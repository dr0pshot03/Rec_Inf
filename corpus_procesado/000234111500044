light echoes ancient supernovae large magellanic cloud 
light historical supernovae principle still visible scattered-light echoes centuries explosion1- detection light echoes allow us pinpoint supernova event position age importantly permit acquisition spectra determine type supernova centuries direct light explosion first reached earth although echoes discovered around nearby extragalactic supernovae7- targeted searches found echoes regions historical galactic supernovae14- report three faint variable-surface-brightness complexes high apparent proper motions pointing back three six smallest probably youngest previously catalogued supernova remnants large magellanic cloud believed thermonuclear type ia supernovae17 using distance apparent proper motions echo arcs estimate ages years two
