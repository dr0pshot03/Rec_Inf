human ctip promotes dna end resection 
s g2 phases cell cycle dna double-strand breaks dsbs processed single-stranded dna triggering atr-dependent checkpoint signalling dsb repair homologous recombination previous work implicated mre11 complex dsb-processing events show human ctip rbbp8 protein confers resistance dsb-inducing agents recruited dsbs exclusively s g2 cell-cycle phases moreover reveal ctip required dsb resection thereby recruitment replication protein rpa protein kinase atr dsbs ensuing atr activation furthermore establish ctip physically functionally interacts mre11 complex ctip mre11 required efficient homologous recombination finally reveal ctip sequence homology sae2 involved mre11-dependent dsb processing yeast findings establish evolutionarily conserved roles ctip-like proteins controlling dsb resection checkpoint signalling homologous recombination
