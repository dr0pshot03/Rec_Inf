wnt11 acts directional cue organize elongation early muscle fibres 
early vertebrate skeletal muscle well organized tissue primitive muscle fibres myocytes parallel aligned along antero posterior axis embryo myofibres acquire orientation development unknown show early chick myogenesis wnt11 essential role oriented elongation myocytes find neural tube known drive wnt11 expression medial border somites1 necessary sufficient orient myocyte elongation show specific inhibition wnt11 function somites leads disorganization myocytes establish wnt11 mediates effect evolutionary conserved planar cell polarity pcp pathway downstream wnt/beta-catenin-dependent pathway required initiate myogenic program myocytes wnt11 expression finally demonstrate localized ectopic source wnt11 can markedly change orientation myocytes indicating wnt11 acts directional cue process together data show sequential action wnt/ pcp wnt/beta-catenin pathways necessary formation fully functional embryonic muscle fibres study also provides evidence wnts can act instructive cues regulate pcp pathway vertebrates
