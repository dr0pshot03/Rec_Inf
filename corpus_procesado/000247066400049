genome-wide mapping vivo protein-dna interactions 
vivo protein-dna interactions connect transcription factor direct targets form gene network scaffold map protein-dna interactions comprehensively across entire mammalian genomes developed large-scale chromatin immunoprecipitation assay chipseq based direct ultrahigh-throughput dna sequencing sequence census method used map vivo binding neuron-restrictive silencer factor nrsf; also known rest repressor element- silencing transcription factor locations human genome data display sharp resolution binding position [ +/ base pairs bp] facilitated finding motifs allowed us identify noncanonical nrsf-binding motifs chipseq data also high sensitivity specificity [ roc receiver operator characteristic area > ] statistical confidence p < - properties important inferring new candidate interactions include key transcription factors gene network regulates pancreatic islet cell development
