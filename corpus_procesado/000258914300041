internally generated cell assembly sequences rat hippocampus
long standing conjecture neuroscience aspects cognition depend brains ability self generate sequential neuronal activity found reliably continually changing cell assemblies rat hippocampus appeared spatial navigation also absence changing environmental body derived inputs delay period memory task moment time characterized activity particular assembly neurons identical initial conditions triggered similar assembly sequence whereas different conditions gave rise different sequences thereby predicting behavioral choices including errors sequences formed control nonmemory tasks hypothesize neuronal representations evolved encoding distance spatial navigation also support episodic recall planning action sequences
