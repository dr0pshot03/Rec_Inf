dmy y-specific dm-domain gene required male development medaka fish 
although sex-determining gene sry identified mammals1 comparable genes found non-mammalian vertebrates used recombinant breakpoint analysis restrict sex-determining region medaka fish oryzias latipes -kilobase kb stretch y chromosome deletion analysis y chromosome congenic xy female shortened region kb shotgun sequencing region predicted genes three genes expressed sexual differentiation however dm-related2 pg17 y specific; thus named dmy two naturally occurring mutations establish dmys critical role male development first heritable mutant-a single insertion exon subsequent truncation dmy-resulted xy female offspring similarly second xy mutant female showed reduced dmy expression high proportion xy female offspring normal development dmy expressed somatic cells xy gonads findings strongly suggest sex-specific dmy required testicular development prime candidate medaka sex-determining gene
