potassium channel protein encoded chlorella virus pbcv- 
large chlorella virus pbcv- contains double-stranded dna dsdna encodes codon open reading frame orf contains motif resembling signature sequence pore domain potassium channel proteins phylogenetic analyses encoded protein kcv indicate previously unidentified type potassium channel messenger rna encoded orf leads functional expression potassium-selective conductance xenopus laevis oocytes channel blockers amantadine barium cesium inhibit conductance addition virus plaque formation thus pbcv encodes first known viral protein functions potassium-selective channel essential virus life cycle
