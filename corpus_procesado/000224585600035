genome duplication teleost fish tetraodon nigroviridis reveals early vertebrate proto-karyotype 
tetraodon nigroviridis freshwater puffer fish smallest known vertebrate genome report draft genome sequence long-range linkage substantial anchoring tetraodon chromosomes genome analysis provides greatly improved fish gene catalogue including identifying key genes previously thought absent fish comparison vertebrates urochordate indicates fish proteins diverged markedly faster mammalian homologues comparison human genome suggests similar to900 previously unannotated human genes analysis tetraodon human genomes shows whole-genome duplication occurred teleost fish lineage subsequent divergence mammals analysis also makes possible infer basic structure ancestral bony vertebrate genome composed chromosomes reconstruct much evolutionary history ancient recent chromosome rearrangements leading modern human karyotype
