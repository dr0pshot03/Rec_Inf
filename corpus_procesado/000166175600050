telomere looping permits gene activation downstream uas yeast 
yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae transcriptional activators gal4 gal4-vp16 work ordinarily sites located upstream activating sequence uas positioned base pairs upstream transcription start site1 contrast behaviour mammalian cells however activators fail work positioned distances greater similar - base pairs upstream2 anywhere downstream34 gene show yeast gene bearing enhancer positioned - kilobases downstream gene activated reporter linked telomere positioned internal chromosomal locus observations explained finding yeast telomeres form back-folding looped structures yeast telomeric regions resemble heterochromatin found higher eukaryotes findings might also explain transcription higher eukaryotic genes depends location heterochromatin
