regional co2-c- offsets troposphere: magnitude mechanisms consequences 
radiocarbon dating methods typically assume significant tropospheric co2-c- gradients within low mid-latitude zone northern hemisphere comparison tree ring c- data southern germany anatolia supports assumption general also documents episodes significant short-term regional co2-c- offsets suggest offset caused enhanced seasonal co2-c- cycle seasonally peaked flux stratospheric c- troposphere periods low solar magnetic activity coinciding substantial atmospheric cooling short-term episodes regional co2-c- offsets important palaeoclimate studies high-resolution archaeological dating
