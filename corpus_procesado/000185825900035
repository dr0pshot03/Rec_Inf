protein conformational dynamics probed single-molecule electron transfer 
electron transfer used probe angstrom-scale structural changes single protein molecules flavin reductase fluorescence flavin quenched nearby tyrosine residue means photo-induced electron transfer probing fluorescence lifetime single flavin photon-by-photon basis able observe variation flavin-tyrosine distance time determine potential mean force flavin tyrosine correlation analysis revealed conformational fluctuation multiple time scales spanning hundreds microseconds seconds phenomenon suggests existence multiple interconverting conformers related fluctuating catalytic reactivity
