isotope fractionation silicate melts thermal diffusion 
phenomenon thermal diffusion mass diffusion driven temperature gradient known ludwig-soret effect investigated years understanding underlying physical basis remains elusive significant hurdle studying thermal diffusion difficulty characterizing extensive experiments past century established soret coefficient st single parameter describes steady-state result thermal diffusion highly sensitive many factors- sensitivity makes difficult obtain robust characterization thermal diffusion even single material show thermal diffusion experiments span wide range composition temperature difference st isotopes diffusing elements network modifiers iron calcium magnesium independent composition temperature basis finding propose additive decomposition functional form st argue theoretical approach based local thermodynamic equilibrium holds promise describing thermal diffusion silicate melts complex solutions results lead simple robust framework characterizing isotope fractionation thermal diffusion natural synthetic systems
