quantum dynamics d-wave josephson junction 
present direct observation macroscopic quantum properties high-critical-temperature superconductor d-wave josephson junction although dissipation caused low-energy excitations expected strongly suppress macroscopic quantum effects demonstrate energy level quantization d-wave josephson junction result indicates role dissipation mechanisms high-temperature superconductors revised may also consequences class solid-state "quiet" quantum bits superior coherence time
