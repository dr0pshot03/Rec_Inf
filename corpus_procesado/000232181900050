structure ptb bound rna: specific binding implications splicing regulation
polypyrimidine tract binding protein ptb kilodalton rna binding protein involved multiple aspects messenger rna metabolism including repression alternative exons determined solution structures four rna binding domains rbds ptb bound cucucu oligonucleotide rbd binds rna different binding specificity rbd3 rbd4 interact resulting antiparallel orientation bound rnas thus ptb will induce rna looping bound two separated pyrimidine tracts within rna leads structural models ptb functions alternative-splicing repressor
