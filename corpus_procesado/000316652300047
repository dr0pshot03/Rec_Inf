deep chemically reducing parts earths mantle1 hydrous fluids contain significant amounts molecular hydrogen h- thermodynamic models fluids earths mantle far always assumed molecular hydrogen water completely miscible show experimental evidence water hydrogen can coexist two separate immiscible phases immiscibility water hydrogen may cause formation enigmatic ultra-reducing domains mantle contain moissanite sic phases indicative extremely reducing conditions23 moreover immiscibility water hydrogen may provide mechanism rapid oxidation earths upper mantle immediately following core formation4
