matrix proteins can generate higher order architecture golgi apparatus 
golgi apparatus animal cells comprises reticulum linked stacks pericentriolar often juxtanuclear regions cell unique architecture organelle thought depend cytoskeleton cytoplasmic matrix proteins-the best characterized golgin family fibrous coiled-coil proteins grasp family stacking proteins- show matrix proteins can separated oligosaccharide-modifying enzymes golgi stack without affecting ability form ribbon-like reticulum correct location near nucleus data suggest golgi structural scaffold can exist independently normally populated enzyme-containing membranes modify transiting cargo new concept golgi indicates golgi may autonomous organelle rather one simple dynamic equilibrium endoplasmic reticulum
