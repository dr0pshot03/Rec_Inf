multisite phosphorylation cdk inhibitor sets threshold onset dna replication 
scf ubiquitin ligases target phosphorylated substrates ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis means adapter subunits called f-box proteins f-box protein cdc4 captures phosphorylated forms cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor sic1 ubiquitination late g1 phase event necessary onset dna replication wd40 repeat domain cdc4 binds high affinity consensus phosphopeptide motif cdc4 phospho-degron cpd yet sic1 many sub-optimal cpd motifs act concert mediate cdc4 binding weak cpd sites sic1 establish phosphorylation threshold delays degradation vivo thereby establishes minimal g1 phase period needed ensure proper dna replication multisite phosphorylation may general mechanism set thresholds regulated protein-protein interactions
