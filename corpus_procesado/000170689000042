transition mount etna lavas mantle-plume island-arc magmatic source
mount etna lies near boundary two regions exhibit significantly different types volcanism north volcanism aeolian island arc thought related subduction ionian lithosphere sicily however chemical seismological evidence subduction-related volcanism exists thought volcanism-including mount etna itself-stems upwelling mantle material associated various surface tectonic processes paucity geological evidence regarding primary composition magma mount etna means source characteristics remain controversial characterize trace-element composition series lavas emitted mount etna past kyr preserved melt inclusions inside olivine phenocrysts show compositional change primary magmas mount etna reflects progressive transition predominantly mantle-plume source one greater contribution island-arc subduction-related basalts suggest associated southward migration ionian slab becoming juxtaposed mantle plume beneath sicily implies volcanism mount etna become calc-alkaline hence explosive evolution
