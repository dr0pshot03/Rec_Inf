chronic lymphocytic inflammation specifies organ tropism prions
prions typically accumulate nervous lymphoid tissues proinflammatory cytokines immune cells required lymphoid prion replication tested whether inflammatory conditions affect prion pathogenesis administered prions mice five inflammatory diseases kidney pancreas liver cases chronic lymphocytic inflammation enabled prion accumulation otherwise prion-free organs inflammatory foci consistently correlated lymphotoxin up-regulation ectopic induction fdc-m1+ cells expressing normal cellular prion protein prpc contrast inflamed organs mice lacking lymphotoxin-alpha receptor accumulate abnormal isoform prpsc display infectivity upon prion inoculation expanding tissue distribution prions chronic inflammatory conditions may act modifiers natural iatrogenic prion transmission
