geomagnetic dipole strength reversal rate past two million years 
independent records relative magnetic palaeointensity sediment cores different areas world can stacked together extract evolution geomagnetic dipole moment12 thus provide information regarding processes governing geodynamo far procedure limited past years kyr; ref include geomagnetic reversals present composite curve shows evolution dipole moment past two million years reconstruction good agreement absolute dipole moments derived volcanic lavas used calibration show least period time-averaged field higher periods without reversals amplitude short-term oscillations remained consequence intervals low intensity thus fewer instabilities expected periods strong average dipole moment whereas excursions reversals expected periods weak field intensity also observe axial dipole begins decay kyr reversals rebuilds opposite direction thousand years
