impaired thermosensation mice lacking trpv3 heat camphor sensor skin
environmental temperature thought directly sensed neurons projections skin subset mammalian transient receptor potential trp family ion channels implicated process thermotrps activated distinct temperature thresholds typically expressed sensory neurons trpv3 activated heat >33degreesc unlike thermotrps expressed mouse keratinocytes found trpv3 null mice strong deficits responses innocuous noxious heat sensory modalities hence trpv3 specific role thermosensation natural compound camphor modulates sensations warmth humans proved specific activator trpv3 camphor activated cultured primary keratinocytes sensory neurons activity abolished trpv3 null mice therefore heat-activated receptors keratinocytes important mammalian thermosensation
