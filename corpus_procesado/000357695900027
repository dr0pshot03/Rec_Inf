glypican identifies cancer exosomes detects early pancreatic cancer
exosomes lipid-bilayer-enclosed extracellular vesicles contain proteins nucleic acids secreted cells circulate blood specific detection isolation cancer-cell-derived exosomes circulation currently lacking using mass spectrometry analyses identify cell surface proteoglycan glypican gpc1 specifically enriched cancer-cell-derived exosomes gpc11 circulating exosomes crexos monitored isolated using flow cytometry serum patients mice cancer gpc11 crexos detected serum patients pancreatic cancer absolute specificity sensitivity distinguishing healthy subjects patients benign pancreatic disease patients early-and late-stage pancreatic cancer levels gpc11 crexos correlate tumour burden survival pre-and post-surgical patients gpc11 crexos patients mice spontaneous pancreatic tumours carry specific kras mutations reliably detect pancreatic intraepithelial lesions mice despite negative signals magnetic resonance imaging gpc11 crexos may serve potential non-invasive diagnostic screening tool detect early stages pancreatic cancer facilitate possible curative surgical therapy
