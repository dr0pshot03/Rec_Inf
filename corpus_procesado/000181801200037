energetic stellar outburst accompanied circumstellar light echoes
classes stars including novae supernovae undergo explosive outbursts eject stellar material space previously unknown variable star v838 monocerotis brightened suddenly factor similar to10 unlike supernova nova explosively eject outer layers rather simply expanded become cool supergiant moderate-velocity stellar wind superluminal light echoes discovered light outburst propagated surrounding pre-existing circumstellar dust report high-resolution imaging polarimetry light echoes allow us set direct geometric distance limits object distance > kpc v838 mon maximum brightness temporarily brightest star milky way presence circumstellar dust implies previous eruptions occurred spectra show binary system combined high luminosity unusual outburst behaviour characteristics indicate v838 mon represents hitherto unknown type stellar outburst completely satisfactory physical explanation
