molecular architecture evolution modular spider silk protein gene 
spider flagelliform silk one elastic natural materials known extensive sequencing spider silk genes shown exons introns flagelliform gene underwent intragenic concerted evolution intron sequences homogenized within species exons pattern can explained extreme mutation recombination pressures internally repetitive exons iterated sequences within exons encode protein structures critical function silks therefore attributes make silks exceptional biomaterials may also hinder fixation optimally adapted protein sequences
