positive feedback pu1 cell cycle controls myeloid differentiation 
regulatory gene circuits positive-feedback loops control stem cell differentiation several mechanisms can contribute positive feedback dissect feedback mechanisms transcription factor pu1 controls lymphoid myeloid differentiation quantitative live-cell imaging revealed developing b cells decrease pu1 levels reducing pu1 transcription whereas developing macrophages increase pu1 levels lengthening cell cycles causes stable pu1 accumulation exogenous pu1 expression progenitors increases endogenous pu1 levels inducing cell cycle lengthening implying positive feedback regulatory factor cell cycle mathematical modeling showed cell cycle-coupled feedback architecture effectively stabilizes slow-dividing differentiated state results show cell cycle duration functions integral part positive autoregulatory circuit control cell fate
