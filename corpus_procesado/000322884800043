positive feedback pu cell cycle controls myeloid differentiation 
regulatory gene circuits positive-feedback loops control stem cell differentiation several mechanisms can contribute positive feedback dissect feedback mechanisms transcription factor pu controls lymphoid myeloid differentiation quantitative live-cell imaging revealed developing b cells decrease pu levels reducing pu transcription whereas developing macrophages increase pu levels lengthening cell cycles causes stable pu accumulation exogenous pu expression progenitors increases endogenous pu levels inducing cell cycle lengthening implying positive feedback regulatory factor cell cycle mathematical modeling showed cell cycle-coupled feedback architecture effectively stabilizes slow-dividing differentiated state results show cell cycle duration functions integral part positive autoregulatory circuit control cell fate
