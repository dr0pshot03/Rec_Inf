osmium isotope heterogeneity constituent phases mid-ocean ridge basalts 
radiogenic isotope variations mid-ocean ridge basalts morb commonly attributed compositional variations earths upper mantle rhenium-osmium isotope system constituent morb phases shown possess exceptionally high re/os parent/daughter ratios consequently radiogenic os produced decay re short periods time thus absence precise age constraints os isotope variations unambiguously attributed source although re-os isotope data constituent minerals can yield crystallization ages details equilibration initial os isotope values relate directly mantle source
