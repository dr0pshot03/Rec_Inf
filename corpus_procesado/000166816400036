generic mechanism generating liquid-liquid phase transition
recent experimental results indicate phosphorus-a single component system-can high-density liquid hdl low-density liquid ldl phase first-order transition two liquids different densities consistent experimental data variety materials including single-component systems water- silica carbon molecular dynamics simulations specific models supercooled water liquid carbon supercooled silica predict ldl-hdl critical point coherent general interpretation ldl-hdl transition lacking show presence ldl hdl can directly related interaction potential attractive part two characteristic short-range repulsive distances kind interaction common single-component materials liquid state particular liquid metals- potentials often used describe systems exhibit density anomaly however results show ldl hdl phases can occur systems density anomaly results therefore present experimental challenge uncover liquid-liquid transition systems like liquid metals regardless presence density anomaly
