egg cell-secreted ec1 triggers sperm cell activation double fertilization 
double fertilization defining characteristic flowering plants however molecular mechanisms regulating fusion one sperm egg second sperm central cell largely unknown show gamete interactions arabidopsis depend small cysteine-rich ec1 egg cell proteins accumulating storage vesicles egg cell upon sperm arrival ec1-containing vesicles exocytosed sperm endomembrane system responds exogenously applied ec1 peptides redistributing potential gamete fusogen hap2/gcs1 hapless /generative cell specific cell surface furthermore fertilization studies ec1 quintuple mutants show successful male-female gamete interactions necessary prevent multiple-sperm cell delivery findings provide evidence mutual gamete activation regulated exocytosis sperm plasma membrane modifications govern flowering plant gamete interactions
