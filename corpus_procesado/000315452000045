interferon-epsilon protects female reproductive tract viral bacterial infection 
innate immune system senses pathogens pattern-recognition receptors prrs signal induce effector cytokines type interferons ifns characterized ifn-epsilon type ifn signaled via ifnar1 ifnar2 receptors induce ifn-regulated genes contrast type ifns ifn-epsilon induced known prr pathways; instead ifn-epsilon constitutively expressed epithelial cells female reproductive tract frt hormonally regulated ifn-epsilon-deficient mice increased susceptibility infection frt common sexually transmitted infections stis herpes simplex virus chlamydia muridarum thus ifn-epsilon potent antipathogen immunoregulatory cytokine may important combating stis represent major global health socioeconomic burden
