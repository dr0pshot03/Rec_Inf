ocean currents mediate evolution island lizards 
islands considered natural laboratories examine evolution implicit assumption limited gene flow allows tests evolutionary processes isolated replicates show well-accepted idea requires re-examination island inundation hurricanes can devastating effects lizard populations bahamas severe storms islands may recolonized overwater dispersal lizards neighbouring islands high levels gene flow may homogenize genes responsible divergence widely viewed constraining force evolution ultimately magnitude gene flow determines extent populations diverge one another whether eventually form new species show patterns gene flow among island populations anolis lizards best explained prevailing ocean currents over-water dispersal evolutionary consequences across islands divergence fitness-related morphology decreases increasing gene flow results suggest over-water dispersal hurricanes constrains adaptive diversification anolis lizards may important previously undocumented role classical example adaptive radiation
