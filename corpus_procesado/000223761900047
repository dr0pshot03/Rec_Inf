reverse methanogenesis: testing hypothesis environmental genomics
microbial methane consumption anoxic sediments significantly impacts global environment reducing flux greenhouse gases ocean atmosphere despite significance biological mechanisms controlling anaerobic methane oxidation well characterized one current model suggests relatives methane-producing archaea developed capacity reverse methanogenesis thereby consume methane produce cellular carbon energy report test reverse-methanogenesis hypothesis genomic analyses methane-oxidizing archaea deep-sea sediments results show nearly genes typically associated methane production present one specific group archaeal methanotrophs genome-based observations support previous hypotheses provide informed foundation metabolic modeling anaerobic methane oxidation
