nora bh3-only member bcl family candidate mediator p53-induced apoptosis
critical function tumor suppressor p53 induction apoptosis cells exposed noxious stresses report previously unidentified pro-apoptotic gene nora expression nora induction primary mouse cells exposed x-ray irradiation dependent p53 nora encodes bcl homology bh3-only member bcl family proteins member contains bh3 region bh domains ectopically expressed nora underwent bh3 motif-dependent localization mitochondria interacted anti-apoptotic bcl family members resulting activation caspase- also demonstrate blocking endogenous nora induction results suppression apoptosis nora may thus represent mediator p53-dependent apoptosis
