20th-century industrial black carbon emissions altered arctic climate forcing
black carbon bc biomass fossil fuel combustion alters chemical physical properties atmosphere snow albedo yet little known emission deposition histories measurements bc vanillic acid non-sea-salt sulfur ice cores indicate sources concentrations bc greenland precipitation varied greatly since result boreal forest fires industrial activities beginning industrial emissions resulted sevenfold increase ice-core bc concentrations change occurring winter bc concentrations lower increasing maximum estimated surface climate forcing early summer bc arctic snow watts per square meter eight times typical preindustrial forcing value
