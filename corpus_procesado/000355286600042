counteraction antibiotic production degradation stabilizes microbial communities 
major challenge theoretical ecology understanding natural microbial communities support species diversity1- particular antibiotic-producing sensitive resistant species coexist9- cyclic rock-paper-scissors interactions can stabilize communities spatial environments9- coexistence unstructured environments remains unexplained1216 using simulations analytical models show opposing actions antibiotic production degradation enable coexistence even well-mixed environments coexistence depends three-way interactions antibiotic-degrading species attenuates inhibitory interactions two species interactions enable coexistence robust substantial differences inherent species growth rates invasion cheating species cease produce degrade antibiotics least two antibiotics required stability greater numbers antibiotics enabling complex communities diverse dynamic behaviours ranging stable fixed points limit cycles chaos together results show multi-species antibiotic interactions can generate ecological stability spatially structured mixed microbial communities suggesting strategies engineering synthetic ecosystems highlighting importance toxin production degradation microbial biodiversity
