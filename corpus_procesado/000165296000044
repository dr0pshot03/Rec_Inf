repeated recent diverse transfers mitochondrial gene nucleus flowering plants 
central component endosymbiotic theory bacterial origin mitochondrion many genes transferred nucleus transfer occurred early mitochondrial evolution functional transfer mitochondrial genes ceased animals although mitochondrial gene transfer continues occur plants comprehensive study frequency timing transfers plant evolution conducted report frequent loss times transfer nucleus mitochondrial gene rps10 among diverse angiosperms characterization nuclear rps10 genes loss lineages implies many independent rna-mediated rps10 transfers occurred recent angiosperm evolution genes may represent separate functional gene transfer thus rps10 transferred nucleus surprisingly high rate angiosperm evolution structures several nuclear rps10 genes reveal diverse mechanisms transferred genes become activated including parasitism pre-existing nuclear genes mitochondrial cytoplasmic proteins activation without gain mitochondrial targeting sequence
