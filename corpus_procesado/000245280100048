top-down versus bottom-up control attention prefrontal posterior parietal cortices 
attention can focused volitionally "top-down" signals derived task demands automatically "bottom-up" signals salient stimuli frontal parietal cortices involved neural activity directly compared therefore recorded simultaneously monkeys prefrontal neurons reflected target location first top-down attention whereas parietal neurons signaled earlier bottom-up attention synchrony frontal parietal areas stronger lower frequencies top-down attention higher frequencies bottom-up attention result indicates top-down bottom-up signals arise frontal sensory cortex respectively different modes attention may emphasize synchrony different frequencies
