maternal oxytocin triggers transient inhibitory switch gaba signaling fetal brain delivery 
report signaling mechanism rats mother fetus aimed preparing fetal neurons delivery immature neurons gamma-aminobutyric acid gaba primary excitatory neurotransmitter found shortly delivery transient reduction intracellular chloride concentration excitatory-to-inhibitory switch gaba actions events triggered oxytocin essential maternal hormone labor vivo administration oxytocin receptor antagonist delivery prevented switch gaba actions fetal neurons aggravated severity anoxic episodes thus maternal oxytocin inhibits fetal neurons increases resistance insults delivery
