active disruption rna-protein interaction dexh/d rna helicase 
aspects cellular rna metabolism replication many viruses require dexh/d proteins manipulate rna manner requires nucleoside triphosphates although dexh/d proteins shown unwind purified rna duplexes rna molecules cellular environment complexed proteins therefore speculated dexh/d proteins may also affect rna-protein interactions demonstrate dexh protein nph-ii vaccinia virus can displace protein u1a rna active adenosine triphosphate-dependent fashion nph-ii increases rate u1a dissociation three orders magnitude retaining helicase processivity indicates dexh/d proteins can effectively catalyze protein displacement rna thereby participate structural reorganization ribonucleoprotein assemblies
