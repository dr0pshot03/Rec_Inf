electron localization following attosecond molecular photoionization
past several decades able directly probe motion atoms associated chemical transformations occurs femtosecond --s timescale however studying inner workings atoms molecules electronic timescale- become possible recent development isolated attosecond --s laser pulses pulses used investigate atomic photoexcitation photoionization electron dynamics solids molecules help explore prompt charge redistribution localization accompany photoexcitation processes recent work dissociative ionization h d monitored femtosecond timescales controlled using few-cycle near-infrared laser pulses report molecular attosecond pump-probe experiment based work: h d dissociatively ionized sequence comprising isolated attosecond ultraviolet pulse intense few-cycle infrared pulse localization electronic charge distribution within molecule measured depends-with attosecond time resolution-on delay pump probe pulses localization occurs means two mechanisms infrared laser influences photoionization dissociation molecular ion first case charge localization arises quantum mechanical interference involving autoionizing states laser-altered wavefunction departing electron second case charge localization arises owing laser-driven population transfer different electronic states molecular ion results establish attosecond pump-probe strategies powerful tool investigating complex molecular dynamics result coupling electronic nuclear motions beyond usual born-oppenheimer approximation
