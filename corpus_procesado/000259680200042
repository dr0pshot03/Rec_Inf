atmospheric co2 climate millennial time scales last glacial period 
reconstructions ancient atmospheric carbon dioxide co2 variations help us better understand global carbon cycle climate linked compared co2 variations millennial time scales years ago antarctic temperature proxy records abrupt climate change northern hemisphere co2 concentration antarctic temperature positively correlated millennial scale climate cycles implying strong connection southern ocean processes evidence marine sediment proxies indicates co2 concentration rose rapidly north atlantic deep water shoaled stratification southern ocean reduced increases co2 concentration occurred stadial cold periods northern hemisphere several thousand years abrupt warming events greenland
