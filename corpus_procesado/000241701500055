movement gating charge coupled ligand binding g-protein-coupled receptor
activation agonist binding g-protein-coupled receptors gpcrs controls signal transduction processes although receptors span cell membrane considered voltage sensitive recently shown activity gpcrs- affinity towards agonists regulated membrane potential however remains unclear whether gpcrs intrinsically respond changes membrane potential show two prototypical gpcrs m2 m1 muscarinic receptors m2r m1r display charge-movement-associated currents analogous gating currents voltage-gated channels gating charge voltage relationship m2r correlates well voltage dependence affinity receptor acetylcholine loop couples m2r m1r g protein crucial function coupling voltage sensing agonist-binding affinity data strongly indicate gpcrs serve sensors transmembrane potential external chemical signals
