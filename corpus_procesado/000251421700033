fine thermal structure coronal active region
determination fine thermal structure solar corona fundamental constraining coronal heating mechanisms hinode x-ray telescope collected images solar corona different passbands thus providing temperature diagnostics energy ratios combining different filters optimize signal-to-noise ratio observed coronal active region five filters revealing highly thermally structured corona: fine structures core region larger scale away observed continuous thermal distribution along coronal loops well entangled structures variations thermal structuring along line sight
