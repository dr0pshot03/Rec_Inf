spatial bistability dpp-receptor interactions drosophila dorsal-ventral patterning 
many developmental contexts locally produced morphogen specifies positional information forming concentration gradient field cells1 however embryonic dorsal ventral patterning drosophila two members bone morphogenetic protein bmp family decapentaplegic dpp screw scw broadly transcribed promote receptor-mediated signalling restricted subset expressing cells2- use novel immunostaining protocol visualize receptor-bound bmps show proteins become localized sharp stripe dorsal cells demonstrate proper bmp localization involves two distinct processes first dpp undergoes directed long-range extracellular transport scw also undergoes long-range movement can independently dpp transport second intracellular positive feedback circuit promotes future ligand binding function previous signalling strength data elicit model extracellular dpp transport initially creates shallow gradient bmp binding acted positive intracellular feedback produce two stable states bmp receptor interactions spatial bistability bmp binding signalling capabilities high dorsal-most cells low lateral cells
