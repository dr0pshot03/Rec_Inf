modulation hepatitis c virus rna abundance liver-specific microrna 
micrornas small rna molecules regulate messenger rna mrna expression microrna mir- specifically expressed highly abundant human liver show sequestration mir liver cells results marked loss autonomously replicating hepatitis c viral rnas genetic interaction mir noncoding region viral genome revealed mutational analyses predicted microrna binding site ectopic expression mir molecules containing compensatory mutations studies replication-defective rnas suggested mir detectably affect mrna translation rna stability therefore mir likely facilitate replication viral rna suggesting mir may present target antiviral intervention
