control sleep cyclin regulator 
brain reversibly switches waking sleep state remain among intriguing questions biology show cyclin cyca regulator cyclin a1 essential cell cycle factors function postmitotic neurons promote sleep drosophila melanogaster reducing abundance cyca neurons delayed wake-sleep transition caused multiple arousals sleep reduced homeostatic response sleep deprivation cyca expressed similar neurons adult brain intermingled circadian clock neurons suggesting functional interactions among neurons controlling sleep circadian behavior
