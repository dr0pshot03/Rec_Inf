requirement hos2 histone deacetylase gene activity yeast
histone deacetylases typified class rpd3 yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae historically associated gene repression now demonstrate hos2 another member class family binds coding regions genes primarily gene activation specifically deacetylates lysines h3 h4 histone tails moreover hos2 preferentially associated genes high activity genome-wide also show hos2 associated factor set3 necessary efficient transcription therefore data indicate contrast class histone deacetylases hos2 directly required gene activation
