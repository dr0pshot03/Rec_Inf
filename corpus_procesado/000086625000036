modules neurons sharing common property basic organizational feature mammalian sensory cortex primary visual cortex v1 characterized orientation modules-groups cells share preferred stimulus orientation-which organized highly ordered orientation map show ferrets retinal projections routed auditory pathway visually responsive neurons rewired primary auditory cortex also organized orientation modules orientation tuning neurons within modules comparable tuning cells v1 orientation map less orderly horizontal connections rewired cortex patchy periodic connections normal auditory cortex less connections v1 data show afferent activity profound influence diverse components cortical circuitry including thalamocortical local intracortical connections involved generation orientation tuning long-range horizontal connections important creating orientation map
