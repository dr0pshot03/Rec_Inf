feronia receptor-like kinase mediates male-female interactions pollen tube reception
flowering plants signaling male pollen tube synergid cells female gametophyte required fertilization arabidopsis thaliana mutant feronia fer fertilization impaired pollen tube fails arrest thus continues grow inside female gametophyte fer encodes synergid-expressed plasma membrane-localized receptor-like kinase found fer protein accumulates asymmetrically synergid membrane filiform apparatus interspecific crosses using pollen arabidopsis lyrata cardamine flexuosa thaliana stigmas resulted fer-like phenotype correlates sequence divergence extracellular domain fer findings show female control pollen tube reception based fer-dependent signaling pathway may play role reproductive isolation barriers
