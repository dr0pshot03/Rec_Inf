structural basis iron piracy pathogenic neisseria
neisseria obligate human pathogens causing bacterial meningitis septicaemia gonorrhoea neisseria require iron survival can extract directly human transferrin transport across outer membrane transport system consists tbpa integral outer membrane protein tbpb co-receptor attached cell surface proteins potentially important vaccine therapeutic targets two key questions driving neisseria research human transferrin specifically targeted bacteria liberate iron transferrin neutral ph address questions solved crystal structures tbpa-transferrin complex corresponding co-receptor tbpb characterized tbpb-transferrin complex small-angle x-ray scattering tbpa-tbpb-transferrin complex electron microscopy studies provide rational basis specificity tbpa human transferrin show tbpa promotes iron release transferrin elucidate tbpb facilitates process
