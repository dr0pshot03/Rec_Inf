direct measurement long-range third-order coherence bose-einstein condensates
major advance understanding behavior light describe coherence light source using correlation functions define spatio-temporal relationship pairs larger groups photons correlations also fundamental property matter performed simultaneous measurement second third-order correlation functions atoms atom bunching arrival time pairs triplets thermal atoms just bose-einstein condensation bec temperature observed lower temperatures demonstrated conclusively long-range coherence bec correlation functions third order supports prediction like coherent light bec possesses long-range coherence orders
