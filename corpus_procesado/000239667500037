imaging mott insulator shells using atomic clock shifts 
microwave spectroscopy used probe superfluid-mott insulator transition bose-einstein condensate three-dimensional optical lattice using density-dependent transition frequency shifts able spectroscopically distinguish sites different occupation numbers directly image sites occupation numbers one five revealing shell structure mott insulator phase used spectroscopy determine onsite interaction lifetime individual shells
