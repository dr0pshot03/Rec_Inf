time variability heterogeneity coma 67p/churyumov-gerasimenko 
comets contain best-preserved material beginning planetary system nuclei comae composition reveal clues physical chemical conditions early solar system comets formed rosina rosetta orbiter spectrometer ion neutral analysis onboard rosetta spacecraft measured coma composition comet 67p/churyumov-gerasimenko well-sampled time resolution per rotation measurements made many comet rotation periods wide range latitudes thesemeasurements show large fluctuations composition heterogeneous coma diurnal possibly seasonal variations major outgassing species: water carbon monoxide carbon dioxide results indicate complex coma-nucleus relationship seasonal variations may driven temperature differences just comet surface
