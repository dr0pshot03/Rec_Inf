sn-zeolite beta heterogeneous chemoselective catalyst baeyer-villiger oxidations 
baeyer-villiger oxidation first reported years ago1 evolved versatile reaction widely used2 convert ketones-readily available building blocks organic chemistry-into complex valuable esters lactones catalytic versions baeyer-villiger oxidation particularly attractive practical applications catalytic transformations simplify processing conditions minimizing reactant use well waste production benefits expected replacing peracids traditionally used oxidant cheaper less polluting hydrogen peroxide3 dissolved platinum complexes4 solid acids zeolites56 sulphonated resins7 efficiently activate ketone oxidation hydrogen peroxide catalysts lack sufficient selectivity desired product starting material contains functional groups ketone group; perform especially poorly presence carbon-carbon double bonds show upon incorporation weight per cent tin framework zeolite beta acts efficient stable heterogeneous catalyst baeyer-villiger oxidation saturated well unsaturated ketones hydrogen peroxide desired lactones forming % reaction products ascribe high selectivity direct activation ketone group whereas catalysts first activate hydrogen peroxide can interact ketone group well functional groups
