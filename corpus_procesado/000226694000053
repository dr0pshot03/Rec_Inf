illumination melanopsin signaling pathway
mammals small population intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells iprgcs plays key role regulation nonvisual photic responses behavioral responses tight pineal melatonin synthesis pupillary light reflex steep latency iprgcs also express melanopsin opn4 putative opsin-family photopigment shown play rote mediating nonvisual photic responses melanopsin required function inner retinal pathway precise role generating photic responses yet determined found expression melanopsin xenopus oocytes results light-dependent activation membrane currents galphaq/galpha g protein pathway action spectrum closely matching melanopsin-expressing iprgcs behavioral responses light mice lacking rods cones coexpressed arrestins melanopsin use all-trans-retinaldehyde chromophore suggests may function bireactive opsin also found melanopsin activate cation channel trpc3 mammalian homolog drosophila phototransduction channels trp trpl melanopsin therefore signals like invertebrate opsin like classical vertebrate rod-and-cone opsin
