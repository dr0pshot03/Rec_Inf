phytohormone abscisic acid aba regulates various physiological processes plants molecular mechanisms achieved fully understood genetic approaches characterized several downstream components aba signalling receptor aba remained elusive although studies indicate several aba response genes encode rna-binding rna-processing proteins none found functional binding aba show fca rna-binding protein involved flowering binds aba high affinity interaction stereospecific follows receptor kinetics interaction fca aba molecular effects downstream events autonomous floral pathway consequently ability plant undergo transition flowering show aba binding exerts direct control fca-mediated processing precursor messenger rna results indicate fca aba receptor involved rna metabolism controlling flowering time
