developmental reprogramming chromosome transfer mitotic mouse zygotes 
now animal cloning production embryonic stem cell lines somatic cell nuclear transfer relied introducing nuclei meiotic oocytes contrast attempts somatic cell nuclear transfer fertilized interphase zygotes failed result generally assumed unfertilized human oocytes will required generation tailored human embryonic stem cell lines patients somatic cell nuclear transfer report however unlike interphase zygotes mouse zygotes temporarily arrested mitosis can support somatic cell reprogramming production embryonic stem cell lines full-term development cloned animals thus human zygotes perhaps human embryonic blastomeres may useful supplements human oocytes creation patient-derived human embryonic stem cells
