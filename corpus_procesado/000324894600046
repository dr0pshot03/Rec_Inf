abnormal grain growth induced cyclic heat treatment
polycrystalline materials grain growth occurs elevated temperatures reduce total area grain boundaries high energy grain growth rate usually slows annealing time making hard obtain grains larger millimeter size report crystal growth method employs cyclic heat treatment obtain single crystal several centimeters copper-based shape-memory alloy abnormal grain growth phenomenon results formation subgrain structure introduced phase transformation findings provide method fabricating single-crystal large-grain structure important shape-memory properties magnetic properties creep properties among others
