extensive variation chromatin states across humans 
majority disease-associated variants lie outside protein-coding regions suggesting link variation regulatory regions disease predisposition studied differences chromatin states using five histone modifications cohesin ctcf lymphoblastoid lines individuals diverse ancestry found extensive signal variation regulatory regions often switch active repressed states across individuals enhancer activity particularly diverse among individuals whereas gene expression remains relatively stable chromatin variability shows genetic inheritance trios correlates genetic variation population divergence associated disruptions transcription factor binding motifs overall results provide insights chromatin variation among humans
