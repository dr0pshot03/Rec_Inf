direct conversion fibroblasts functional neurons defined factors 
cellular differentiation lineage commitment considered robust irreversible processes development recent work shown mouse human fibroblasts can reprogrammed pluripotent state combination four transcription factors raised question whether transcription factors directly induce defined somatic cell fates undifferentiated state hypothesized combinatorial expression neural-lineage-specific transcription factors directly convert fibroblasts neurons starting pool nineteen candidate genes identified combination three factors ascl1 brn2 also called pou3f2 myt1l suffice rapidly efficiently convert mouse embryonic postnatal fibroblasts functional neurons vitro induced neuronal cells express multiple neuron-specific proteins generate action potentials form functional synapses generation cells non-neural lineages important implications studies neural development neurological disease modelling regenerative medicine
