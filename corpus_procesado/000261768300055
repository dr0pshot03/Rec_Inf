endonucleolytic rna cleavage eukaryotic exosome 
exosome major eukaryotic nuclease located nucleus cytoplasm contributes processing quality control and/ turnover large number cellular rnas- large macromolecular assembly described -> exonuclease shown contain nine subunit ring structure evolutionarily related archaeal exosome like complexes bacterial polynucleotide phosphorylases recent results shown unlike prokaryotic counterparts yeast human ring structures catalytically inactive contrast exonucleolytic activity yeast exosome core shown mediated rnb domain eukaryote specific dis3 subunit- show using vitro assays yeast dis3 additional endoribonuclease activity mediated pin domain located amino terminus multidomain protein simultaneous inactivation endonucleolytic exonucleolytic activities exosome core generates synthetic growth phenotype vivo supporting physiological function pin domain activity responsible cleavage natural exosome substrates independently exonucleolytic degradation contrast current models results show eukaryotic exosome cores endonucleolytic exonucleolytic activities mediated two distinct domains dis3 subunit mode action eukaryotic exosome cores rna processing degradation reconsidered taking account cooperation multiple ribonucleolytic activities
