reducing dimensionality data neural networks 
high-dimensional data can converted low-dimensional codes training multilayer neural network small central layer reconstruct high-dimensional input vectors gradient descent can used fine-tuning weights autoencoder networks works well initial weights close good solution describe effective way initializing weights allows deep autoencoder networks learn low-dimensional codes work much better principal components analysis tool reduce dimensionality data
