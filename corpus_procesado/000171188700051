photochemical cycling iron surface ocean mediated microbial ironiii-binding ligands 
iron limiting nutrient primary production large areas oceans1- dissolved ironiii upper oceans occurs almost entirely form complexes strong organic ligands5- presumed biological origin89 although importance organic ligands aquatic iron cycling becoming clear mechanism involved process remains uncertain report observations photochemical reactions involving feiii bound siderophores-high-affinity ironiii ligands produced bacteria facilitate iron acquisition10- show photolysis feiii-siderophore complexes leads formation lower-affinity feiii ligands reduction feiii increasing availability siderophore-bound iron uptake planktonic assemblages photochemical reactions mediated alpha hydroxy acid moiety group generally found present marine siderophores characterized13- suggest feiii-binding ligands can enhance photolytic production reactive iron species euphotic zone influence iron availability aquatic systems
