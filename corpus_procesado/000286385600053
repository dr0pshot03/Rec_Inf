development asymmetric inhibition underlying direction selectivity retina 
establishing precise synaptic connections crucial development functional neural circuits direction-selective circuit retina relies upon highly selective wiring inhibitory inputs starburst amacrine cells sacs onto four subtypes on-off direction-selective ganglion cells dsgcs preferring motion one four cardinal directions reported rabbit sacs null sides dsgcs form functional gaba c-aminobutyric acid-mediated synapses whereas preferred sides however known asymmetric wiring sacs dsgcs established development report transgenic mice cell-type-specific labelling synaptic connections sacs dsgcs equal strength first postnatal week regardless whether sac located preferred null side dsgc however end second postnatal week strength synapses made sacs null side dsgc significantly increased whereas made sacs located preferred side remained constant blocking retinal activity intraocular injections muscimol gabazine period alter development direction selectivity hence asymmetric inhibition sacs dsgcs achieved developmental program specifically strengthens gaba-mediated inputs sacs located null side manner dependent neural activity
