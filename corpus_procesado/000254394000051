aversive learning enhances perceptual cortical discrimination indiscriminable odor cues
learning associate sensory cues threats critical minimizing aversive experience ecological benefit associative learning relies accurate perception predictive cues aversive learning enhances perceptual acuity sensory signals particularly humans unclear combined multivariate functional magnetic resonance imaging olfactory psychophysics show initially indistinguishable odor enantiomers mirror image molecules become discriminable aversive conditioning paralleling spatial divergence ensemble activity patterns primary olfactory piriform cortex findings indicate aversive learning induces piriform plasticity corresponding gains odor enantiomer discrimination underscoring capacity fear conditioning update perceptual representation predictive cues well recognized role acquisition conditioned responses completely indiscriminable sensations can transformed discriminable percepts accentuates potency associative learning enhance sensory cue perception support adaptive behavior
