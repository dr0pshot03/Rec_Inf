real-time spectroscopy transition states bacteriorhodopsin retinal isomerization
real-time investigations rearrangement bonds chemical transformations require femtosecond temporal resolution atomic vibrations within reacting molecules can observed following development lasers capable emitting ultrashort laser flashes timescale chemical reactions involving relatively simple molecules monitored detail revealing transient existence intermediate species reactants transformed products- report direct observation nuclear motion complex biological system retinal chromophore bacteriorhodopsin br undergoes trans-cis photoisomerization fundamental vision process using visible-light pulses less femtosecond duration able monitor changes vibrational spectra transition state thus show despite photoexcitation anti-bonding molecular orbital involved isomerization occur instantly involves transient formation so-called tumbling state observations thus agree growing experimental- ab initio evidence three-state photoisomerization model- firmly discount initially suggested two-state model- process
