comparing photosynthetic photovoltaic efficiencies recognizing potential improvement
comparing photosynthetic photovoltaic efficiencies simple issue although processes harvest energy sunlight operate distinctly different ways produce different types products: biomass chemical fuels case natural photosynthesis nonstored electrical current case photovoltaics order find common ground evaluating energy-conversion efficiency compare natural photosynthesis present technologies photovoltaic-driven electrolysis water produce hydrogen photovoltaic-driven electrolysis efficient process measured annual basis yet short-term yields photosynthetic conversion optimal conditions come within factor photovoltaic benchmark consider opportunities frontiers synthetic biology might used enhance natural photosynthesis improved solar energy conversion efficiency
