oxygen doping modifies near-infrared band gaps fluorescent single-walled carbon nanotubes
controlled chemical modifications single-walled carbon nanotubes swcnts tune useful properties sought multiple applications found beneficial optical changes swcnts resulted introducing low concentrations oxygen atoms stable covalently oxygen-doped nanotubes prepared exposure ozone light treated samples showed distinct structure-specific near-infrared fluorescence wavelengths % longer displayed pristine semiconducting swcnts dopant sites harvest light energy absorbed undoped nanotube regions trapping mobile excitons oxygen-doped swcnts much easier detect image pristine swcnts give stronger near-infrared emission absorb shifted emission wavelength
