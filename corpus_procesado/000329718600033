conserved class queen pheromones stops social insect workers reproducing
major evolutionary transition eusociality reproductive division labor queens workers arisen independently least times ants bees wasps pheromones produced queens thought play key role regulating complex social system evolutionary history remains unknown identify first sterility-inducing queen pheromones wasp bumblebee desert ant synthesize existing data compounds characterize female fecundity species social insects results show queen pheromones strikingly conserved across least three independent origins eusociality wasps ants bees appearing use nonvolatile saturated hydrocarbons advertise fecundity and/or suppress worker reproduction results suggest queen pheromones evolved conserved signals solitary ancestors
