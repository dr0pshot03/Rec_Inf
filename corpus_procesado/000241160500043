origin dielectric dead layer nanoscale capacitors 
capacitors mainstay electronic integrated circuits devices perform essential functions storing electrical charge blocking direct current allowing alternating currents propagate often largest components circuits extensive efforts directed reducing size use high-permittivity insulators perovskite-structure srtio3 refs provide capacitance per unit area device unfortunately experiments thin-film srtio3 capacitors yielded capacitance values orders magnitude smaller expected microscopic origin reduced capacitance often discussed terms low-permittivity interfacial dead layer well understood whether dead layer exists whether intrinsic property ideal metal-insulator interface result processing issues defects strains controversial questions present fully ab initio calculations dielectric properties realistic srruo3/srtio3/srruo3 nanocapacitors show observed dramatic capacitance reduction indeed intrinsic effect demonstrate existence dielectric dead layer calculating dielectric profile across interface analyse origin extracting ionic electronic contributions electrostatic screening establish correspondence dead layer hardening collective srtio3 zone-centre polar modes determine influence electrode repeating calculations pt/srtio3/pt capacitors results provide practical guidelines minimizing deleterious effects dielectric dead layer nanoscale devices
