dna sequencing cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukaemia genome
acute myeloid leukaemia highly malignant haematopoietic tumour affects adults united states year treatment disease changed little past two decades genetic events initiate disease remain undiscovered whole genome sequencing now possible reasonable cost timeframe use approach unbiased discovery tumour specific somatic mutations alter protein coding genes present results obtained sequencing typical acute myeloid leukaemia genome matched normal counterpart obtained patients skin discovered ten genes acquired mutations two previously described mutations thought contribute tumour progression eight new mutations present virtually tumour cells presentation relapse function yet known study establishes whole genome sequencing unbiased method discovering cancer initiating mutations previously unidentified genes may respond targeted therapies
