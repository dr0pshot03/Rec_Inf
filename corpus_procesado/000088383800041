oscillatory cluster patterns homogeneous chemical system global feedback
oscillatory clusters sets domains nearly elements given domain oscillate amplitude phase- play important role understanding coupled neuron systems- simplest case system consists two clusters oscillate antiphase can occupy multiple fixed spatial domains examples cluster behaviour extended chemical systems rare shown resemble standing waves- except lack characteristic wavelength report observation so-called localized clusters-periodic antiphase oscillations one part medium remainder appears uniform-in belousov-zhabotinsky reaction-diffusion system photochemical global feedback also observe standing clusters fixed spatial domains oscillate periodically time occupy entire medium irregular clusters periodicity either space time standing clusters transforming irregular clusters localized clusters strength global negative feedback gradually increased incorporating effects global feedback model reaction able simulate successfully experimental data
