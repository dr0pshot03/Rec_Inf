hemodynamic signals correlate tightly synchronized gamma oscillations 
functional imaging methods monitor neural activity measuring hemodynamic signals closely related local field potentials lfps action potentials simultaneously recorded electrical hemodynamic responses cat visual cortex increasing stimulus strength enhanced spiking activity high-frequency lfp oscillations hemodynamic responses constant stimulus intensity hemodynamic response fluctuated fluctuations loosely related action potential frequency tightly correlated power lfp oscillations gamma range oscillations increase synchrony synaptic events suggests close correlation hemodynamic responses neuronal synchronization
