video-speed electronic paper based electrowetting
recent years number different technologies proposed use reflective displays- one appealing applications reflective display electronic paper combines desirable viewing characteristics conventional printed paper ability manipulate displayed information electronically electronic paper based electrophoretic motion particles inside small capsules demonstrated commercialized response speed system rather slow limited velocity particles recently demonstrated electrowetting attractive technology rapid manipulation liquids micrometre scale show electrowetting can also used form basis reflective display significantly faster electrophoretic displays video content can displayed display principle utilizes voltage-controlled movement coloured oil film adjacent white substrate reflectivity contrast system approach paper addition demonstrate colour concept intrinsically four times brighter reflective liquid-crystal displays twice bright emerging technologies- principle microfluidic motion low voltages applicable wide range electro-optic devices
