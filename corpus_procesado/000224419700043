genome sequence polydnavirus: insights symbiotic virus evolution 
little known fate viruses involved long-term obligatory associations eukaryotes example many species parasitoid wasps symbiotic viruses manipulate host defenses allow development parasitoid larvae complete nucleotide sequence dna enclosed virus particles injected parasitoid wasp revealed complex organization resembling eukaryote genomic region viral genome although endocellular symbiont genomes undergone dramatic loss genes evolution symbiotic viruses appears characterized extensive duplication virulence genes coding truncated versions cellular proteins
