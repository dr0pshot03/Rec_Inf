p53 controls radiation-induced gastrointestinal syndrome mice independent apoptosis
acute exposure ionizing radiation can cause lethal damage gastrointestinal gi tract condition called gi syndrome whether target cells affected radiation cause gi syndrome derived epithelium endothelium whether target cells die apoptosis mechanisms controversial issues studying mouse models found selective deletion proapoptotic genes bak1 bax gi epithelium endothelial cells protect mice developing gi syndrome sub-total-body gamma irradiation contrast selective deletion p53 gi epithelium endothelial cells sensitized irradiated mice gi syndrome transgenic mice overexpressing p53 tissues protected gi syndrome irradiation results suggest gi syndrome caused death gi epithelial cells epithelial cells die mechanism regulated p53 independent apoptosis
