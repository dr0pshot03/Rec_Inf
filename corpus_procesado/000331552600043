robustness evolvability transcription factor binding sites
robustness maintenance character presence genetic change can help preserve adaptive traits also may hinder evolvability ability bring forth novel adaptations used genotype networks analyze binding site repertoires transcription factors mice yeast providing empirical evidence robustness evolvability need conflicting properties network vertices represent binding sites two sites connected differ single nucleotide show binding sites larger genotype networks robust sequences adjacent networks can also bind transcription factors thus demonstrating robustness can facilitate evolvability
