plant uvr8 photoreceptor senses uv-b tryptophan-mediated disruption cross-dimer salt bridges
recently identified plant photoreceptor uvr8 uv resistance locus triggers regulatory changes gene expression response ultraviolet-b uv-b light unknown mechanism crystallographic solution structures uvr8 homodimer together mutagenesis far-uv circular dichroism spectroscopy reveal mechanisms uv-b perception signal transduction beta-propeller subunits form remarkable tryptophan-dominated dimer interface stitched together complex salt-bridge network salt-bridging arginines flank excitonically coupled cross-dimer tryptophan pyramid responsible uv-b sensing photoreception reversibly disrupts salt bridges triggering dimer dissociation signal initiation mutation single tryptophan phenylalanine retunes photoreceptor detect uv-c wavelengths analyses establish uvr8 functions photoreceptor without prosthetic chromophore promote plant development survival sunlight
