imaging transient structures using nanosecond situ tem
microstructure properties material depend dynamic processes defect motion nucleation growth phase transitions transmission electron microscopy tem can spatially resolve nanoscale phenomena lacks time resolution direct observation used photoemitted electron pulse probe dynamic events snapshot diffraction imaging nanosecond resolution inside dynamic tem use capability moving reaction front reactive nanolaminates observed situ time resolved images diffraction show transient cellular morphology dynamically mixing self propagating reaction front revealing brief phase separation cooling thus provide insights mechanisms driving self propagating high temperature synthesis
