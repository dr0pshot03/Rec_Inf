self-motion perception stationary objects
one ways perceive shape seeing motion- visual motion may actively generated example locomotion passively observed study perception three-dimensional structure motion nonmoving passive observer environment moving rigid objects used substitute active observer moving environment stationary objects rigidity hypothesis played central role computational experimental studies structure motion show adequate substitution active passive observers can perceive three-dimensional structure differently despite experiencing visual stimulus: active observers perception three-dimensional structure depends extraretinal information movements visual system thus treats objects stationary allocentric earth-fixed reference frame differently objects merely rigid results show action makes important contribution depth perception argue revision rigidity hypothesis incorporate special case stationary objects
