self-motion perception stationary objects 
one ways perceive shape seeing motion1- visual motion may actively generated example locomotion passively observed study perception three-dimensional structure motion nonmoving passive observer environment moving rigid objects used substitute1 active observer moving environment stationary objects; rigidity hypothesis played central role computational experimental studies structure motion45 show adequate substitution active passive observers can perceive three-dimensional structure differently despite experiencing visual stimulus: active observers perception three-dimensional structure depends extraretinal information movements visual system thus treats objects stationary allocentric earth-fixed reference frame differently objects merely rigid results show action makes important contribution depth perception argue revision rigidity hypothesis incorporate special case stationary objects
