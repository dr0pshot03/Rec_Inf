opening closing bacterial rna polymerase clamp 
using single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer defined bacterial rna polymerase rnap clamp conformation step transcription initiation elongation find clamp predominantly open free rnap early intermediates transcription initiation closes upon formation catalytically competent transcription initiation complex remains closed initial transcription transcription elongation show four rnap inhibitors interfere clamp opening propose clamp opening allows dna loaded unwound rnap active-center cleft dna loading unwinding trigger clamp closure clamp closure accounts high stability initiation complexes high stability processivity elongation complexes
