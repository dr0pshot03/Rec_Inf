myeloperoxidase leukocyte-derived vascular oxidase 
myeloperoxidase mpo abundant mammalian phagocyte hemoprotein thought primarily mediate host defense reactions although microbicidal functions well established vitro humans deficient mpo unusual risk infection mpo observed herein modulate vascular signaling vasodilatory functions nitric oxide acute inflammation leukocyte degranulation mpo localized around vascular endothelial cells rodent model acute endotoxemia impaired endothelium-dependent relaxant responses mpo-deficient mice resistant altered vascular responsiveness due catalytic consumption substrate radicals generated mpo thus mpo can directly modulate vascular inflammatory responses regulating bioavailability
