two-dimensional spectroscopy electronic couplings photosynthesis 
time-resolved optical spectroscopy widely used study vibrational electronic dynamics monitoring transient changes excited state populations femtosecond timescale yet fundamental cause electronic vibrational dynamics-the coupling different energy levels involved-is usually inferred indirectly two-dimensional femtosecond infrared spectroscopy based heterodyne detection three-pulse photon echoes- recently allowed direct mapping vibrational couplings yielding transient structural information extend approach visible range directly measure electronic couplings molecular complex fenna-matthews-olson photosynthetic light-harvesting protein photosynthetic systems conversion light chemical energy driven electronic couplings ensure efficient transport energy light-capturing antenna pigments reaction centre monitor process function time frequency show excitation energy simply cascade stepwise energy ladder find instead distinct energy transport pathways depend sensitively detailed spatial properties delocalized excited-state wavefunctions whole pigment-protein complex
