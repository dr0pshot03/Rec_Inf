measuring surface dynamics glassy polymers 
motion polymer chain segments cooled glass transition temperature slows markedly; sufficient cooling segmental motion becomes completely arrested debate whether chain segments near free surface thin films affected way bulk material partially embedding removing gold nanospheres produced high surface coverage well defined nanodeformations polystyrene surface; probe surface dynamics measured time dependent relaxation surface deformations function temperature kelvin surface relaxation observed temperatures providing strong direct evidence enhanced surface mobility relative bulk deviation bulk relaxation became pronounced temperature decreased bulk glass transition temperature temperature dependence relaxation time much weaker bulk relaxation polystyrene process exhibited discernible temperature dependence kelvin
