soft-chemistry-based routes epitaxial alpha-quartz thin films tunable textures
piezoelectric nanostructured quartz films high resonance frequencies needed microelectronic devices however synthesis methods frustrated inhomogeneous crystal growth crystal twinning loss nanofeatures upon crystallization report epitaxial growth nanostructured polycrystalline quartz films silicon [si] substrates via solution deposition gelation amorphous silica thin films followed thermal treatment key process combined use either strontium sr2+ barium ba2+ catalyst amphiphilic molecular template silica nanostructure constructed cooperative self-assembly permits homogeneous distribution cations responsible crystallization quartz low mismatch silicon a-quartz cell parameters selects particular polymorph inducing epitaxial growth
