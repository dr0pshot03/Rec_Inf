laser cooling collisional redistribution radiation 
general idea optical radiation may cool matter put forward years ago doppler cooling dilute atomic gases extremely successful application concept recently anti-stokes cooling multilevel systems explored culminating optical refrigeration solids- collisional redistribution radiation proposed different cooling mechanism atomic two-level systems although experimental investigations using moderate-density gases reached cooling regime experimentally demonstrate laser cooling atomic gas based collisional redistribution radiation using rubidium atoms argon buffer gas pressure bar frequent collisions ultradense gas transiently shift highly red-detuned laser beamthat one detuned much lower frequency resonance whereas spontaneous decay occurs close unperturbed atomic resonance frequency excitation cycle kinetic energy order kbt-that thermal energy kb boltzmanns constant t temperature-is extracted dense atomic sample proof-of-principle experiment thermally non-isolated sample demonstrate relative cooling k cooled gas density ten orders magnitude greater typical values used doppler-cooling experiments cooling power reaches mw future applications technique may include supercooling beyond homogeneous nucleation temperature optical chillers
