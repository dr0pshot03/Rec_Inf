stabilization cooperative virulence expression avirulent phenotype 
pathogens often infect hosts collective actions: secrete growth-promoting compounds virulence factors evoke host reactions fuel colonization host behaviours vulnerable rise mutants benefit collective action without contributing it; behaviours can evolutionarily stable well understood1 address question using intestinal pathogen salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium hereafter termed s typhimurium manipulates host induce inflammation thereby outcompetes commensal microbiota23 notably virulence factors needed host manipulation expressed bistable fashion leading slow-growing subpopulation expresses virulence genes fast-growing subpopulation phenotypically avirulent45 show expression genetically identical phenotypically avirulent subpopulation essential evolutionary stability virulence pathogen using combination mathematical modelling experimental evolution competition experiments found within-host evolution leads emergence mutants genetically avirulent fast-growing mutants defectors exploit inflammation without contributing infection experiments initiated wild-type s typhimurium defectors increase slowly frequency genetically modified s typhimurium strain phenotypically avirulent subpopulation reduced size defectors rise rapidly inflammation ceases prematurely s typhimurium quickly cleared gut results establish host manipulation s typhimurium cooperative trait vulnerable rise avirulent defectors; expression phenotypically avirulent subpopulation grows fast defectors slows process thereby promotes evolutionary stability virulence points key role bistable virulence gene expression stabilizing cooperative virulence may lead way new approaches controlling pathogens
