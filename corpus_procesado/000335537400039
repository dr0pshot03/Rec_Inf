direct nonoxidative conversion methane ethylene aromatics hydrogen
efficient use natural gas will require catalysts can activate first c-h bond methane suppressing complete dehydrogenation avoiding overoxidation report single iron sites embedded silica matrix enable direct nonoxidative conversion methane exclusively ethylene aromatics reaction initiated catalytic generation methyl radicals followed series gas-phase reactions absence adjacent iron sites prevents catalytic c-c coupling oligomerization hence coke deposition kelvin methane conversion reached maximum % ethylene selectivity peaked % whereas total hydrocarbon selectivity exceeded % representing atom-economical transformation process methane lattice-confined single iron sites delivered stable performance deactivation observed hour test
