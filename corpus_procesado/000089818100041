niche maintaining germ line stem cells drosophila ovary 
stromal cells thought generate specific regulatory microenviroments niches control stem cell behavior characterizing stem cell niches vivo remains important goal difficult achieve individual ovarioles drosophila ovary contain two germ line stem cells maintain oocyte production show anterior ovariolar somatic cells comprising three cell types act germ line stem cell niche germ line stem cells lost normal induced differentiation efficiently replaced ability repopulate niche increases functional lifetime ovarioles vivo studies implicate one somatic cell types cap cells key niche component
