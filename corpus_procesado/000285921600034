sensing anomeric effect solvent-free environment 
anomeric effect chemical phenomenon- refers observed stabilization six-membered carbohydrate rings contain electronegative substituent c1 position ring stereoelectronic effect influences three-dimensional shapes many biological molecules can manifested classical manner involving interaction endocyclic oxygen atom o5 found sugars c1 substituent endo-anomeric effect also corresponding interaction electronegative exocyclic substituent o5 exoanomeric effect however underlying physical origins phenomenon still clear- show using combination laser spectroscopy computational analysis truncated peptide motif can engage two anomers isolated sugar gas phase environment lacking extraneous factors confound analysis anomers isomers differ orientation substituent c1 complexes formed peptide alpha beta-anomers d-galactose nearly identical structurally however strength polarization interactions peptide differs greatly natural bond order calculations support observation together reveal dominance exo endo-anomeric effect interactions oxygen atoms positions c1 c2 o1 o2 respectively pyranose ring can alter exo/endo ratio carbohydrate results suggest will important reevaluate influence biological effects substituents position c2 sugars
