pathophysiological consequences vegf-induced vascular permeability
although vascular endothelial growth factor vegf induces angiogenesis also disrupts vascular barrier function diseased tissues accordingly vegf expression cancer ischaemic disease unexpected pathophysiological consequences uncoupling endothelial cell cell junctions vegf causes vascular permeability oedema resulting extensive injury ischaemic tissues stroke myocardial infarction cancer vegf mediated disruption vascular barrier may potentiate tumour cell extravasation leading widespread metastatic disease therefore blocking vascular permeability promoting effects vegf may feasible reduce tissue injury ischaemic disease minimize invasive properties circulating tumour cells
