coordinating dna replication means priming loop differential synthesis rate 
genomic dna replicated two dna polymerase molecules one works close association helicase copy leading-strand template continuous manner second copies already unwound lagging-strand template discontinuous manner synthesis okazaki fragments considering lagging-strand polymerase recycle completion every okazaki fragment slowsteps primer synthesis hand-off polymerase- understood two strands synthesized net rate- show using t7 replication proteins rna primers made fly ongoing dna synthesis leading-strand t7 replisome pause primer synthesis contrary previous reports instead leading-strand polymerase remains limited speed helicase therefore synthesizes dna slowly lagging-strand polymerase show primase-helicase t7 gp4 maintains contact priming sequence ongoing dna synthesis nascent lagging-strand template therefore organizes priming loop keeps primer physical proximity replication complex findings provide three synergistic mechanisms coordination: first primers made concomitantly dna synthesis second priming loop ensures efficient primer use hand-off polymerase third lagging-strand polymerase copies dna faster allows keep leading-strand dna synthesis overall
