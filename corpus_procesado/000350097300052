n--methyladenosine-dependent rna structural switches regulate rna-protein interactions 
rna-binding proteins control many aspects cellular biology binding single-stranded rna binding motifs rbms1- however rbms can buried within local rna structures thus inhibiting rna-protein interactions n--methyladenosine m6a abundant dynamic internal modification eulcaryotic messenger rna8- can selectively recognized ythdf2 protein affect stability cytoplasmic mrnas15 m6a achieves wide-ranging physiological role needs exploration show human cells m6a controls rna-structuredependent accessibility rbms affect rna-protein interactions biological regulation; term mechanism m6a-switch found m6a alters local structure mrna long non-coding rna incrna facilitate binding heterogeneous nuclear ribonudeoprotein c hnrnpc abundant nuclear rnabinding protein responsible pre-mrna processing combining photoactivatable-ribonucleoside-enhanced crosslinking immunoprecipitation par-clip anti-m6a immunoprecipitation merip approaches enabled us identify m6a-switches among hnrnpc-binding sites; global m6a reduction decreased hnrnpc binding high-confidence m6a-switches determined m6a-switch-regulated hnrnpc-binding activities affect abundance well alternative splicing target mrnas demonstrating regulatory role m6a-switches gene expression rna maturation results illustrate rna-binding proteins gain regulated access rbms m6a-dependent rna structural remodelling provide new direction investigating rna-modification-coded cellular biology
