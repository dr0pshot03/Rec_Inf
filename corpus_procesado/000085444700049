glucocorticoid receptor: rapid exchange regulatory sites living cells 
steroid receptors bind site-specific response elements chromatin modulate gene expression hormone-dependent fashion use tandem array mouse mammary tumor virus reporter elements form glucocorticoid receptor labeled green fluorescent protein targeting receptor response elements live mouse cells observed photobleaching experiments provide direct evidence hormone-occupied receptor undergoes rapid exchange chromatin nucleoplasmic compartment thus interaction regulatory proteins target sites chromatin dynamic process previously believed
