distinct physiological behavioural functions parental alleles imprinted grb10
imprinted genes defined preferential expression single parental allele represent subset mammalian genome often key roles embryonic development also postnatal functions including energy homeostasis behaviour two parental alleles unequally represented within social group sex bias dispersal and/or variance reproductive success imprinted genes may evolve modulate social behaviour although far instance known predominantly expressed maternal allele embryogenesis grb10 encodes intracellular adaptor protein can interact several receptor tyrosine kinases downstream signalling molecules demonstrate within brain grb10 expressed paternal allele fetal life adulthood ablation expression engenders increased social dominance specifically among aspects social behaviour finding supported observed increase allogrooming paternal grb10-deficient animals grb10 therefore first example imprinted gene regulates social behaviour also currently alone exhibiting imprinted expression parental alleles tissue-specific manner loss peripherally expressed maternal allele leads significant fetal placental overgrowth thus grb10 far unique imprinted gene able influence distinct physiological processes fetal growth adult behaviour owing actions two parental alleles different tissues
