ground state ventral appendage drosophila 
drosophila melanogaster antennae legs genitalia analia make serially homologous set ventral appendages depend different selector genes unique identities diversity among structures implies common ground state selector genes modify generate different appendage morphologies show ventral appendage forms absence selector gene activity leglike consists two segments along proximo-distal axis: proximal segment distal tarsus results raise possibility evolution leglike appendages developed without selector gene activity
