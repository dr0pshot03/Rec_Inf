endothelial-cell fak targeting sensitizes tumours dna-damaging therapy 
chemoresistance serious limitation cancer treatment recently almost work done study limitation restricted tumour cells identify novel molecular mechanism endothelial cells regulate chemosensitivity establish specific targeting focal adhesion kinase fak also known ptk2 endothelial cells sufficient induce tumour-cell sensitization dna-damaging therapies thus inhibit tumour growth mice clinical relevance work supported observations low blood vessel fak expression associated complete remission human lymphoma study shows deletion fak endothelial cells apparent effect blood vessel function per se induces increased apoptosis decreased proliferation within perivascular tumour-cell compartments doxorubicin-and radiotherapy-treated mice mechanistically demonstrate endothelial-cell fak required dna-damage induced nf-kappa b activation vivo vitro production cytokines endothelial cells moreover loss endothelial-cell fak reduces dna-damage-induced cytokine production thus enhancing chemosensitization tumour cells dna-damaging therapies vitro vivo overall data identify endothelial-cell fak regulator tumour chemosensitivity furthermore anticipate proof-of-principle data will starting point development new possible strategies regulate chemosensitization targeting endothelial-cell fak specifically
