lgl pins apkc regulate neuroblast self-renewal versus differentiation 
cell chooses proliferate differentiate important issue stem cell cancer biology drosophila neuroblasts undergo self-renewal every cell division producing another neuroblast differentiating daughter cell mechanisms controlling self-renewal/differentiation decision poorly understood tested whether cell polarity genes known regulate embryonic neuroblast asymmetric cell division also regulate neuroblast self-renewal clonal analysis larval brains showed pins mutant neuroblasts rapidly fail self-renew whereas lethal giant larvae lgl mutant neuroblasts generate multiple neuroblasts notably lgl pins double mutant neuroblasts divide symmetrically self-renew filling brain neuroblasts expense neurons lgl pins neuroblasts show ectopic cortical localization atypical protein kinase c apkc decrease apkc expression reduces neuroblast numbers suggesting apkc promotes neuroblast self-renewal support hypothesis neuroblast-specific overexpression membrane-targeted apkc kinase-dead version induces ectopic neuroblast self-renewal conclude cortical apkc kinase activity potent inducer neuroblast self-renewal
