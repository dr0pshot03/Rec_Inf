glioma-derived mutations idh1 dominantly inhibit idh1 catalytic activity induce hif alpha
heterozygous mutations gene encoding isocitrate dehydrogenase idh1 occur certain human brain tumors mechanistic role tumor development unknown shown tumor-derived idh1 mutations impair enzymes affinity substrate dominantly inhibit wild-type idh1 activity formation catalytically inactive heterodimers forced expression mutant idh1 cultured cells reduces formation enzyme product alpha-ketoglutarate alpha-kg increases levels hypoxia-inducible factor subunit hif alpha transcription factor facilitates tumor growth oxygen low whose stability regulated alpha-kg rise hif alpha levels reversible alpha-kg derivative hif alpha levels higher human gliomas harboring idh1 mutation tumors without mutation thus idh1 appears function tumor suppressor mutationally inactivated contributes tumorigenesis part induction hif pathway
