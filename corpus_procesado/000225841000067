cofolding organizes alfalfa mosaic virus rna coat protein replication 
alfalfa mosaic virus genomic rnas infectious viral coat protein binds rna termini crystal structure alfalfa mosaic virus rna-peptide complex reveals conserved augc repeats pro-thr-x-arg-ser-x-x-tyr coat protein amino acids cofold upon interacting alternating augc residues opposite orientation base pair different adjacent duplexes localized rna backbone reversals stabilized arginine-guanine interactions place adenosines guanines reverse order duplex results suggest uniform organized conformation similar found viral rnas transfer rna-like ends may essential replication
