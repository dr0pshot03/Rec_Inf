extensive introgression malaria vector species complex revealed phylogenomics 
introgressive hybridization now recognized widespread phenomenon role evolution remains contested use newly available reference genome assemblies investigate phylogenetic relationships introgression medically important group afrotropical mosquito sibling species identified correct species branching order resolve contentious phylogeny show lineages leading principal vectors human malaria among first split pervasive autosomal introgression malaria vectors means small fraction genome mainly x chromosome crossed species boundaries results suggest traits enhancing vectorial capacity may gained interspecific gene flow including nonsister species
