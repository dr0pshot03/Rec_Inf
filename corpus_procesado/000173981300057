retrograde support neuronal survival without retrograde transport nerve growth factor
application nerve growth factor ngf covalently cross-linked beads increased phosphorylation trka akt mitogen-activated protein kinase cultured rat sympathetic neurons ngf beads iodine--labeled ngf beads supplied distal axons resulted survival % neurons hours little retrograde transport iodine--labeled ngf whereas application free iodine--labeled ngf nanograms per milliliter produced fold retrograde transport % neurons survived thus contrast widely accepted theory neuronal survival signal can reach cell bodies unaccompanied ngf initiated
