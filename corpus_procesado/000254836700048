video-rate far-field optical nanoscopy dissects synaptic vesicle movement 
present video-rate frames per second far-field optical imaging focal spot size nanometers living cells fluorescently labeled synaptic vesicles inside axons cultured neurons recorded stimulated emission depletion sted microscopy -micrometer -micrometer field view reducing cross-sectional area focal spot factor diffraction limit nanometers sted allowed us map describe vesicle mobility within highly confined space synaptic boutons although restricted within boutons vesicle movement substantially faster nonbouton areas consistent observation sizable vesicle pool continuously transits axons study demonstrates emerging ability optical microscopy investigate intracellular physiological processes nanoscale real time
