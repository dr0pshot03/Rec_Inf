nucleotide variation along drosophila melanogaster fourth chromosome 
drosophila melanogaster fourth chromosome believed nonrecombining invariable classic example effect natural selection eliminating genetic variation linked loci however chromosome-wide assay nucleotide variation natural populations observed high level polymorphism similar -kilobase region marked levels polymorphism several fragments interspersed regions little variation suggesting different evolutionary histories different chromosomal domains statistical tests neutral evolution showed haplotypes predominate -kilobase polymorphic region finally contrary expectation recombination identified six recombination events within chromosome thus positive darwinian selection recombination affected evolution chromosome
