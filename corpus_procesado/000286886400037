single mimivirus particles intercepted imaged x-ray laser
x-ray lasers offer new capabilities understanding structure biological systems complex materials matter extreme conditions- short extremely bright coherent x-ray pulses can used outrun key damage processes obtain single diffraction pattern large macromolecule virus cell sample explodes turns plasma continuous diffraction pattern non-crystalline objects permits oversampling direct phase retrieval show high-quality diffraction data can obtained single x-ray pulse noncrystalline biological sample single mimivirus particle injected pulsed beam hard-x-ray free-electron laser linac coherent light source calculations indicate energy deposited virus pulse heated particle k pulse left sample reconstructed exit wavefront image yielded nm full-period resolution single exposure showed measurable damage reconstruction indicates inhomogeneous arrangement dense material inside virion expect significantly higher resolutions will achieved experiments shorter brighter photon pulses focused smaller area resolution experiments can extended samples available multiple identical copies
