determination relative growth rates natural quartz crystals
although theory describing crystal growth geological environment well established- quantitative studies delimit absolute time involved growth natural crystals- actual mechanisms responsible variation size shape individual crystal faces fact well understood describe micro-infrared spectroscopic study single gem-quality quartz crystal allows us measure size shape relative growth rate crystal faces active throughout growth history demonstrate abundances hydrogen-bearing impurities can serve speedometers monitor growth rate advancing crystal faces technique can applied crystals variety geological environments determine growth histories within electronics industry technique might facilitate production defect-free synthetic crystals required high-quality resonators ultimately might allow determination absolute time involved geological processes crystallization magmas fluid flow metamorphism sealing open cracks earthquake rupture zones
