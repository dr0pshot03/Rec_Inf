bacterial chromosome dynamics
bacterial chromosomes highly compacted structures share many properties eukaryote counterparts despite organized chromatin contained within cell nucleus proteins conserved across branches life act chromosome organization common mechanisms maintain genome integrity ensure faithful replication principles underlie chromosome segregation bacteria eukaryotes share similarities although bacteria segregate dna replicates lack eukaryote-like mitotic apparatus segregating chromosomes may distances newly replicated bacterial chromosomes move apart cell division small compared eukaryotes bacteria specify positional information determines cell division will occur places replication machinery chromosomal loci defined locations change cell cycle progression
