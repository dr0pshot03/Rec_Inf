complex shapes self-assembled single-stranded dna tiles 
programmed self-assembly strands nucleic acid proved highly effective creating wide range structures desired shapes- particularly successful implementation dna origami long scaffold strand folded hundreds short auxiliary strands complex shape-- modular strategies principle simpler versatile used assemble dna-- rna tiles periodic algorithmic two-dimensional lattices extended ribbons tubes three-dimensional crystals polyhedra simple finite two-dimensional shapes creating finite yet complex shapes large number uniquely addressable tiles remains challenging solve problem simplest tile form single-stranded tile sst consists base strand dna composed entirely concatenated sticky ends binds four local neighbours self-assembly although ribbons tubes controlled circumferences created using sst approach extend assemble complex two-dimensional shapes tubes hundreds cases one thousand distinct tiles main design feature self-assembled rectangle serves molecular canvas constituent sst strands-folded nm-by nm tile attached four neighbouring tiles-acting pixel desired shape drawn canvas produced one-pot annealing strands correspond pixels covered target shape remaining strands excluded implement strategy master strand collection corresponds pixel canvas use appropriate strand subsets construct distinct complex two-dimensional shapes thereby establishing sst assembly simple modular robust framework constructing nanostructures prescribed shapes short synthetic dna strands
