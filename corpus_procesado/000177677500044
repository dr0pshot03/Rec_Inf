chromosomal clustering muscle-expressed genes caenorhabditis elegans 
chromosomes divided domains open chromatin genes potential expressed domains closed chromatin genes expressed1 classic examples open chromatin domains include puffs polytene chromosomes drosophila extended loops lampbrush chromosomes23 multiple genes typically expressed together single open chromatin domain position co-expressed genes along chromosomes appear clustered investigate whether co-expressed genes clustered examined chromosomal positions genes expressed muscle caenorhabditis elegans first larval stage show co-expressed genes c elegans clustered groups - along chromosomes suggesting expression chromatin domain can extend several genes observations reveal higher-order organization structure genome order genes along chromosome correlated expression specific tissues
