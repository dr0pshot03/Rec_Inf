spring-loaded mechanism dna unwinding hepatitis c virus ns3 helicase
ns3 essential helicase replication hepatitis c virus model enzyme investigating helicase function using single-molecule fluorescence analysis showed ns3 unwinds dna discrete steps three base pairs bp dwell time analysis indicated three hidden steps required bp step taken taking account available structural data propose spring-loaded mechanism several steps one nucleotide per adenosine triphosphate molecule accumulate tension protein-dna complex relieved periodically via burst bp unwinding ns3 appears shelter displaced strand unwinding upon encountering barrier unwinding > bp snaps slips backward rapidly repeats unwinding many times succession repetitive unwinding behavior short stretch duplex may help keep secondary structures resolved viral genome replication
