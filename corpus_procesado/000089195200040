quantized phonon spectrum single-wall carbon nanotubes 
electronic spectra carbon nanotubes nanoscale systems quantized small radii similar quantization phonon spectra difficult observe far smaller energy scale probed regime measuring temperature-dependent specific heat purified single-wall nanotubes data show direct evidence one-dimensional quantized phonon subbands kelvin excellent agreement model calculations individual nanotubes differ markedly specific heat two-dimensional graphene three-dimensional graphite detailed modeling yields energy millielectron volts lowest quantized phonon subband tube-tube lattice debye energy millielectron volts implying small intertube coupling bundles
