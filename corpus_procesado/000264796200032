tyrosine dephosphorylation h2ax modulates apoptosis survival decisions 
life death fate decisions allow cells avoid massive apoptotic death response genotoxic stress although regulatory mechanisms signalling pathways controlling dna repair apoptosis well characterized precise molecular strategies determine ultimate choice dna repair survival apoptotic cell death remain incompletely understood report protein tyrosine phosphatase eya involved promoting efficient dna repair rather apoptosis response genotoxic stress mammalian embryonic kidney cells executing damage-signal-dependent dephosphorylation h2ax carboxy-terminal tyrosine phosphate y142 post-translational modification determines relative recruitment either dna repair pro-apoptotic factors tail serine phosphorylated histone h2ax gamma-h2ax allows function active determinant repair/survival versus apoptotic responses dna damage revealing additional phosphorylation-dependent mechanism modulates survival/apoptotic decisions mammalian organogenesis
