nitrification plants also fix nitrogen 
nitrification key stage nitrogen cycle; enables transformation nitrogen oxidized inorganic state12 availability nitrates produced process often limits primary productivity important determinant plant community ecology biodiversity3- chemoautotrophic prokaryotes recognized main facilitators process7 although heterotrophic nitrification fungi may significant certain conditions8 however neither biochemical ecological evidence support nitrification photoautotrophic plants show certain legumes accumulate toxin -nitropropionic acid generate oxidized inorganic nitrogen shoots returned soil litter nitrogen-fixing populations new nitrate nitrite can derived assimilation nitrogen gas normally transformation elemental nitrogen atmosphere fixed oxidized form nitrate represented nitrogen cycle multiphasic process involving several different organisms show can occur single photoautotrophic organism representing previously undescribed feature biogeochemical cycle
