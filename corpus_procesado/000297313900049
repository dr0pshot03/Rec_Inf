experimental evolution reduced sex ratio adjustment local mate competition
theory predicts local mate competition lmc favors evolution female-biased sex ratios empirical support prediction indirect comes comparative studies studies showing individuals can adjust offspring sex ratio response varying lmc intensities replicate lines population spider mite tetranychus urticae selected three lmc intensities generations within selection regime final sex ratio matched theoretical predictions furthermore ability individuals adjust offspring sex ratio diminished females evolving strict lmc females evolving relaxed lmc levels results provide direct experimental evidence evolutionary process lmc modifies sex-allocation strategies suggest evolution strict constant lmc may lead loss phenotypic plasticity
