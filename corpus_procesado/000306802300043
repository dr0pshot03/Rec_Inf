gfaj arsenate-resistant phosphate-dependent organism 
bacterial isolate gfaj proposed substitute arsenic phosphorus sustain growth shown gfaj able grow low phosphate concentrations mu m even presence high concentrations arsenate mm lacks ability grow phosphorus-depleted < mu m arsenate-containing medium high-resolution mass spectrometry analyses revealed phosphorylated central metabolites phosphorylated nucleic acids predominated arsenylated compounds including c6 sugar arsenates detected extracts gfaj- gfaj incubated arsenate experiments showed formed abiotically inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry confirmed presence phosphorus nucleic acid extracts arsenic detected per mil relative phosphorus taken together conclude gfaj arsenate-resistant still phosphate-dependent bacterium
