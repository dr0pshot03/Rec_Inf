disassembly transcriptional regulatory complexes molecular chaperones
many biological processes initiated cooperative assembly large multicomponent complexes however mechanisms modulating terminating actions complexes well understood example hormone-bound intracellular receptors irs nucleate formation transcriptional regulatory complexes whose actions cease promptly upon hormone withdrawal show p23 molecular chaperone localizes vivo genomic response elements hormone-dependent manner disrupting receptor-mediated transcriptional activation vivo vitro hsp90 weakly displayed similar activities indeed p23 hsp90 also disrupted activities non ir-containing transcriptional regulatory complexes suggest molecular chaperones promote disassembly transcriptional regulatory complexes thus enabling regulatory machineries detect respond signaling changes
