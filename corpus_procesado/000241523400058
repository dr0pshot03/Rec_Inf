distinct catalytic non-catalytic roles argonaute4 rna-directed dna methylation
dna methylation important functions stable transcriptional gene silencing immobilization transposable elements genome organization arabidopsis dna methylation can induced double-stranded rna rna interference rnai pathway response known rna-directed dna methylation requires specialized set rnai components including argonaute4 ago4- show ago4 binds small rnas including small interfering rnas sirnas originating transposable repetitive elements cleaves target rna transcripts single mutations asp-asp-his catalytic motif ago4 affect sirna-binding activity abolish catalytic potential sirna accumulation non-cpg dna methylation loci require catalytic activity ago4 whereas others less dependent activity results consistent model ago4 can function target loci two distinct separable mechanisms first ago4 can recruit components signal dna methylation manner independent catalytic activity second ago4 catalytic activity can crucial generation secondary sirnas reinforce repressive effects
