chaotic capture jupiters trojan asteroids early solar system 
jupiters trojans asteroids follow essentially orbit jupiter lead trail planet angular distance similar degrees co-orbital motion hypothesized planetesimals formed near jupiter captured onto current orbits jupiter growing possibly help gas drag- and/or collisions idea however explain basic properties trojan population particular broad orbital inclination distribution ranges similar degrees ref show trojans formed distant regions subsequently captured co-orbital motion jupiter time giant planets migrated removing neighbouring planetesimals- capture possible short period time just jupiter saturn crossed mutual : resonance dynamics trojan region completely chaotic simulations process satisfactorily reproduce orbital distribution trojans total mass
