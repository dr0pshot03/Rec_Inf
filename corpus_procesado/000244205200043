preserving evolutionary potential floras biodiversity hotspots
one biggest challenges conservation biology provide conservation planners ways prioritize effort much attention focused biodiversity hotspots however conservation evolutionary process now also acknowledged priority face global change phylogenetic diversity pd biodiversity index measures length evolutionary pathways connect given set taxa pd therefore identifies sets taxa maximize accumulation feature diversity recent studies however concluded taxon richness good surrogate pd- show taxon richness decoupled pd using biome-wide phylogenetic analysis flora undisputed biodiversity hotspot cape south africa demonstrate decoupling real-world importance conservation planning finally using database medicinal economic plant use demonstrate pd protection best strategy preserving feature diversity cape able use pd identify key regions maximize future options continuing evolution life earth benefit society
