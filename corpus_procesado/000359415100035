astrocytes important regulatory elements brain function respond neurotransmitters release gliotransmitters modulate synaptic transmission however cell-and synapse-specificity functional relationship astrocytes neurons certain brain circuits remains unknown dorsal striatum mainly comprises two intermingled subtypes striatonigral striatopallidal medium spiny neurons msns synapses belonging two neural circuits direct indirect pathways basal ganglia subpopulations astrocytes selectively responded specific msn subtype activity subpopulations astrocytes released glutamate selectively activated n-methyl-d-aspartate receptors homotypic heterotypic msns likewise astrocyte subpopulations selectively regulated homotypic synapses metabotropic glutamate receptor activation therefore bidirectional astrocyte-neuron signaling selectively occurs specific subpopulations astrocytes neurons synapses
