structural basis assembly function heterodimeric plant immune receptor 
cytoplasmic plant immune receptors recognize specific pathogen effector proteins initiate effector-triggered immunity arabidopsis immune receptors rps4 rrs1 required activate defense three different pathogens show rps4 rrs1 physically associate crystal structures n-terminal toll-interleukin- receptor/resistance tir domains rps4 rrs1 individually heterodimeric complex respectively angstrom resolution reveal conserved tir/tir interaction interface show tir domain heterodimerization required form functional rrs1/rps4 effector recognition complex rps4 tir domain activates effector-independent defense inhibited rrs1 tir domain heterodimerization interface thus rps4 rrs1 function receptor complex two components play distinct roles recognition signaling
