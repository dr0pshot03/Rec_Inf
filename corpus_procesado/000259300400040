reward-predictive cues enhance excitatory synaptic strength onto midbrain dopamine neurons
using sensory information prediction future events essential survival midbrain dopamine neurons activated environmental cues predict rewards cellular mechanisms underlie phenomenon remain elusive used vivo voltammetry vitro patch clamp electrophysiology show dopamine release reward predictive cues enhanced synaptic strength onto dopamine neurons develop course cue reward learning increased synaptic strength observed stable behavioral responding thus enhanced synaptic strength onto dopamine neurons may act facilitate transformation neutral environmental stimuli salient reward predictive cues
