three crocodilian genomes reveal ancestral patterns evolution among archosaurs
provide context diversification archosaurs-the group includes crocodilians dinosaurs birds-we generated draft genomes three crocodilians: alligator mississippiensis american alligator crocodylus porosus saltwater crocodile gavialis gangeticus indian gharial observed exceptionally slow rate genome evolution within crocodilians levels including nucleotide substitutions indels transposable element content movement gene family evolution chromosomal synteny placed within context related taxa including birds turtles suggests common ancestor taxa also exhibited slow genome evolution comparatively rapid evolution derived birds data also provided opportunity analyze heterozygosity crocodilians indicates likely reduction population size three taxa pleistocene finally data combined newly published bird genomes allowed us reconstruct partial genome common ancestor archosaurs thereby providing tool investigate genetic starting material crocodilians birds dinosaurs
