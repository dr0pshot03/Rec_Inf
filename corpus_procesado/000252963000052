innate immune homeostasis homeobox gene caudal commensal-gut mutualism drosophila 
although commensalism gut microbiota exists metazoans host factors maintain homeostatic relationship remain largely unknown show intestinal homeobox gene caudal regulates commensal-gut mutualism repressing nuclear factor kappa b-dependent antimicrobial peptide genes inhibition caudal expression flies via rna interference led overexpression antimicrobial peptides turn altered commensal population within intestine particular dominance one gut microbe gluconobacter sp strain ew707 eventually led gut cell apoptosis host mortality however restoration healthy microbiota community normal host survival caudal-rnai flies achieved reintroduction caudal gene results reveal specific genetic deficiency within host can profoundly influence gut commensal microbial community host physiology
