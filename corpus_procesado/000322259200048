ftsz protofilaments use hinge-opening mechanism constrictive force generation 
essential bacterial protein ftsz guanosine triphosphatase self-assembles structure division site termed z ring cytokinesis z ring exerts constrictive force membrane using chemical energy guanosine triphosphate hydrolysis however structural basis constriction remains unresolved present crystal structure guanosine diphosphate-bound mycobacterium tuberculosis ftsz protofilament exhibits curved conformational state structure reveals longitudinal interface important function protofilament curvature highlights hydrolysis-dependent conformational switch t3 loop leads longitudinal bending subunits generate sufficient force drive cytokinesis
