water vapour jets inside plume gas leaving enceladus
plume water vapour escapes fissures crossing south polar region saturnian moon enceladus- tidal deformation thin surface crust internal ocean result tensile compressive stresses affect width fissures therefore quantity water vapour released different locations enceladus eccentric orbit crucial measurement tidal control venting report observations occultation star plume october revealed four high density gas jets superimposed background plume gas jet positions coincide dust jets reported elsewhere inside plume maximum water column density plume twice density reported earlier density ratio agree predictions-we seen less water observed ratio jets bulk vertical velocities thermal velocities +/ supports hypothesis source plume liquid water gas accelerated supersonic velocity nozzle like channels
