unidirectional molecular motor gold surface
molecules capable mimicking function wide range mechanical devices fabricated motors can induce mechanical movement attracting particular attention molecular motors convert light chemical energy directional rotary linear motion- usually prepared operated solution used nanomachines can useful work seems essential construct systems can function surface like recently reported linear artificial muscle surface-mounted rotors realized limited directionality motion predicted demonstrate light-driven molecular motor capable repetitive unidirectional rotation can mounted surface gold nanoparticles motor design uses chiral helical alkene upper half serves propeller connected carbon carbon double bond rotation axis lower half serves stator stator carries two thiol-functionalized legs bind entire motor molecule gold surface nmr spectroscopy reveals two photo-induced cis-trans isomerizations central double bond followed thermal helix inversion prevent reverse rotation induce full unidirectional rotation propeller respect surface-mounted lower half system
