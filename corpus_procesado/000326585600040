structural change molten basalt deep mantle conditions 
silicate liquids play key part stages deep earth evolution ranging core crust formation billions years ago present-day volcanic activity quantitative models processes require knowledge structural changes compression mechanisms take place liquid silicates high pressures temperatures earths interior however obtaining knowledge long impeded challenging nature experiments recent years structural density information silica glass obtained record pressures gpa ref major step towards obtaining data molten state report structure molten basalt gpa means situ x-ray diffraction coordination silicon increases four ambient conditions six gpa similar reported silica glass- compressibility melt completion coordination change lower lower pressure implying high-order equation state can accurately describe density evolution silicate melts pressure range whole mantle transition pressure coincides marked change pressure-evolution nickel partitioning molten iron molten silicates indicating melt compressibility controls siderophile-element partitioning
