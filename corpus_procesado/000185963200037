always good turing: asymptotically optimal probability estimation 
deciphering enigma code good turing derived unintuitive yet effective formula estimating probability distribution sample data de ne attenuation probability estimator largest possible ratio per-symbol probability assigned arbitrarily long sequence distribution corresponding probability assigned estimator show common estimators infinite attenuation attenuation good-turing estimator low yet greater derive estimator whose attenuation ; asymptotically underestimate probability sequence
