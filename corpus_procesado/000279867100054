structure gating ring human large-conductance ca2+-gated k+ channel
large-conductance ca2+-gated k+ bk channels essential many biological processes smooth muscle contraction neurotransmitter release- group channels can activated synergistically voltage intracellular ca2+ large carboxy-terminal intracellular portion responsible ca2+ sensing- present crystal structure entire cytoplasmic region human bk channel ca2+-free state structure reveals four intracellular subunits comprising two tandem rck domains assembled gating ring similar seen mthk channel probably representing physiological assembly three ca2+ binding sites including ca2+ bowl mapped onto structure based mutagenesis data ca2+ bowl located within second rck domain forms ef-hand-like motif strategically positioned close assembly interface two subunits two ca2+ mg2+ binding sites asp glu /glu located first rck domain asp site high ca2+ sensitivity positioned groove amino-and carboxyterminal subdomains rck1 whereas low-affinity mg2+-binding glu /glu site positioned upper plateau gating ring close membrane structure also contains linker connecting transmembrane intracellular domains allowing us dock voltage-gated k+ channel pore known structure onto gating ring reasonable accuracy generate structural model full bk channel
