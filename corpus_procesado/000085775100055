single-molecule studies effect template tension t7 dna polymerase activity
t7 dna polymerase catalyses dna replication vitro rates bases per second --> exonuclease nucleotide removing activity separate active site enzyme possesses right hand shape common polymerases fingers palm thumb domains rate-limiting step replication thought involve conformational change open fingers state active site samples nucleotides closed state nucleotide incorporation occurs dna polymerase must function molecular motor converting chemical energy mechanical force moves template show using single-molecule assay based differential elasticity single-stranded double-stranded dna mechanical force generated rate-limiting step motor can work maximum template tension similar pn estimates mechanical entropic work done enzyme show t7 dna polymerase organizes two template bases polymerization site catalytic cycle also find force-induced fold increase exonucleolysis 40pn
