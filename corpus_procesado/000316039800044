low-temperature aqueous-phase methanol dehydrogenation hydrogen carbon dioxide 
hydrogen produced renewable resources promising potential source clean energy help low-temperature proton-exchange membrane fuel cells molecular hydrogen can converted efficiently produce electricity- implementation sustainable hydrogen production subsequent hydrogen conversion energy called hydrogen economy unfortunately physical properties make transport handling hydrogen gas difficult overcome methanol can used material storage hydrogen liquid room temperature contains per cent hydrogen however state-of-the-art method production hydrogen methanol methanol reforming conducted high temperatures degrees celsius high pressures bar limits potential applications- describe efficient low-temperature aqueous-phase methanol dehydrogenation process facilitated ruthenium complexes hydrogen generation method proceeds degrees celsius ambient pressure excellent catalyst turnover frequencies per hour turnover numbers exceeding make delivery hydrogen mobile devices-and hence use methanol practical hydrogen carrier-feasible
