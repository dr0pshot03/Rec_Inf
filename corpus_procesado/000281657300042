sequence structure-specific rna processing crispr endonuclease 
many bacteria archaea contain clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats crisprs confer resistance invasive genetic elements central immune system production crispr-derived rnas crrnas transcription crispr locus identify endoribonuclease csy4 responsible crispr transcript pre-crrna processing pseudomonas aeruginosa angstrom crystal structure csy4 bound cognate rna reveals csy4 makes sequence-specific interactions major groove crrna repeat stem-loop together electrostatic contacts phosphate backbone enable csy4 bind selectively cleave pre-crrnas using phylogenetically conserved serine histidine residues active site rna recognition mechanism identified explains sequence-and structure-specific processing large family crispr-specific endoribonucleases
