cortical activity reductions repetition priming can result rapid response learning
recent observation objects speeds subsequent identification classification common form learning known repetition priming can operate absence explicit memory earlier experiences functional neuroimaging shown object classification improved way accompanied neural priming reduced neural activity prefrontal fusiform cortical regions- observations led suggestions cortical representations items undergo tuning whereby neurons encoding irrelevant information respond less given object observed repeatedly thereby facilitating future availability pertinent object knowledge provide experimental support alternative hypothesis reduced cortical activity occurs subjects rapidly learn previous responses primed object classification bigger shoebox cue reversal smaller shoebox greatly slowed performance completely eliminated neural priming fusiform cortex suggests cortical item representations available primed objects new objects contrast prefrontal cortex activity tracked behavioural priming predicted degree cue reversal slow object classification highlighting role prefrontal cortex executive control
