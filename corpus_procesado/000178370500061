mantle slabs drive plate tectonics 
gravitational pull subducted slabs thought drive motions earths tectonic plates coupling slabs plates well established slab mechanically attached subducting plate can exert direct pull plate alternatively detached slab may drive plate exciting flow mantle exerts shear traction base plate geologic history subduction estimated relative importance "pull" versus "suction" present-day plates observed plate motions best predicted slabs upper mantle attached plates generate slab pull forces account half total driving force plates slabs lower mantle supported viscous mantle forces drive plates slab suction
