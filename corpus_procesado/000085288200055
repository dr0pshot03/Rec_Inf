maintenance functional equivalence paralogous hox gene evolution 
biological diversity driven mainly gene duplication followed mutation selection divergence either regulatory protein-coding sequences can result quite different biological functions even closely related genes concept exemplified mammalian hox gene complex group genes located linkage groups dispersed chromosomes- evolution complex beean amplification cis primordial hox gene produce members followed duplications tuans much entire unit consequence hox genes occupy relative position along chromosomal coordinate trans-paralogous genes share similarity sequence expression pattern adjacent hox genes chromosome studies mice indicate although individual family members may unique biological roles also share overlapping functions paralogues- show proteins encoded paralogous genes hoxa3 hoxd3 can carry identical biological functions different roles attributed genes result quantitative modulations gene expression
