crystallization age eucrite zircon
eucrites group meteorites represent first planetary igneous activity following metal-silicate differentiation early planetesimal similar asteroid vesta thus help date geophysical processes occurring bodies early solar system using short-lived radionuclide hf relative chronometer demonstrate eucrite zircon crystallized quickly within million years metal-silicate differentiation implies mantle differentiation eucrite parent body occurred period internal heat decay al fe still available later metamorphism eucrites took place least million years zircons crystallized likely caused heating impacts burial hot material excavated impacts rather lava flows thus timing eucrite formation mantle differentiation constrained
