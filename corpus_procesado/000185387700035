neutron-mapping polymer flow: scattering flow visualization molecular theory 
flows complex fluids need understood macroscopic molecular scales macroscopic response controls fluid behavior molecular scale ultimately gives rise rheological solid-state properties flow field entangled polymer melt extended contraction typical many polymer processes imaged optically small-angle neutron scattering dual-probe technique samples macroscopic stress field flow microscopic configuration polymer molecules selected points results compared recent "tube model" molecular theory entangled melt flow able calculate stress single-chain structure factor first principles combined action three fundamental entangled processes reptation contour length fluctuation convective constraint release essential account quantitatively rich rheological behavior multiscale approach unearths new feature: orientation length scale entire chain decays considerably slowly smaller entanglement length
