intravascular danger signals guide neutrophils sites sterile inflammation
neutrophils recruited blood sites sterile inflammation contribute wound healing may also cause tissue damage using spinning disk confocal intravital microscopy examined kinetics molecular mechanisms neutrophil recruitment sites focal hepatic necrosis vivo adenosine triphosphate released necrotic cells activated nlrp3 inflammasome generate inflammatory microenvironment alerted circulating neutrophils adhere within liver sinusoids subsequently generation intravascular chemokine gradient directed neutrophil migration healthy tissue toward foci damage lastly formyl-peptide signals released necrotic cells guided neutrophils nonperfused sinusoids injury thus dynamic vivo imaging revealed multistep hierarchy directional cues guide neutrophil localization sites sterile inflammation
