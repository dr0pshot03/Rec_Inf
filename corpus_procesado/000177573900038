structural studies several distinct metastable forms amorphous ice 
structural changes annealing high-density amorphous ice studied neutron x-ray diffraction first diffraction peak followed high low-density amorphous form changes observed occur series intermediate forms appear metastable anneal temperature five distinct amorphous forms studied neutron scattering many forms may possible radial distribution functions indicate structure evolves systematically angstroms phase transformations low-temperature liquid water may much complex currently understood
