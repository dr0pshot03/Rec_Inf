quantum simulation dirac equation 
dirac equation successfully merges quantum mechanics special relativity provides natural description electron spin predicts existence antimatter able reproduce accurately spectrum hydrogen atom realm dirac equation-relativistic quantum mechanics-is considered natural transition quantum field theory however dirac equation also predicts peculiar effects kleins paradox zitterbewegung unexpected quivering motion free relativistic quantum particle predicted phenomena key fundamental examples understanding relativistic quantum effects difficult observe real particles recent years increased interest simulations relativistic quantum effects using different physical set-ups- parameter tunability allows access different physical regimes perform proof-of-principle quantum simulation one-dimensional dirac equation using single trapped ion set behave free relativistic quantum particle measure particle position function time study zitterbewegung different initial superpositions positive negative-energy spinor states well crossover relativistic non-relativistic dynamics high level control trapped-ion experimental parameters makes possible simulate textbook examples relativistic quantum physics
