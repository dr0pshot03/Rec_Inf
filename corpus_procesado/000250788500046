sex-linked genetic influence caste determination termite
ecologically successful destructive termite species nymph caste irreversibly wingless worker caste early developmental bifurcation separating castes widely accepted strictly environmentally determined present evidence genotype also influences process offspring four different crosses nymph-and worker-derived secondary reproductive individuals strongly differentiated caste sex ratios despite uniform rearing conditions data fit x-linked one-locus-two-allele model five possible genotypes one lethal two resulted workers two resulted either nymphs environmentally determined workers caste thus controlled environment complex genetic inheritance pattern
