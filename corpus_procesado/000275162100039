rtel enforces meiotic crossover interference homeostasis
meiotic crossovers cos tightly regulated ensure cos chromosome distributed far apart crossover interference coi least one co formed per homolog pair co homeostasis co formation controlled part meiotic double-strand break dsb creation caenorhabditis elegans second level control must also exist meiotic dsbs outnumber cos show anti-recombinase rtel required prevent excess meiotic cos probably promoting meiotic synthesis-dependent strand annealing two distinct classes meiotic cos increased rtel mutants coi homeostasis compromised propose rtel implements second level co control promoting noncrossovers
