tunability noise dependence differentiation dynamics 
dynamic process differentiation depends architecture quantitative parameters noise underlying genetic circuits however remains unclear elements combine control cellular behavior analyzed probabilistic transient differentiation bacillus subtilis cells state competence key parameters independently tuned frequency initiation duration competence episodes allowed circuit access different dynamic regimes including oscillation altering circuit architecture showed duration competence events can made precise used experimental method reduce global cellular noise showed noise levels correlated frequency differentiation events together data reveal noise-dependent circuit remarkably resilient tunable terms dynamic behavior
