three-dimensional atomic-scale structure size-selected gold nanoclusters 
unambiguous determination three-dimensional structure nanoparticles challenging electron tomography requires series images taken many different specimen orientations approach ideal stable stationary structures ultrasmall nanoparticles intrinsically structurally unstable may interact incident electron beam- constraining electron beam density can used duration observation use aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy coupled simple imaging simulation determine atomic resolution size three dimensional shape orientation atomic arrangement size selected gold nanoclusters preformed gas phase soft landed amorphous carbon substrate structures gold nanoclusters containing +/ atoms can identified either ino decahedral cuboctahedral icosahedral geometries comparison theoretical modelling system suggests structures consistent energetic considerations discovery nanoscale gold particles function active selective catalysts variety important chemical reactions provoked much research interest recent years- believe detailed structure information provide will help unravel role nanoclusters size structure-specific catalytic reactions note technique will use investigations supported ultrasmall metal cluster systems
