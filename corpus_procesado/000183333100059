nod1 detects unique muropeptide gram-negative bacterial peptidoglycan 
although role toll-like receptors extracellular bacterial sensing investigated intensively intracellular detection bacteria nod molecules remains largely uncharacterized show human nod1 specifically detects unique diaminopimelate-containing n-acetylglucosamine-n-acetylmuramic acid glcnac-murnac tripeptide motif found gram-negative bacterial peptidoglycan resulting activation transcription factor nf-kappab pathway moreover show epithelial cells represent first line defense invasive pathogens nod1 indispensable intracellular gram-negative bacterial sensing
