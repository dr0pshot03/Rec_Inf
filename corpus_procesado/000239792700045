hierarchy adaptivity segmenting visual scenes 
finding salient coherent regions images basis many visual tasks especially important object recognition human observers perform task ease relying system hierarchical processing seems critical role despite many attempts computerized algorithms- far demonstrated robust segmentation capabilities general viewing conditions describe new highly efficient approach determines salient regions image builds hierarchical structure algorithm segmentation weighted aggregation derived algebraic multigrid solvers physical systems consists fine-to-coarse pixel aggregation aggregates various sizes may may overlap revealed salient without predetermining number scale results using algorithm markedly accurate significantly faster linear data size previous approaches
