rev1 employs novel mechanism dna synthesis using protein template 
rev1 dna polymerase highly specialized incorporation c opposite template g present crystal structure yeast rev1 bound template g incoming -deoxycytidine -triphosphate dctp reveals polymerase dictates identity incoming nucleotide well identity templating base template g incoming dctp pair instead template g evicted dna helix makes optimal hydrogen bonds segment rev1 also unlike dna polymerases incoming dctp pairs arginine rather templating base ensures incorporation dctp incoming nucleotides mechanism provides elegant means promoting proficient error-free synthesis n--adducted guanines obstruct replication
