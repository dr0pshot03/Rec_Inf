microbial metabolites short-chain fatty acids regulate colonic t-reg cell homeostasis
regulatory t cells t-regs express transcription factor foxp3 critical regulating intestinal inflammation candidate microbe approaches identified bacterial species strain-specific molecules can affect intestinal immune responses including species modulate t-reg responses neither humans mice harbor bacterial strains posited prevalent factors exist regulate number function colonic t-regs determined short-chain fatty acids gut microbiota-derived bacterial fermentation products regulate size function colonic t-reg pool protect colitis ffar2-dependent manner mice study reveals class abundant microbial metabolites underlies adaptive immune microbiota coadaptation promotes colonic homeostasis health
