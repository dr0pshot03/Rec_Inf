learning action adaptive combination motor primitives
understanding brain constructs movements remains fundamental challenge neuroscience brain may control complex movements flexible combination motor primitives primitive element computation sensorimotor map transforms desired limb trajectories motor commands theoretical studies shown systems ability learn action depends shape primitives using time-series analysis error patterns show humans learn dynamics reaching movements flexible combination primitives gaussian-like tuning functions encoding hand velocity wide tuning inferred primitives predicts limitations brains ability represent viscous dynamics find close agreement predicted limitations subjects adaptation new force fields mathematical properties derived primitives resemble tuning curves purkinje cells cerebellum activity cells may encode primitives underlie learning dynamics
