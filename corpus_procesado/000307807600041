design stable nanocrystalline alloys 
nanostructured metals generally unstable grains grow rapidly even low temperatures rendering difficult process often unsuitable usage alloying found improve stability empirically discovered systems developed theoretical framework stable nanostructured alloys can designed nanostructure stability map based thermodynamic model applied design stable nanostructured tungsten alloys identify candidate alloy w-ti demonstrate substantially enhanced stability high-temperature long-duration conditions amenable powder-route production bulk nanostructured tungsten nanostructured alloy adopts heterogeneous chemical distribution anticipated present theoretical framework unexpected basis conventional bulk thermodynamics
