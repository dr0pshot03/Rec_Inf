global geometric framework nonlinear dimensionality reduction 
scientists working large volumes high-dimensional data global climate patterns stellar spectra human gene distributions regularly confront problem dimensionality reduction: finding meaningful low-dimensional structures hidden high-dimensional observations human brain confronts problem everyday perception extracting high-dimensional sensory inputs- auditory nerve fibers optic nerve fibers-a manageably small number perceptually relevant features describe approach solving dimensionality reduction problems uses easily measured local metric information learn underlying global geometry data set unlike classical techniques principal component analysis pca multidimensional scaling mds approach capable discovering nonlinear degrees freedom underlie complex natural observations human handwriting images face different viewing conditions contrast previous algorithms nonlinear dimensionality reduction ours efficiently computes globally optimal solution important class data manifolds guaranteed converge asymptotically true structure
