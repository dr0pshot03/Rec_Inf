chemotaxis network governs motion escherichia coli long studied gain general understanding signal transduction although pathway composed just components exhibits essential characteristics biological complexity adaptation response environmental signals studying intracellular networks experiments mathematical models- assumed network properties can inferred population measurements however approach masks underlying temporal fluctuations intracellular signalling events inferred fundamental properties chemotaxis network noise analysis behavioural variations individual bacteria show certain properties established population measurements adapted states conserved single-cell level: timescales ranging seconds several minutes behaviour non-stimulated cells exhibit temporal variations much larger expected statistical fluctuations find signalling network causes noise identify molecular events produce small changes concentration one key network component suppress temporal behavioural variability suggesting variability selected property adaptive system
