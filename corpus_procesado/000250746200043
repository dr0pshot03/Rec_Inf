discovery functional elements drosophila genomes using evolutionary signatures 
sequencing multiple related species followed comparative genomics analysis constitutes powerful approach systematic understanding genome use genomes drosophila species de novo discovery functional elements fly type functional element shows characteristic patterns change evolutionary signatures dictated precise selective constraints signatures enable recognition new protein-coding genes exons spurious incorrect gene annotations numerous unusual gene structures including abundant stop-codon readthrough similarly predict non-protein-coding rna genes structures new microrna mirna genes provide evidence mirna processing functionality hairpin arms dna strands identify several classes pre post-transcriptional regulatory motifs predict individual motif instances high confidence also study discovery power scales divergence number species compared provide general guidelines comparative studies
