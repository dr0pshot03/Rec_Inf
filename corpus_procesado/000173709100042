towards robust regional estimates co2 sources sinks using atmospheric transport models 
information regional carbon sources sinks can derived variations observed atmospheric co2 concentrations via inverse modelling atmospheric tracer transport models consensus yet reached regarding size distribution regional carbon fluxes obtained using approach partly owing use several different atmospheric transport models- report estimates surface atmosphere co2 fluxes intercomparison atmospheric co2 inversion models transcom project includes transport models model variants find uptake co2 southern extratropical ocean less estimated ocean measurements result sensitive transport models methodological approaches also find northern land carbon sink distributed relatively evenly among continents northern hemisphere results show sensitivity transport differences among models especially respond seasonal terrestrial exchange co2 overall carbon fluxes integrated latitudinal zones strongly constrained observations middle high latitudes significant constraints understanding regional carbon fluxes will therefore require improvements transport models expansion co2 observation network within tropics
