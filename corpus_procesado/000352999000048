systemic administration epothilone b promotes axon regeneration spinal cord injury
central nervous system cns injury inhibitory factors lesion scar poor axon growth potential prevent axon regeneration microtubule stabilization reduces scarring promotes axon growth however cellular mechanisms dual effect remain unclear delayed systemic administration blood-brain barrier-permeable microtubule-stabilizing drug epothilone b epob decreased scarring rodent spinal cord injury sci abrogating polarization directed migration scar-forming fibroblasts conversely epothilone b reactivated neuronal polarization inducing concerted microtubule polymerization axon tip propelled axon growth inhibitory environment together drug-elicited effects promoted axon regeneration improved motor function sci recent clinical approval epothilones hold promise clinical use cns injury
