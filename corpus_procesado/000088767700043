fear memories require protein synthesis amygdala reconsolidation retrieval
new memories initially labile sensitive disruption consolidated stable long-term memories- much evidence indicates consolidation involves synthesis new proteins neurons- lateral basal nuclei amygdala lba believed site memory storage fear learning infusion protein synthesis inhibitor anisomycin lba shortly training prevents consolidation fear memories show consolidated fear memories reactivated retrieval return labile state infusion anisomycin shortly memory reactivation produces amnesia later tests regardless whether reactivation performed days conditioning treatment anisomycin absence memory reactivation left memory intact consistent time-limited role protein synthesis production consolidation delay infusion six hours memory reactivation produced amnesia data show consolidated fear memories reactivated return labile state requires de novo protein synthesis reconsolidation findings predicted traditional theories memory consolidation
