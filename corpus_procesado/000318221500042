linking evolution body shape locomotor biomechanics bird-line archosaurs
locomotion living birds neornithes two remarkable features: feather-assisted flight use unusually crouched hindlimbs bipedal support movement defining functional traits evolved remains controversial- however advent computer modelling approaches discoveries exceptionally preserved key specimens now make possible use quantitative data whole-body morphology address biomechanics underlying issue use digital body reconstructions quantify evolutionary trends locomotor biomechanics whole-body proportions centre-of-mass position across clade archosauria use three-dimensional digital reconstruction estimate body shape skeletal dimensions archosaurs along ancestral bird line including exceptionally preserved feathered taxa microraptor archaeopteryx pengornis yixia-nornis represent key stages evolution avian body plan rather discrete transition more-upright postures basal-most birds avialae immediate outgroup deinonychosauria results support hypotheses gradual stepwise acquisition more-crouched limb postures across much theropod evolution- although find evidence accelerated change within clade maniraptora birds closest relatives deinonychosaurs addition whereas reduction tail widely accepted primary morphological factor correlated centre-of-mass position hence evolution hindlimb posture- instead find enlargement pectoral limb several associated trends much stronger influence intriguingly support onset accelerated morpho-functional trends within maniraptora closely correlated evolution flight find evolution enlarged forelimbs strongly linked via whole-body centre mass hindlimb function terrestrial locomotion suggest evolution avian flight linked anatomical novelties pelvic limb well pectoral
