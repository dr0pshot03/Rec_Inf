difficulty increasing dental complexity 
one fascinating aspects history life apparent increase morphological complexity time1 well known example mammalian cheek tooth evolution2- contrast experimental studies development readily show decrease complexity well exemplified mammalian teeth tooth crown features called cusps frequently lost mutant transgenic mice5- report mouse tooth complexity can increased substantially adjusting multiple signalling pathways simultaneously cultured teeth vitro adjusted ectodysplasin eda activin sonic hedgehog shh pathways individually required normal tooth development quantified tooth complexity using number cusps topographic measure surface complexity8 results show whereas activation eda activin signalling inhibition shh signalling individually cause subtle moderate increases complexity cusp number doubled three pathways adjusted unison furthermore increase cusp number result increase tooth size altered primary patterning phase development combination lack complex mutants5- paucity natural variants complex phenotypes9 results greatly increased dental complexity using multiple pathways suggests increase may inherently different decrease phenotypic complexity
