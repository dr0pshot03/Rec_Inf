difficulty increasing dental complexity
one fascinating aspects history life apparent increase morphological complexity time well known example mammalian cheek tooth evolution- contrast experimental studies development readily show decrease complexity well exemplified mammalian teeth tooth crown features called cusps frequently lost mutant transgenic mice- report mouse tooth complexity can increased substantially adjusting multiple signalling pathways simultaneously cultured teeth vitro adjusted ectodysplasin eda activin sonic hedgehog shh pathways individually required normal tooth development quantified tooth complexity using number cusps topographic measure surface complexity results show whereas activation eda activin signalling inhibition shh signalling individually cause subtle moderate increases complexity cusp number doubled three pathways adjusted unison furthermore increase cusp number result increase tooth size altered primary patterning phase development combination lack complex mutants- paucity natural variants complex phenotypes results greatly increased dental complexity using multiple pathways suggests increase may inherently different decrease phenotypic complexity
