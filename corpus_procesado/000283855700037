detection population submillimeter-bright strongly lensed galaxies 
gravitational lensing powerful astrophysical cosmological probe particularly valuable submillimeter wavelengths study statistical individual properties dusty star-forming galaxies however identification gravitational lenses often time-intensive involving sifting large volumes imaging spectroscopic data find candidates used early data herschel astrophysical terahertz large area survey demonstrate wide-area submillimeter surveys can simply easily detect strong gravitational lensing events close % efficiency
