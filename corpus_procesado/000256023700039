seismogenic lavas explosive eruption forecasting
volcanic dome-building episodes commonly exhibit acceleration effusive discharge rate seismicity explosive eruptions enable application material failure forecasting methods eruption forecasting date methods based exclusively seismicity country rock clear however rheology deformation rate lava ultimately dictate eruption style highly crystalline lavas involved eruptions pseudoplastic fluids exhibit strong component shear thinning deformation accelerates across ductile brittle transition thus understanding nature ductile-brittle transition dome lavas may well hold key accurate description dome growth stability present results rheological experiments continuous microseismic monitoring reveal dome lavas seismogenic character seismicity changes markedly across ductile-brittle transition complete brittle failure occurs high strain rates conclude magma seismicity combined failure forecasting methods potentially applied successfully dome-building eruptions volcanic forecasting
