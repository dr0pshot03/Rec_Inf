schizophrenia susceptibility gene dysbindin controls synaptic homeostasis 
molecular mechanisms achieve homeostatic stabilization neural function remain largely unknown better understand neural function stabilized development throughout life used electrophysiology-based forward genetic screen assessed function neuronally expressed genes role homeostatic modulation synaptic transmission drosophila screen ruled involvement numerous synaptic proteins identified critical function dysbindin gene linked schizophrenia humans found dysbindin required presynaptically retrograde homeostatic modulation neurotransmission functions dose-dependent manner downstream independently calcium influx thus dysbindin essential adaptive neural plasticity may link altered homeostatic signaling complex neurological disease
