holographic measurements inhomogeneous cloud mixing centimeter scale 
optical properties precipitation efficiency atmospheric clouds largely determined turbulent mixing environment cloud liquid water reduced upon mixing droplets may evaporate uniformly across population extreme subset droplets may evaporate completely leaving remaining drops unaffected use airborne holographic imaging visualize spatial structure droplet size distribution smallest turbulent scales thereby observing response entrainment mixing clear air measurements reveal turbulent clouds inhomogeneous sharp transitions cloud clear air properties persisting dissipative scales < centimeter local droplet size distribution fluctuates strongly number density nearly unchanging mean droplet diameter
