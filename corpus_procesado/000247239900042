wnt induces lrp6 signalosomes promotes dishevelled-dependent lrp6 phosphorylation
multiple signaling pathways including wnt signaling participate animal development stem cell biology human cancer although many components wnt pathway identified unresolved questions remain mechanism wnt binding receptors frizzled low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein lrp6 triggers downstream signaling events live imaging vertebrate cells show wnt treatment quickly induces plasma membrane-associated lrp6 aggregates lrp6 aggregates phosphorylated can detergent-solubilized ribosome-sized multiprotein complexes phospho-lrp6 aggregates contain wnt-pathway components common vesicular traffic markers except caveolin scaffold protein dishevelled dvl required lrp6 phosphorylation aggregation propose wnts induce coclustering receptors dvl lrp6-signalosomes turn triggers lrp6 phosphorylation promote axin recruitment beta-catenin stabilization
