regulation cytokine receptors golgi n-glycan processing endocytosis 
golgi enzyme beta16 n-acetylglucosaminyltransferase v mgat5 upregulated carcinomas promotes substitution n-glycan poly n-acetyllactosamine preferred ligand galectin- gal- report expression mgat5 sensitized mouse cells multiple cytokines gal- cross-linked mgat5-modified n-glycans epidermal growth factor transforming growth factor-beta receptors cell surface delayed removal constitutive endocytosis mgat5 expression mammary carcinoma rate limiting cytokine signaling consequently epithelial-mesenchymal transition cell motility tumor metastasis mgat5 also promoted cytokine-mediated leukocyte signaling phagocytosis extravasation vivo thus conditional regulation n-glycan processing drives synchronous modification cytokine receptors balances surface retention loss via endocytosis
