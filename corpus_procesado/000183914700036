effects basal debris glacier flow 
glacier movement resisted partially debris either within glaciers glaciers water-saturated layers experiments beneath thick sliding glacier ice containing % debris exerted shear traction kilopascals smooth rock bed comparable total shear traction beneath glaciers contrary usual assumption debris-bed friction negligible imposed pore-water pressure % normal stress subglacial debris layer reduced shear traction debris sufficiently halt deformation cause slip ice debris slip resistance thus less debris shearing resistance
