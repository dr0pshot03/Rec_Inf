lithium isotope evidence subduction-enriched mantle source mid-ocean-ridge basalts
recycled crustal materials returned earths surface mantle subduction long invoked explain compositional heterogeneity upper mantle yet increasingly problems noted model debate can definitively addressed using stable isotope ratios significantly vary primitive mantle-derived materials consequence recycling present data showing notable range lithium isotope ratios basalts east pacific rise correlate traditional indices mantle heterogeneity example nd-/nd ratios co-variations stable radiogenic isotopes melts normal ridge segment provide critical evidence importance recycled material generating chemical heterogeneity upper mantle contrary many models however elevated lithium isotope ratios enriched east pacific rise lavas imply subducted ocean crust agent enrichment instead suggest fluid-modified mantle enriched residency subduction zone mixed back upper mantle cause compositional variability
