single-cell genomics reveals organismal interactions uncultivated marine protists 
whole-genome shotgun sequence data three individual cells isolated seawater followed analysis ribosomal dna indicated cells represented three divergent clades picobiliphytes contrast recent description phylum found evidence plastid dna nuclear-encoded plastid-targeted proteins suggests picobiliphytes heterotrophs genome data one cell dominated sequences widespread single-stranded dna virus virus absent two cells contained non-eukaryote dna derived marine bacteroidetes large dna viruses using shotgun sequencing uncultured marine picobiliphytes revealed distinct interactions individual cells
