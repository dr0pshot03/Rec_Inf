direct observation structure-function relationship nucleic acid-processing enzyme 
relationship protein three-dimensional structure function essential mechanism determination unfortunately techniques provide direct measurement relationship structural data typically limited static pictures function must inferred conversely functional assays usually provide little information structural conformation developed single-molecule technique combining optical tweezers fluorescence microscopy allows measurements simultaneously present measurements uvrd dna repair helicase directly unambiguously reveal connection structure function data reveal uvrd exhibits two distinct types unwinding activity regulated stoichiometry furthermore two uvrd conformational states termed "closed" "open" correlate movement toward away dna fork
