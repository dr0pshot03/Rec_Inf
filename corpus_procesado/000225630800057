crystal structure photolyase bound cpd-like dna lesion situ repair 
dna photolyases use light energy repair dna comprises ultrarviolet-induced lesions cis-syn cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers cpds report crystal structure dna photolyase bound duplex dna bent 50degrees comprises synthetic cpd lesion cpd lesion flipped active site split two thymines synchrotron radiation k although photolyases catalyze blue light-driven cpd cleavage k structure apparently mimics structural substate light-driven dna repair back-flipping thymines duplex dna yet taken place
