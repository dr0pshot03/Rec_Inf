persistently variable background stratospheric aerosol layer global climate change 
recent measurements demonstrate background stratospheric aerosol layer persistently variable rather constant even absence major volcanic eruptions several independent data sets show stratospheric aerosols increased abundance since near-global satellite aerosol data imply negative radiative forcing due stratospheric aerosol changes period watt per square meter reducing recent global warming otherwise occurred observations earlier periods limited suggest additional negative radiative forcing watt per square meter climate model projections neglecting changes continue overestimate radiative forcing global warming coming decades aerosols remain present current values increase
