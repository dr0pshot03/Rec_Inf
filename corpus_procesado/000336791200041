electrically driven nuclear spin resonance single-molecule magnets 
recent advances addressing isolated nuclear spins opened path toward using nuclear-spin-based quantum bits local magnetic fields normally used coherently manipulate state nuclear spin; however electrical manipulation allow fast switching spatially confined spin control propose demonstrate coherent single nuclear spin manipulation using electric fields direct coupling spin electric field make use hyperfine stark effect magnetic field transducer atomic level quantum-mechanical process present nuclear spin systems phosphorus bismuth atoms silicon offers general route toward electrical control nuclear-spin-based devices
