isolated compact elliptical galaxies: stellar systems ran away 
compact elliptical galaxies form rare class stellar system similar presently known characterized high stellar densities small sizes often harboring metal-rich stars thought form tidal stripping massive progenitors two isolated objects discovered massive galaxies performing stripping identified mining astronomical survey data now found compact elliptical galaxies types environment share similar dynamical stellar population properties dynamical analysis nonisolated galaxies demonstrates feasibility ejection host clusters groups three-body encounters agreement numerical simulations hence isolated compact elliptical isolated quiescent dwarf galaxies tidally stripped systems ran away hosts
