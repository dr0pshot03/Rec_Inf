periodic chaotic doubled earthquake recurrence intervals deep san andreas fault 
earthquake recurrence histories may provide clues timing future events long intervals large events obscure full recurrence variability contrast small earthquakes occur frequently recurrence intervals quantifiable much shorter time scale work examine -year sequence recurring low-frequency earthquake bursts composing tremor beneath san andreas fault near parkfield california events exhibit tightly clustered recurrence intervals times oscillate similar similar days patterns sometimes change abruptly although environments large low-frequency earthquakes different observations suggest similar complexity might underlie sequences large earthquakes
