prolyl isomerase pin1 reveals mechanism control p53 functions genotoxic insults 
tumour suppressor p53 important cell decision either arrest cell cycle progression induce apoptosis response variety stimuli p53 post-translational modifications association proteins implicated regulation stability transcriptional activities report dna damage p53 interacts pin1 peptidyl-prolyl isomerase regulates function many proteins involved cell cycle control apoptosis- interaction strictly dependent p53 phosphorylation requires ser thr ser binding pin1 generates conformational changes p53 enhancing transactivation activity stabilization p53 impaired uv-treated pin1-/- cells owing inability efficiently dissociate mdm2 consequence reduced p53-dependent response detected pin1-/- cells correlates diminished transcriptional activation p53-regulated genes results suggest following stress-induced phosphorylation p53 needs form complex pin1 undergo conformational change fulfil biological roles
