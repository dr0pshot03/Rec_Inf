rapid growth seed black holes early universe supra-exponential accretion 
mass accretion black holes bhs typically capped eddington rate radiations push balances gravitys pull however even exponential growth eddington-limited e-folding time te similar x billion years slow grow stellar-mass bh seeds supermassive luminous quasars observed universe billion years old propose dynamical mechanism can trigger supra-exponential accretion early universe bh seed bound star cluster fed ubiquitous dense cold gas flows high gas opacity traps accretion radiation low-mass bhs random motions suppress formation slowly draining accretion disk supra-exponential growth can thus explain puzzling emergence supermassive bhs power luminous quasars soon big bang
