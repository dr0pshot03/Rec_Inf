tau reduction prevents beta-induced defects axonal transport 
amyloid-beta beta peptides derived amyloid precursor protein microtubule-associated protein tau key pathogenic factors alzheimers disease ad exactly impair cognitive functions unknown assessed effects beta tau axonal transport mitochondria neurotrophin receptor trka cargoes critical neuronal function survival whose distributions altered ad beta oligomers rapidly inhibited axonal transport cargoes wild-type neurons lowering tau levels prevented defects without affecting baseline axonal transport thus beta requires tau impair axonal transport tau reduction protects beta-induced axonal transport defects
