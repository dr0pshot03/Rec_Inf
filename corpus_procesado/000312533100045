evolutionary landscape alternative splicing vertebrate species
species similar repertoires protein-coding genes differ markedly phenotypic level poorly understood comparing organ transcriptomes vertebrate species spanning similar million years evolution observed significant differences alternative splicing complexity vertebrate lineages highest complexity primates within million years splicing profiles physiologically equivalent organs diverged strongly related identity species organ type vertebrate species-specific splicing patterns cis-directed however subset pronounced splicing changes predicted remodel protein interactions involving trans-acting regulators events likely contributed diversification splicing transcriptomic changes underlie phenotypic differences among vertebrate species
