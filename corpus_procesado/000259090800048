neural correlates computation behavioural impact decision confidence 
humans animals must often make decisions basis imperfect evidence statisticians use measures p values assign degrees confidence propositions little known brain computes confidence estimates decisions explored issue using behavioural analysis neural recordings rats combination computational modelling subjects trained perform odour categorization task allowed decision confidence manipulated varying distance test stimulus category boundary understand confidence computed along choice using standard models decision-making- defined simple measure quantified quality evidence contributing particular decision show firing rates many single neurons orbitofrontal cortex match closely predictions confidence models readily explained alternative mechanisms learning stimulus outcome associations- moreover tested using delayed reward version task found rats willingness wait rewards increased confidence predicted theoretical model results indicate confidence estimates previously suggested require metacognition conscious awareness available even rodent brain can computed relatively simple operations can drive adaptive behaviour suggest confidence estimation may fundamental ubiquitous component decision making
