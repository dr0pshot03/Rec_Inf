martian meteorite launch: high-speed ejecta small craters
performed high-resolution computer simulations impacts homogeneous layered martian terrain analogs try account ages characteristics martian meteorite collection found earth found craters small similar to3 kilometers can eject similar to10 decimeter-sized fragments mars enough expect fragments appear terrestrial collection minimum crater diameter least four times smaller previous estimates depends physical composition target material terrain covered weak layer impact-generated regolith requires larger therefore rarer impacts eject meteorites older terrain likely mantled material estimate martian meteorites will biased toward younger ages consistent meteorite collection
