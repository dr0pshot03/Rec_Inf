electronic reconstruction interface mott insulator band insulator 
surface science important well-established branch materials science involving study changes material properties near surface interface fundamental issue atomic reconstruction: surface lattice symmetry differs bulk correlated-electron compounds materials strong electron-electron electron-lattice interactions produce new electronic phases including interaction-induced mott insulators many forms spin charge orbital ordering presumably high-transition-temperature superconductivity12 propose fundamental issue new field correlated-electron surface/interface science electronic reconstruction: surface/interface electronic phase differ bulk step towards general understanding phenomena present theoretical study interface strongly correlated mott insulator band insulator find dramatic interface-induced electronic reconstructions: wide parameter ranges near-interface region metallic ferromagnetic whereas bulk phase either side insulating anti-ferromagnetic extending analysis wider range interfaces surfaces fundamental scientific challenge may lead new applications correlated electron materials
