formation kuiper belt outward transport bodies neptunes migration
dynamically cold kuiper belt consists objects low-inclination orbits similar to40 similar to50 au sun currently contains material totalling less tenth mass earth surprisingly low according accretion models objects grown present size unless cold kuiper belt originally contained tens earth masses solids although several mechanisms proposed produce observed mass depletion significant limitations show objects currently observed dynamically cold kuiper belt probably formed within similar to35 au subsequently pushed outward neptunes : mean motion resonance final phase migration combining mechanism previous work conclude entire kuiper belt formed closer sun transported outward final stages planet formation
