tailoring electrical transport across grain boundaries polycrystalline graphene
graphene produced chemical vapor deposition cvd polycrystalline scattering charge carriers grain boundaries gbs degrade performance relative exfoliated single-crystal graphene however electrical properties gbs far addressed indirectly without simultaneous knowledge locations structures present electrical measurements individual gbs cvd graphene first imaged transmission electron microscopy unexpectedly electrical conductance improves one order magnitude gbs better interdomain connectivity study suggests polycrystalline graphene good stitching may allow uniformly high electrical performance rivaling exfoliated samples demonstrate using optimized growth conditions device geometry
