three-dimensional deformation caused bam iran earthquake origin shallow slip deficit 
understanding earthquake process requires detailed insights tectonic stresses accumulated released seismogenic faults derive full vector displacement field due bam iran earthquake moment magnitude using radar data envisat satellite european space agency analysis surface deformation indicates seismic moment release along km-long strike-slip rupture occurred shallow depth km yet rupture break surface bam event may therefore represent end-member case shallow slip deficit model postulates coseismic slip uppermost crust systematically less seismogenic depths km insar-derived surface displacement data bam large shallow earthquakes suggest uppermost section seismogenic crust around young developing faults may undergo distributed failure interseismic period thereby accumulating little elastic strain
