motor side depth vision 
achieve stereoscopic vision brain must search corresponding image features two retinas1 long eyes stay still corresponding features confined narrow bands called epipolar lines23 eyes change position epipolar lines migrate retinas4- rnd matching features brain must either search different retinal bands depending current eye position search retina-fixed zones large enough cover usual locations epipolar lines show using new type stereogram depth image vanishes certain gaze elevations search zones retina-fixed case motor control acquires crucial function depth vision: show eyes twist lines sight way reduces motion epipolar lines allowing stereopsis get smaller search zones thereby lightening computational load
