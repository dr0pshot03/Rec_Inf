viral rna structural element alters host recognition nonself rna
although interferon ifn signaling induces genes limit viral infection many pathogenic viruses overcome host response example -o methylation cap viral rna subverts mammalian antiviral responses evading restriction ifit1 ifn-stimulated gene regulates protein synthesis however alphaviruses replicate efficiently cells expressing ifit1 even though genomic rna cap lacking -o methylation show pathogenic alphaviruses use secondary structural motifs within untranslated region utr rna alter ifit1 binding function mutations within -utr affecting rna structural elements enabled restriction antagonism ifit1 vitro vivo results identify evasion mechanism viruses use rna structural motifs avoid immune restriction
