linkage disequilibrium human genome 
availability dense genome-wide map single nucleotide polymorphisms snps central issue human genetics whether now possible use linkage disequilibrium ld map genes cause disease ld refers correlations among neighbouring alleles reflecting haplotypes descended single ancestral chromosomes size ld blocks subject considerable debate computer simulations empirical data suggested ld extends kilobases kb around common snps whereas data suggested can extend much cases greater kb- difficult obtain systematic picture ld past studies based - loci different populations report large-scale experiment using uniform protocol examine randomly selected genomic regions ld united states population north-european descent typically extends kb common alleles implying ld mapping likely practical population contrast ld nigerian population extends markedly less far results illuminate human history suggesting ld northern europeans shaped marked demographic event - years ago
