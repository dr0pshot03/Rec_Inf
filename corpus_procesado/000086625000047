ion permeation mechanism potassium channel
ion-selective channels enable specific permeation ions cell membranes provide basis several important biological functions example electric signalling nervous system although large amount electrophysiological data available molecular mechanisms channels can mediate ion transport remain significant unsolved problem recently determined crystal structure representative k+ channel kcsa streptomyces lividans becomes possible examine ion conduction pathways microscopic level k+ channels utilize multi-ion conduction mechanisms- three-dimensional structure also shows several ions present channel report results molecular dynamics free energy perturbation calculations establish nature multiple ion conduction mechanism yield correct ion selectivity channel evaluating energetics relevant occupancy states selectivity filter rnd favoured conduction pathway involves transitions two main states free difference kcal mol- putative permeation pathways can excluded involve states high energy
