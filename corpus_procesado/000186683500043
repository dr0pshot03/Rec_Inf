design novel globular protein fold atomic-level accuracy
major challenge computational protein design creation novel proteins arbitrarily chosen three-dimensional structures used general computational strategy iterates sequence design structure prediction design residue alpha/beta protein called top7 novel sequence topology top7 found experimentally folded extremely stable x-ray crystal structure top7 similar root mean square deviation equals angstroms design model ability design new protein fold makes possible exploration large regions protein universe yet observed nature
