global estimate aerosol direct radiative forcing satellite measurements 
atmospheric aerosols cause scattering absorption incoming solar radiation additional anthropogenic aerosols released atmosphere thus exert direct radiative forcing climate system degree present-day aerosol forcing estimated global models incorporate representation aerosol cycles- although models compared validated observations estimates remain uncertain previous satellite measurements direct effect aerosols contained limited information aerosol type confined oceans use state-of-the-art satellite-based measurements aerosols- surface wind speed estimate clear-sky direct radiative forcing incorporating measurements land ocean use monte carlo approach account uncertainties aerosol measurements algorithm used probability density functions obtained direct radiative forcing top atmosphere give clear-sky global annual average w m- standard deviation +/- w m- results suggest present-day direct radiative forcing stronger present model estimates implying future atmospheric warming greater presently predicted aerosol emissions continue decline
