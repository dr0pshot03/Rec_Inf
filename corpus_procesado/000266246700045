human k-complex represents isolated cortical down-state 
electroencephalogram eeg mainstay clinical neurology tightly correlated brain function specific currents generating human eeg elements remain poorly specified lack microphysiological recordings largest event healthy human eegs k-complex kc occurs slow-wave sleep show kcs generated widespread cortical areas outward dendritic currents middle upper cortical layers accompanied decreased broadband eeg power decreased neuronal firing demonstrate steep decline network activity thus kcs isolated "down-states" fundamental cortico-thalamic processing mode already characterized animals correspondence compatible proposed contributions kc sleep preservation memory consolidation
