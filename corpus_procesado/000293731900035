c grasses prosper carbon dioxide eliminates desiccation warmed semi-arid grassland 
global warming predicted induce desiccation many world regions increases evaporative demand- rising co2 may counter trend improving plant water-use efficiency however clear important co2-enhanced water use efficiency might offsetting warming-induced desiccation higher co2 also leads higher plant biomass therefore greater transpirational surface furthermore although warming predicted favour warm-season c grasses rising co2 favour c- cool-season plants show semi-arid grassland elevated co2 can completely reverse desiccating effects moderate warming although enrichment air p p m v co2 increased soil water content swc / degrees c day/night warming resulted desiccation combined co2 enrichment warming effect swc relative control plots predicted elevated co2 favoured c grasses enhanced stand productivity whereas warming favoured c grasses combined warming co2 enrichment stimulated above-ground growth c grasses years soil moisture limited plant productivity results indicate warmer co2-enriched world swc productivity semi-arid grasslands may higher previously expected
