entrainment circadian clock liver feeding
circadian rhythms behavior driven oscillators brain coupled environmental light cycle circadian rhythms gene expression occur widely peripheral organs unclear multiple rhythms coupled together form coherent system study coupling investigated effects cycles food availability exert powerful entraining effects behavior rhythms gene expression liver lung suprachiasmatic nucleus scn used transgenic rat model whose tissues express luciferase vitro although rhythmicity scn remained phase-locked light-dark cycle restricted feeding rapidly entrained liver shifting rhythm hours within days results demonstrate feeding cycles can entrain liver independently scn light cycle suggest need reexamine mammalian circadian hierarchy also raise possibility peripheral circadian oscillators like liver may coupled scn primarily rhythmic behavior feeding
