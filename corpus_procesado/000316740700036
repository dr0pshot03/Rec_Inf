terradynamics legged locomotion granular media
theories aero hydrodynamics predict animal movement device design air water computation lift drag thrust forces although models terrestrial legged locomotion focused interactions solid ground many animals move substrates flow response intrusion however locomotor-ground interaction models flowable ground often unavailable developed force model arbitrarily-shaped legs bodies moving freely granular media used terradynamics predict small legged robots locomotion granular media using various leg shapes stride frequencies study reveals complex generic dependence stresses granular media intruder depth orientation movement direction gives insight effects leg morphology kinematics movement
