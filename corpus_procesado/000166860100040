surface-directed liquid flow inside microchannels
self-assembled monolayer chemistry used combination either multistream laminar flow photolithography pattern surface free energies inside microchannel networks aqueous liquids introduced patterned channels confined hydrophilic pathways provided pressure maintained critical value maximum pressure determined surface free energy liquid advancing contact angle liquid hydrophobic regions channel depth surface-directed liquid flow used create pressure-sensitive switches inside channel networks ability confine liquid flow inside microchannels two physical walls expected useful applications large gas-liquid interface critical demonstrated gas-liquid reaction
