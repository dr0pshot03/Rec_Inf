ferroelectric columnar liquid crystal featuring confined polar groups within core-shell architecture
ferroelectric liquid crystals materials remnant electrically invertible polar order columnar liquid crystals ferroelectric nature potential use ultrahigh-density memory devices electrical polarization occurs along columnar axis however columnar liquid crystals axial nonzero polarization zero electric field electrical invertibility demonstrated report ferroelectric response columnar liquid crystal adopting core-shell architecture accommodates array polar cyano groups confined hydrogen-bonded amide network optimal strength applied electric field columns core cyano groups align unidirectionally thereby developing extremely large macroscopic remnant polarization
