hidden costs infection: chronic malaria accelerates telomere degradation senescence wild birds
recovery infection always complete mild chronic infection may persist although direct costs infections apparently small potential long-term effects darwinian fitness poorly understood wild population great reed warblers found low-level chronic malaria infection reduced life span well lifetime number quality offspring delayed fitness effects malaria appear mediated telomere degradation result supported controlled infection experiments birds captivity results study imply chronic infection may causing series small adverse effects accumulate eventually impair phenotypic quality darwinian fitness
