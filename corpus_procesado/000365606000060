death drought tropical forests triggered hydraulics carbon starvation 
drought threatens tropical rainforests seasonal decadal timescales- drivers tree mortality following drought remain poorly understood suggested reduced availability non-structural carbohydrates nsc critically increases mortality risk insufficient carbon supply metabolism carbon starvation however little known nsc stores affected drought especially long term whether important hydraulic processes determining drought-induced mortality using data worlds longest-running experimental drought study tropical rainforest brazilian amazon test whether carbon starvation deterioration water-conducting pathways soil leaf trigger tree mortality biomass loss mortality experimentally droughted forest increased substantially > years reduced soil moisture availability mortality signal dominated death large trees much greater risk hydraulic deterioration smaller trees however find evidence droughted trees suffered carbon starvation nsc concentrations similar non-droughted trees growth rates decline either living dying trees results indicate hydraulics rather carbon starvation triggers tree death drought tropical rainforest
