viscosity-enhanced mechanism biogenic ocean mixing 
recent observations biologically generated turbulence ocean led conflicting conclusions regarding significance contribution animal swimming ocean mixing measurements indicate elevated turbulent dissipation-comparable levels caused winds tides-in vicinity large populations planktonic animals swimming together however also noted elevated turbulent dissipation insufficient proof substantial biogenic mixing much turbulent kinetic energy small animals injected ozmidov buoyancy length scale primarily dissipated heat fluid viscosity can affect ocean mixing ongoing debate regarding biogenic mixing focused comparisons animal wake turbulence ocean turbulence show second previously neglected mechanism fluid mixing-first described years ago charles darwin-is dominant mechanism mixing swimming animals efficiency mixing darwins mechanism dependent animal shape rather fluid length scale unlike turbulent wake mixing enhanced fluid viscosity therefore provides means biogenic mixing can equally effective small zooplankton large mammals theoretical model relative contributions darwinian mixing turbulent wake mixing created validated situ field measurements swimming jellyfish using newly developed scuba-based laser velocimetry device extrapolation results animals straightforward given knowledge animal shape orientation vertical migration basis calculations broad range aquatic animal species conclude biogenic mixing via darwins mechanism can significant contributor ocean mixing nutrient transport
