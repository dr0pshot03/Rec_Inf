elastic turbulence polymer solution flow 
turbulence ubiquitous phenomenon fully understood known flow simple newtonian fluid likely turbulent reynolds number large typically velocity high viscosity low size tank large12 contrast viscoelastic fluids3 solutions flexible long-chain polymers nonlinear mechanical properties therefore may expected behave differently observe experimentally flow sufficiently elastic polymer solution can become irregular even low velocity high viscosity small tank fluid motion excited broad range spatial temporal scales observe increase flow resistance factor twenty although reynolds number may arbitrarily low observed flow main features developed turbulence comparable state turbulent flow newtonian fluid pipe reynolds number high refs low reynolds number elastic turbulence observe accompanied significant stretching polymer molecules resulting increase elastic stresses two orders magnitude
