role hec1 spindle checkpoint signaling kinetochore recruitment mad1/mad2
spindle checkpoint delays sister chromatid separation chromosomes undergone bipolar spindle attachment checkpoint failure may result chromosome mis-segregation may contribute tumorigenesis showed human protein hec1 required recruitment mps1 kinase mad1/mad2 complexes kinetochores depletion hec1 impaired chromosome congression caused persistent activation spindle checkpoint indicating high steady-state levels mad1/mad2 complexes kinetochores essential checkpoint signaling simultaneous depletion hec1 mad2 caused catastrophic mitotic exit making hec1 attractive target selective elimination spindle checkpoint deficient cells
