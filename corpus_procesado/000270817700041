measurement charge current magnetic monopoles spin ice 
transport electrically charged quasiparticles based electrons ions plays pivotal role modern technology well determining essential functions biological organisms contrast transport magnetic charges barely explored experimentally mainly magnetic charges contrast electric ones generally considered best convenient macroscopic parameters12 rather well-defined quasiparticles however recently proposed magnetic charges can exist certain materials form emergent excitations manifest like point charges magnetic monopoles3 address question whether magnetic charges associated currents-magnetricity-can measured directly experiment without recourse material-specific theory mapping problem onto onsagers theory electrolytes4 show indeed possible devise appropriate method measurement magnetic charges dynamics using muon spin rotation suitable local probe apply method real material spin ice dy2ti2o7 refs - experimental measurements prove magnetic charges exist material interact via coulomb potential measurable currents characterize deviations ohms law determine elementary unit magnetic charge mub angstrom- equal recently predicted using microscopic theory spin ice3 measurement magnetic charge magnetic current establishes instance perfect symmetry electricity magnetism
