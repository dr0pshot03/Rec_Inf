synaptotagmin modulation fusion pore kinetics regulated exocytosis dense-core vesicles
exocytosis neurotransmitter fusion pore opening represents first instant fluid contact vesicle lumen extracellular space existence fusion pore established electrical measurements molecular composition unknown possibility synaptotagmin regulates fusion pores investigated amperometry monitor exocytosis single dense-core vesicles overexpression synaptotagmin prolonged time fusion pore opening dilation whereas synaptotagmin iv shortened time synaptotagmin isoforms reduced norepinephrine flux open fusion pores thus synaptotagmin interacts fusion pores possibly associating core complex membrane proteins and/or lipid
