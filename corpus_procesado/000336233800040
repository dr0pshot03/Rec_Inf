antibodies pfsea block parasite egress rbcs protect malaria infection
novel vaccines urgently needed reduce burden severe malaria using differential whole-proteome screening method identified plasmodium falciparum schizont egress antigen pfsea- kilodalton parasite antigen expressed schizont-infected red blood cells rbcs antibodies pfsea decreased parasite replication arresting schizont rupture conditional disruption pfsea resulted profound parasite replication defect vaccination mice recombinant plasmodium berghei pbsea significantly reduced parasitemia delayed mortality lethal challenge plasmodium berghei strain anka tanzanian children antibodies recombinant pfsea-1a rpfsea-1a experience severe malaria kenyan adolescents adults antibodies rpfsea-1a significantly lower parasite densities individuals without antibodies blocking schizont egress pfsea may synergize vaccines targeting hepatocyte rbc invasion
