enhanced sensitivity photodetection via quantum illumination
use quantum mechanically entangled light illuminate objects can provide substantial enhancements unentangled light detecting imaging objects presence high levels noise loss signal sent entangled ancilla retained detection takes place via entangling measurement returning signal together ancilla paper shows photodetection quantum illumination m bits entanglement can principle increase effective signal noise ratio factor m exponential improvement unentangled illumination enhancement persists even noise loss great entanglement survives detector
