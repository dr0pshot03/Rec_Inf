direct observation percolation manganite thin film
upon cooling isolated ferromagnetic domains thin films la033pr034ca033mno3 start grow merge metal-insulator transition temperature t-p1 leading steep drop resistivity continue grow far t-p1 contrast upon warming ferromagnetic domain size remains unchanged near transition temperature jump resistivity results decrease average magnetization ferromagnetic domains almost disappear temperature t-p2 higher t-p1 showing local magnetic hysteresis agreement resistivity hysteresis even well t-p2 ferromagnetic domains higher transition temperatures observed indicating magnetic inhomogeneity results may shed light origin magnetoresistance materials
