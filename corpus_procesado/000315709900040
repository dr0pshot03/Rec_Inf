topological quantum computation-from basic concepts first experiments
quantum computation requires controlled engineering quantum states perform tasks go beyond possible classical computers topological quantum computation aims achieve goal using non-abelian quantum phases matter phases allow quantum information stored manipulated nonlocal manner protects imperfections implemented protocols interactions environment recently substantial progress field made theoretical experimental fronts review basic concepts non-abelian phases topologically protected use quantum information processing tasks discuss different possible realizations concepts experimentally available solid-state systems including systems hosting majorana fermions recently proposed fractional counterparts non-abelian quantum hall states
