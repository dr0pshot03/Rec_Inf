recruitment 19s proteasome subcomplex activated promoter 
19s proteasome regulatory particle plays critical role cellular proteolysis however recent reports demonstrated 19s proteins play nonproteolytic role nucleotide excision repair transcription elongation show chromatin immunoprecipitation assays proteins comprising 19s complex recruited gal1- promoter gal4 transactivator upon induction galactose recruited complex contain proteins 20s proteolytic particle includes subset 19s proteins subset also specifically retained extract gal4 activation domain data indicate vivo base 19s complex functions independently larger complex plays direct nonproteolytic role rna polymerase ii transcription
