near-field interference unidirectional excitation electromagnetic guided modes
wave interference fundamental manifestation superposition principle numerous applications although conventional optics interference occurs waves undergoing different phase advances propagation show vectorial structure near field emitter essential controlling radiation interferes interaction mediating object demonstrate near-field interference circularly polarized dipole results unidirectional excitation guided electromagnetic modes near field preferred far-field radiation direction mimicking dipole single illuminated slit gold film measured unidirectional surface-plasmon excitation spatially symmetric structure surface wave direction switchable polarization
