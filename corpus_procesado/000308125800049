network context selection evolution enzyme specificity
enzymes thought evolved highly specific catalytic activities promiscuous ancestral proteins analyzing genome-scale model escherichia coli metabolism found % enzymes act variety substrates catalyze % known metabolic reactions however apparent generalist enzymes remain show marked differences generalist enzymes specialist enzymes known catalyze single chemical reaction one particular substrate vivo specialist enzymes frequently essential ii maintain higher metabolic flux iii require regulation enzyme activity control metabolic flux dynamic environments generalist enzymes furthermore properties conserved archaea eukarya thus metabolic network context environmental conditions influence enzyme evolution toward high specificity
