structural basis transcription activation: cap-alpha ctd-dna complex 
escherichia coli catabolite activator protein cap activates transcription p-lac p-gal promoters interactions rna polymerase alpha subunit carboxyl-terminal domain alphactd determined crystal structure cap-alphactd-dna complex resolution angstroms cap makes direct protein-protein interactions alphactd alphactd makes direct protein-dna interactions dna segment adjacent dna site cap large-scale conformational changes cap alphactd interface cap alphactd small findings consistent proposal activation involves simple "recruitment" mechanism
