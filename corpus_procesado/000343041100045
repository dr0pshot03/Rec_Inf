ion permeation k+ channels occurs direct coulomb knock-on 
potassium channels selectively conduct k+ ions across cellular membranes extraordinary efficiency selectivity filter exhibits four binding sites approximately equal electron density crystal structures high k+ concentrations previously thought reflect superposition alternating ion-and water-occupied states consequently cotranslocation ions water become widely accepted ion conduction mechanism potassium channels analyzing permeation events molecular dynamics simulations physiological voltages observed instead permeation occurs via ion-ion contacts neighboring k+ ions coulomb repulsion adjacent ions found key high-efficiency k+ conduction crystallographic data consistent directly neighboring k+ ions selectivity filter model offers intuitive explanation high throughput rates k+ channels
