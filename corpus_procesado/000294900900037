primary alcohols terminal olefins: formal anti-markovnikov hydration via triple relay catalysis
alcohol synthesis critical chemical pharmaceutical industries addition water across olefins form primary alcohols anti-markovnikov olefin hydration broadly useful reaction largely proven elusive indirect hydroboration/oxidation sequence requiring stoichiometric borane oxidant currently practical methodology report direct approach use triple relay catalysis system couples palladium-catalyzed oxidation acid-catalyzed hydrolysis ruthenium-catalyzed reduction cycles aryl-substituted terminal olefins converted primary alcohols net reaction water good yield excellent regioselectivity
