sox2 required sensory organ development mammalian inner ear 
sensory hair cells associated non-sensory supporting cells inner ear fundamental hearing balance arise common progenitor little known molecular events specifying cell lineage recently identified two allelic mouse mutants light coat circling lcc yellow submarine ysb show hearing balance impairment lcc/lcc mice completely deaf whereas ysb/ysb mice severely hearing impaired report inner ears lcc/lcc mice fail establish prosensory domain neither hair cells supporting cells differentiate resulting severe inner ear malformation whereas sensory epithelium ysb/ysb mice shows abnormal development disorganized fewer hair cells phenotypes due absence lcc mutants reduced expression ysb mutants transcription factor sox2 specifically within developing inner ear sox2 continues expressed inner ears mice lacking math1 also known atoh1 hath1 gene essential hair cell differentiation whereas math1 expression absent lcc mutants suggesting sox2 acts upstream math1
