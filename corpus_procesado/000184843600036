remote triggering deep earthquakes tonga sequences
well established earthquake earths crust can trigger subsequent earthquakes triggering documented deeper earthquakes models shallow fault interactions suggest static permanent stress changes can trigger nearby earthquakes within fault lengths causative earthquake- whereas dynamic transient stresses carried seismic waves may trigger earthquakes nearby remote distances- present detailed analysis august tonga deep earthquake sequences show evidence static dynamic triggering seven minutes magnitude earthquake occurred depth km magnitude earthquake km depth occurred km away previously aseismic region found nearby aftershocks first mainshock preferentially located regions static stresses predicted enhanced mainshock second mainshock triggered events located larger distances static stress increases negligible thus suggesting dynamic triggering origin times triggered events correspond arrival times main seismic waves mainshocks dynamically triggered earthquakes frequently occur aseismic regions adjacent seismic zone propose events triggered transient effects regions near criticality earthquakes difficulty nucleating without external influences
