genome-wide linkage association scan reveals novel loci autism 
although autism highly heritable neurodevelopmental disorder attempts identify specific susceptibility genes thus far met limited success1 genome-wide association studies using half million markers particularly large sample sizes achieved meta-analysis shown great success mapping genes complex genetic traits consequently initiated linkage association mapping study using half million genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms snps common set multiplex autism families affected offspring identified regions suggestive significant linkage chromosomes 6q27 20p13 respectively initial analysis yield genome-wide significant associations; however genotyping top hits additional families revealed snp chromosome 5p15 sema5a tas2r1 significantly associated autism p x - also demonstrated expression sema5a reduced brains autistic patients implicating sema5a autism susceptibility gene linkage regions reported provide targets rare variation screening whereas discovery single novel association demonstrates action common variants
