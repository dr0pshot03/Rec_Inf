nitric oxide regulates heart spatial confinement nitric oxide synthase isoforms
subcellular localization nitric oxide synthases effector molecules important regulatory mechanism signalling heart inhibits l-type ca2+ channels stimulates sarcoplasmic reticulum sr ca2+ release- leading variable effects myocardial contractility show spatial confinement specific synthase isoforms regulates process endothelial synthase nos3 localizes caveolae- compartmentalization beta-adrenergic receptors l-type ca2+ channels allows inhibit beta-adrenergic-induced inotropy neuronal synthase nos1 however targeted cardiac sr11 stimulation sr ca2+ release via ryanodine receptor ryr vitro suggests nos1 opposite facilitative effect contractility demonstrate nos1-deficient mice suppressed inotropic response whereas nos3-deficient mice enhanced contractility owing corresponding changes sr ca2+ release nos1-/- nos3-/- mice develop age-related hypertrophy although nos3-/- mice hypertensive nos1/-/- double knockout mice suppressed beta-adrenergic responses additive phenotype marked ventricular remodelling thus nos1 nos3 mediate independent cases opposite effects cardiac structure function
