plant diversity enhances ecosystem responses elevated co2 nitrogen deposition 
human actions causing declines plant biodiversity increases atmospheric co2 concentrations increases nitrogen deposition however interactive effects factors ecosystem processes unknown reduced biodiversity raised numerous concerns including possibility ecosystem functioning may affected negatively- might particularly important face global changes present results grassland field experiment minnesota usa tests hypothesis plant diversity composition influence enhancement biomass carbon acquisition ecosystems subjected elevated atmospheric co2 concentrations nitrogen deposition study experimentally controlled plant diversity species soil nitrogen unamended versus deposition g nitrogen per m per yr atmospheric co2 concentrations using free-air co2 enrichment ambient mu mol mol- versus elevated mu mol mol- found enhanced biomass accumulation response elevated levels co2 nitrogen combination less species-poor species-rich assemblages
