experience-dependent plasticity dendritic spines developing rat barrel cortex vivo
changes neuronal structure underlie cortical plasticity used time-lapse two-photon microscopy pyramidal neurons layer / developing rat barrel cortex image structural dynamics dendritic spines filopodia found protrusions highly motile: spines filopodia appeared disappeared changed shape tens minutes test whether sensory experience drives motility trimmed whiskers one three days imaging sensory deprivation markedly similar % reduced protrusive motility deprived regions barrel cortex critical period around postnatal days p- effect younger p8- older p14- animals unexpectedly whisker trimming change density length shape spines filopodia however sensory deprivation critical period degraded tuning layer / receptive fields thus sensory experience drives structural plasticity dendrites may underlie reorganization neural circuits
