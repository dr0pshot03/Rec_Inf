using hz gps data measure deformations caused denali fault earthquake
november moment magnitude denali fault earthquake generated large permanent surface displacements alaska large-amplitude surface waves throughout western north america find good agreement strong ground-motion records integrated displacement hertz global positioning system gps position estimates collected similar kilometers earthquake epicenter one-hertz gps receivers also detected seismic surface waves kilometers epicenter whereas waves saturated many seismic instruments region high-frequency gps increases dynamic range frequency bandwidth ground-motion observations providing another tool studying earthquake processes
