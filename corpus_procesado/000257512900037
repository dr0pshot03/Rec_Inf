anticrack nucleation triggering mechanism snow slab avalanches 
snow slab avalanches believed begin gravity driven shear failure weak layers stratified snow critical crack length shear crack propagation along layers increase without bound slope decreases however recent experiments show critical length artificially introduced cracks remains constant anything slightly decreases decreasing slope surprising observation can understood terms volumetric collapse weak layer failure resulting formation propagation mixed mode anticracks driven simultaneously slope parallel slope normal components gravity fractures may propagate even crack face friction impedes downhill sliding snowpack indicating scenario two separate conditions met slab avalanche release
