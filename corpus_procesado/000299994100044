hsp90 stress potentiates rapid cellular adaptation induction aneuploidy
aneuploidy-the state uneven numbers chromosomes-is hallmark cancer feature identified yeast diverse habitats- recent studies shown aneuploidy form large-effect mutation able confer adaptive phenotypes diverse stress conditions investigate whether pleiotropic stress induce aneuploidy budding yeast saccharomyces cerevisae show whereas diverse stress conditions can induce increase chromosome instability proteotoxic stress caused transient hsp90 also known hsp82 hsc82 inhibition heat shock markedly increased chromosome instability produce cell population high karyotype diversity induced chromosome instability linked evolutionarily conserved role hsp90 chaperone complex kinetochore assembly continued growth presence hsp90 inhibitor resulted emergence drug-resistant colonies chromosome xv gain drug-resistance phenotype quantitative trait involving copy number increases least two genes located chromosome xv shortterm exposure hsp90 stress potentiated fast adaptation unrelated cytotoxic compounds means different aneuploid chromosome stoichiometries findings demonstrate aneuploidy form stress-inducible mutation eukaryotes capable fuelling rapid phenotypic evolution drug resistance reveal new role hsp90 regulating emergence adaptive traits stress
