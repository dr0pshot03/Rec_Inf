conformational spread mechanism cooperativity bacterial flagellar switch 
bacterial flagellar switch controls direction flagellar rotation chemotaxis highly cooperative response previously understood terms classic two-state concerted model allosteric regulation used high-resolution optical microscopy observe switching single motors uncover stochastic multistate nature switch observations detailed quantitative agreement recent general model allosteric cooperativity exhibits conformational spread-the stochastic growth shrinkage domains adjacent subunits sharing particular conformational state expect conformational spread will important explaining cooperativity large signaling complexes
