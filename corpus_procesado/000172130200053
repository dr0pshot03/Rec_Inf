cns synaptogenesis promoted glia-derived cholesterol
molecular mechanisms controlling synaptogenesis central nervous system cns poorly understood previous reports showed glia-derived factor strongly promotes synapse development cultures purified cns neurons identify factor cholesterol complexed apolipoprotein e-containing lipoproteins cns neurons produce enough cholesterol survive grow formation numerous mature synapses demands additional amounts must provided glia thus availability cholesterol appears limit synapse development may explain delayed onset cns synaptogenesis glia differentiation neurobehavioral manifestations defects cholesterol lipoprotein homeostasis
