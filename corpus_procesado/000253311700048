rapid neural coding retina relative spike latencies 
natural vision highly dynamic process frequent body head eye movements constantly bring new images onto retina brief periods challenging understanding neural code vision report certain retinal ganglion cells encode spatial structure briefly presented image relative timing first spikes code found largely invariant stimulus contrast robust noisy fluctuations response latencies mechanistically observed response characteristics result different kinetics two retinal pathways "on" "off" converge onto ganglion cells mechanism allows retina rapidly reliably transmit new spatial information first spikes emitted neural population
