tunable delay einstein-podolsky-rosen entanglement
entangled systems display correlations stronger can obtained classically makes entanglement essential resource number applications quantum information processing quantum computing quantum communications ability control transfer entanglement different locations will play key role quantum protocols enable quantum networks transfer requires system can delay quantum correlations without significant degradation effectively acting short term quantum memory important benchmark systems ability delay einstein podolsky rosen epr levels entanglement able tune delay epr entanglement basis number quantum protocols allowing remote inference properties one system better standard quantum limit measurements correlated system show four wave mixing process based double lambda scheme hot rb vapour allows us obtain optically tunable delay epr entangled beams light significant maximum delay order width cross correlation function achieved four wave mixing also preserves quantum spatial correlations entangled beams take advantage property delay entangled images making first step towards quantum memory images
