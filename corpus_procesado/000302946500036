differential positioning adherens junctions associated initiation epithelial folding
tissue morphogenesis simple epithelial sheets undergo folding form complex structures prevailing model underlying epithelial folding involves cell shape changes driven myosin-dependent apical constriction describe alternative mechanism requires differential positioning adherens junctions controlled modulation epithelial apical-basal polarity using live embryo imaging show initiation dorsal transverse folds drosophila gastrulation adherens junctions shift basally initiating cells maintain original subapical positioning neighbouring cells junctional positioning dorsal epithelium depends polarity proteins bazooka par- particular basal shift occurs initiating cells associated progressive decrease par levels show uniform reduction activity bazooka par results uniform apical lateral positioning junctions case dorsal fold initiation abolished addition increase bazooka/par ratio causes formation ectopic dorsal folds basal shift junctions alters apical shape initiating cells also forces lateral membrane adjacent cells bend towards initiating cells thereby facilitating tissue deformation data thus establish direct link modification epithelial polarity initiation epithelial folding
