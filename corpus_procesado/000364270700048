rhodium-catalysed syn-carboamination alkenes via transient directing group
alkenes ubiquitous prochiral functional groups-those can converted achiral chiral single step accessible synthetic chemists reason difunctionalization reactions alkenes whereby two functional groups added double bond particularly important can used produce highly complex molecular architectures stereoselective oxidation reactions including dihydroxylation aminohydroxylation halogenation- well established methods functionalizing alkenes however intermolecular incorporation carbon nitrogen-based functionalities stereoselectively across alkene reported describe rhodium-catalysed carboamination alkenes syn face double bond initiated carbon-hydrogen activation event uses enoxyphthalimides source carbon nitrogen functionalities reaction methodology allows intermolecular stereospecific formation one carbon-carbon one carbon-nitrogen bond across alkene knowledge unprecedented reaction design involves situ generation bidentate directing group use new cyclopentadienyl ligand control reactivity rhodium results provide new way synthesizing functionalized alkenes lead convergent stereoselective assembly amine-containing acyclic molecules
