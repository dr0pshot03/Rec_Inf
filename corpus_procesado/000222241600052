layer-specific somatosensory cortical activation active tactile discrimination
ensemble neuronal activity recorded layer whisker area primary somatosensory cortex si rats performed whisker-dependent tactile discrimination task comparison activity si activity evoked similar passive whisker stimulation revealed fundamental differences tactile signal processing active passive stimulation moreover significant layer specific functional differences si activity observed active discrimination differences explained solely variations ascending thalamocortical input si instead results suggest top-down influences active discrimination may alter overall functional nature si well layer-specific mechanisms tactile processing
