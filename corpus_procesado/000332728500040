dlk1 promotes fast motor neuron biophysical signature required peak force execution 
motor neurons relay neural commands drive skeletal muscle movements encompass types ranging slow fast whose biophysical properties govern timing gradation amplitude muscle force identify noncanonical notch ligand delta-like homolog dlk1 determinant motor neuron functional diversification dlk1 expressed similar % motor neurons necessary sufficient promote fast biophysical signature mouse chick dlk1 suppresses notch signaling activates expression k+ channel subunit kcng4 modulate delayed-rectifier currents dlk1 inactivation comprehensively shifts motor neurons toward slow biophysical transcriptome signatures abolishing peak force outputs findings provide insights development motor neuron functional diversity contribution execution movements
