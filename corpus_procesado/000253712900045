high-resolution mapping crossovers reveals extensive variation fine-scale recombination patterns among humans 
recombination plays crucial role meiosis ensuring proper segregation chromosomes recent linkage disequilibrium ld sperm typing studies suggest recombination rates vary tremendously across human genome events occurring narrow hotspots examine variation fine scale recombination patterns among individuals used dense genome wide single nucleotide polymorphism data collected nuclear families localize crossovers high spatial resolution analysis revealed overall recombination hotspot usage similar males females individual hotspots often active sexes across genome roughly % crossovers occurred hotspots inferred ld studies notably however found extensive heritable variation among males females proportion crossovers occurring hotspots
