nanospring behaviour ankyrin repeats
ankyrin repeats amino-acid motif believed function protein recognition present tandem copies diverse proteins nearly phyla ankyrin repeats contain antiparallel alpha-helices can stack form superhelical spiral visual inspection extrapolated structure ankyrin-r repeats indicates possibility spring-like behaviour putative superhelix moreover stacks ankyrin repeats cytoplasmic domains transient receptor potential trp channels identified candidates spring gates mechanoreceptors hair cells well drosophila bristles- report tandem ankyrin repeats exhibit tertiary-structure-based elasticity behave linear fully reversible spring single-molecule measurements atomic force microscopy also observe unexpected ability unfolded repeats generate force refolding report first direct measurement refolding force protein domain thus show one common amino-acid motifs spring properties important mechanotransduction design nanodevices
