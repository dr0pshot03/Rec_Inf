optimal eye movement strategies visual search
performvisual search humans like many mammals encode large field view retinas variable spatial resolution use high-speed eye movements direct highest-resolution region fovea towards potential target locations good search performance essential survival hence mammals may evolved efficient strategies selecting fixation locations address two questions: optimal eye movement strategies foveated visual system faced problem finding target cluttered environment humans employ optimal eye movement strategies search derive ideal bayesian observer- search tasks target embedded unknown location within random background spectral characteristics natural scenes ideal searcher uses precise knowledge statistics scenes target embedded visual system make eye movements gain information target location find humans achieve nearly optimal search performance even though humans integrate information poorly across fixations- analysis ideal searcher reveals little benefit perfect integration across fixations much important efficient processing information fixation apparently evolution exploited fact achieve efficient eye movement strategies minimal neural resources devoted memory
