effects aneuploidy cellular physiology cell division haploid yeast 
aneuploidy condition frequently found tumor cells effect cellular physiology known characterized one aspect aneuploidy: gain extra chromosomes created collection haploid yeast strains bear extra copy one almost yeast chromosomes characterization revealed aneuploid strains share number phenotypes including defects cell cycle progression increased glucose uptake increased sensitivity conditions interfering protein synthesis protein folding phenotypes observed strains carrying additional yeast genes indicates reflect consequences additional protein production well resulting imbalances cellular protein composition conclude aneuploidy causes proliferative disadvantage also set phenotypes independent identity individual extra chromosomes
