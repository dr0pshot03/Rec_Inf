vacancies solids stability surface morphology 
determining thermal vacancies created destroyed solids crucial understanding many physical properties solid-state diffusion surfaces known good sources sinks bulk vacancies directly determining exchange surface bulk occurs difficult show vacancy generation annihilation surface ordered nickel-aluminium intermetallic alloy occur entire surface near atomic step edges determined oscillating samples temperature observing real time response surface structure function frequency version angstroms method measuring thermal conductivity using low-energy electron microscopy although surface-exchange process slow compared bulk diffusion vacancy-generation rate nevertheless controls dynamics alloy surface morphology observations demonstrating surface smoothing can occur bulk vacancy transport rather surface diffusion important implications stability fabricated nanoscale structures
