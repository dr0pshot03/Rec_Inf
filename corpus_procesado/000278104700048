mtorc1-mediated cell proliferation cell growth controlled 4e-bps
mammalian target rapamycin complex mtorc1 integrates mitogen nutrient signals control cell proliferation cell size hence mtorc1 implicated large number human diseases-including diabetes obesity heart disease cancer-that characterized aberrant cell growth proliferation although eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4e-binding proteins 4e-bps critical mediators mtorc1 function precise contribution mtorc1 signaling mechanisms mediate mtorc1 function remained unclear inhibited mtorc1 pathway cells lacking 4e-bps analyzed effects cell size cell proliferation cell cycle progression although 4e-bps effect cell size inhibited cell proliferation selectively inhibiting translation messenger rnas encode proliferation-promoting proteins proteins involved cell cycle progression thus control cell size cell cycle progression appear independent mammalian cells whereas lower eukaryotes 4e-bps influence cell growth proliferation
