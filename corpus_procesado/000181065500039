proteomic screen finds pser/pthr-binding domain localizing plk1 mitotic substrates
developed proteomic approach identifying phosphopeptide binding domains modulate kinase-dependent signaling pathways immobilized library partially degenerate phosphopeptides biased toward particular protein kinase phosphorylation motif used isolate phospho-binding domains bind proteins phosphorylated kinase applying approach cyclin-dependent kinases cdks identified polo-box domain pbd mitotic kinase polo-like kinase plk1 specific phosphoserine pser phosphothreonine pthr binding domain determined optimal binding motif motif present known plk1 substrates cdc25 optimal phosphopeptide containing motif disrupted pbd-substrate binding localization pbd centrosomes finding reveals plk1 can localize specific sites within cells response cdk phosphorylation sites provides structural mechanism targeting plk1 kinase domain substrates
