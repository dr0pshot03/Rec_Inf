interleukin beta-mediated induction cox cns contributes inflammatory pain hypersensitivity 
inflammation causes induction cyclooxygenase cox- leading release prostanoids sensitize peripheral nociceptor terminals produce localized pain hypersensitivity peripheral inflammation also generates pain hypersensitivity neighbouring uninjured tissue secondary hyperalgesia increased neuronal excitability spinal cord central sensitization syndrome comprising diffuse muscle joint pain fever lethargy anorexia show cox may involved central nervous system cns responses finding widespread induction cox expression spinal cord neurons regions cns elevating prostaglandin e pge levels cerebrospinal fluid major inducer central cox upregulation interleukin beta cns basal phospholipase activity cns change peripheral inflammation cox levels must regulate central prostanoid production intraspinal administration interleukin-converting enzyme cox inhibitor decreases inflammation-induced central pge levels mechanical hyperalgesia thus preventing central prostanoid production inhibiting interleukin beta mediated induction cox neurons inhibiting central cox activity reduces centrally generated inflammatory pain hypersensitivity
