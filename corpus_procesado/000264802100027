bent hawaiian-emperor hotspot track: inheriting mantle wind
bends volcanic hotspot lineaments best represented large elbow hawaiian-emperor chain thought directly record changes plate motion several lines geophysical inquiry now suggest change locus upwelling mantle induced mantle dynamics causes bends hotspot tracks inverse modeling suggests although deep flow near core-mantle boundary may played role hawaiian-emperor bend capture plume ridge followed changes sub-pacific mantle flow can better explain observations thus hotspot tracks can reveal patterns past mantle circulation
