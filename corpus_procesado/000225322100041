direct observation discrete character intrinsic localized modes antiferromagnet 
strongly nonlinear discrete system spatial size excitation can become comparable influenced lattice spacing intrinsic localized modes ilms-also called discrete breathers lattice solitons-are responsible energy localization dynamics discrete nonlinear lattices1- energy profiles resemble localized modes defects harmonic lattice like solitons can move although unlike solitons energy exchanged collisions manipulation localized energy hotspots achieved systems diverse annular arrays coupled josephson junctions67 optical waveguide arrays8 two-dimensional nonlinear photonic crystals9 micromechanical cantilever arrays10 also evidence existence localized excitations atomic lattices11- although individual ilms yet identified report observation countable localized excitations antiferromagnetic spin lattice means nonlinear spectroscopic technique detection capability permits properties individual ilms probed; disappearance ilm registers step time-dependent signal surprising result energy staircase ilm excitations uniquely defined
