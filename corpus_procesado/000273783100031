measurement universal thermodynamic functions unitary fermi gas 
thermodynamic properties matter generally depend details interactions constituent parts however unitary fermi gas scattering length diverges thermodynamics determined universal functions depend particle density temperature using general form equation state equation force balance measured local internal energy trapped gas function parameters universal functions corresponding helmholtz free energy chemical potential entropy calculated general thermodynamic relations critical parameters also determined superfluid transition temperature results apply strongly interacting fermionic systems including neutron stars nuclear matter
