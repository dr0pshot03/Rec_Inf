molecular mechanisms functionality lubricant additives
wear limits life-span many mechanical devices moving parts reduce wear lubricants frequently enriched additives zinc phosphates form protective films rubbing surfaces using first-principles molecular dynamics simulations films derived commercial additives unraveled molecular origin antiwear films can form function dissipate energy effects originate pressure-induced changes coordination number atoms acting cross-linking agents form chemically connected networks proposed mechanism explains diverse body experiments promises prove useful rational design antiwear additives operate wider range surface materials reduced environmental side effects
