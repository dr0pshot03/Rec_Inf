phosphorylation h2a bub1 prevents chromosomal instability localizing shugoshin 
bub1 multi-task protein kinase required proper chromosome segregation eukaryotes impairment bub1 humans may lead chromosomal instability cin tumorigenesis yet primary cellular substrate bub1 remained elusive show bub1 phosphorylates conserved serine histone h2a fission yeast schizosaccharomyces pombe h2a-sa mutant cellular h2a-s121 replaced alanine phenocopies bub1 kinase-dead mutant bub1-kd losing centromeric localization shugoshin proteins artificial tethering shugoshin centromeres largely restores h2a-sa bub1-kd-related cin defects function evolutionally conserved thus bub1 kinase creates mark shugoshin localization correct partitioning chromosomes
