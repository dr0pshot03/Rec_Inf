defining stem cell dynamics models intestinal tumor initiation
cancer disease cells accumulate genetic aberrations believed confer clonal advantage cells surrounding tissue however quantitative benefit frequently occurring mutations tumor development remains unknown quantified competitive advantage apc loss kras activation p53 mutations mouse intestine findings indicate fate conferred mutations deterministic many mutated stem cells replaced wild-type stem cells biased still stochastic events furthermore p53 mutations display condition-dependent advantage especially colitis-affected intestines clones harboring mutations gene favored work confirms previously theoretical notion tissue architecture intestine suppresses accumulation mutated lineages
