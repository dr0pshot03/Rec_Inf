odour-plume dynamics influence brains olfactory code
neural computations used represent olfactory information brain long investigated- recent studies insect antennal lobe suggest precise temporal and/or spatial patterns activity underlie recognition discrimination different odours- patterns may strengthened associative learning remains unknown however whether activity patterns persist odour intensity varies rapidly unpredictably often occurs nature show naturally intermittent odour stimulation spike patterns recorded moth antennal-lobe output neurons varied predictably fine-scale temporal dynamics intensity odour data support hypothesis olfactory circuits compensate contextual variations stimulus pattern high temporal precision timing output neuron activity constantly modulated reflect ongoing changes stimulus intensity dynamics occur millisecond timescale
