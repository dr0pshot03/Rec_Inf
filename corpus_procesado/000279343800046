male mouse pheromone esp1 enhances female sexual receptive behaviour specific vomeronasal receptor 
various social behaviours mice regulated chemical signals called pheromones act vomeronasal system1- exocrine gland-secreting peptide esp1 -kda peptide released intomale tear fluids stimulates vomeronasal sensory neurons female mice4 describe molecular neural mechanisms involved decoding esp1 signals vomeronasal system leads behavioural output female mice esp1 recognized specific vomeronasal receptor v2rp5 ligand-receptor interaction results sex-specific signal transmission amygdaloid hypothalamic nuclei via accessory olfactory bulb consequently esp1 enhances female sexual receptive behaviour upon male mounting lordosis allowing successful copulation v2rp5-deficient mice esp1 induces neither neural activation sexual behaviour findings show esp1 crucial male pheromone regulates female reproductive behaviour specific receptor mouse vomeronasal system
