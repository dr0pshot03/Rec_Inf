discovery organic trefoil knot
molecular knots remain difficult produce using current synthetic methods chemistry topological complexity report near-quantitative self-assembly trefoil knot naphthalenediimide-based aqueous disulfide dynamic combinatorial library formation knot appears driven hydrophobic effect leads structure aromatic components buried hydrophilic carboxylate groups remain exposed solvent moreover building block chirality constrains topological conformation knot results stereoselective synthesis work demonstrates hydrophobic effect provides powerful strategy direct synthesis entwined architectures
