new madrid seismic zone: dead yet
extent ongoing seismicity intraplate regions represents long-lived aftershock activity unclear examined historical instrumental seismicity new madrid central u s region determine whether present-day seismicity composed predominantly aftershocks earthquake sequence high aftershock productivity required match observation multiple mainshocks explain modern level activity aftershocks synthetic sequences consistent observations substantially overpredict number events magnitude > observed past years results imply ongoing background seismicity new madrid region driven ongoing strain accrual processes despite low deformation rates seismic activity zone decaying time
