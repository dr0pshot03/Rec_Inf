regulation brassinosteroid signaling gsk3/shaggy-like kinase 
gsk3/shaggy highly conserved serine/threonine kinase implicated many signaling pathways eukaryotes although many gsk3/shaggy-like kinases identified plants little known functions plant growth development show arabidopsis brassinosteroid-insensitive bin2 gene encodes gsk3/shaggy-like kinase gain-of-function mutations within coding sequence overexpression inhibit brassinosteroid br signaling resulting plants resemble br-deficient br-response mutants contrast reduced bin2 expression via cosuppression partially rescues weak br-signaling mutation thus bin2 acts negative regulator control steroid signaling plants
