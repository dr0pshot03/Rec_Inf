attention deficits without cortical neuronal deficits
ability process relevant stimuli selectively fundamental function primate visual system best-understood correlate function enhanced response neurons visual cortex attended stimuli however recent results show superior colliculus sc midbrain structure also crucial role visual attention- assumed sc acts well-known mechanisms visual cortex tested hypothesis transiently inactivating sc motion-change-detection task measuring responses two visual cortical areas found despite large deficits visual attention enhanced responses neurons visual cortex attended stimuli unchanged results show sc contributes visual attention mechanisms independent classic effects visual cortex demonstrating processes must key roles visual attention
