co2 capture humid flue gases humid atmosphere using microporous coppersilicate
capturing co2 humid flue gases atmosphere porous materials remains costly prior dehydration gases required large number microporous materials physical adsorption capacity developed co2-capturing materials however suffer co2 sorption capacity reduction structure decomposition caused co-adsorbed h2o exposed humid flue gases atmosphere report highly stable microporous coppersilicate h2o-specific co2-specific adsorption sites h2o/co2-sharing sites therefore readily adsorbs h2o co2 humid flue gases atmosphere adsorbing h2o interfere adsorption co2 also highly stable adsorption h2o co2 synthesized hydrothermally
