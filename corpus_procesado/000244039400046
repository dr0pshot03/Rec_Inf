senescence tumour clearance triggered p53 restoration murine liver carcinomas 
although cancer arises combination mutations oncogenes tumour suppressor genes extent tumour suppressor gene loss required maintaining established tumours poorly understood p53 important tumour suppressor acts restrict proliferation response dna damage deregulation mitogenic oncogenes leading induction various cell cycle checkpoints apoptosis cellular senescence consequently p53 mutations increase cell proliferation survival settings promote genomic instability resistance certain chemotherapies determine consequences reactivating p53 pathway tumours used rna interference rnai conditionally regulate endogenous p53 expression mosaic mouse model liver carcinoma show even brief reactivation endogenous p53 p53-deficient tumours can produce complete tumour regressions primary response p53 apoptosis instead involved induction cellular senescence program associated differentiation upregulation inflammatory cytokines program although producing cell cycle arrest vitro also triggered innate immune response targeted tumour cells vivo thereby contributing tumour clearance study indicates p53 loss can required maintenance aggressive carcinomas illustrates cellular senescence program can act together innate immune system potently limit tumour growth
