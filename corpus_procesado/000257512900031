identifying autism loci genes tracing recent shared ancestry 
find inherited causes autism spectrum disorders studied families parents share ancestors enhancing role inherited factors mapped several loci containing large inherited homozygous deletions likely mutations largest deletions implicated genes including pcdh10 protocadherin dia1 deleted autism1 c3orf58 whose level expression changes response neuronal activity marker genes involved synaptic changes underlie learning subset genes including nhe9 na+/h+ exchanger showed additional potential mutations patients unrelated parents findings highlight utility homozygosity mapping heterogeneous disorders like autism also suggest defective regulation gene expression neural activity may mechanism common seemingly diverse autism mutations
