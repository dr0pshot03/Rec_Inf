recent earth oblateness variations: unraveling climate postglacial rebound effects 
earths dynamic oblateness j2 decreasing due postglacial rebound pgr however j2 began increase indicating pronounced global-scale mass redistribution within earths system determined observed increases j2 caused primarily recent surge subpolar glacial melting mass shifts southern pacific indian oceans effects removed residual trend j2 - x - year- becomes consistent previous estimates pgr satellite eclipse data climatic significance rapid shifts glacial oceanic mass however remains investigated
