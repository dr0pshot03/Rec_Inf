bacterial tyrosine phosphatase inhibits plant pattern recognition receptor activation
innate immunity relies perception pathogen-associated molecular patterns pamps pattern-recognition receptors prrs located host cells surface many plant prrs kinases report arabidopsis receptor kinase ef-tu receptor efr perceives elf18 peptide derived bacterial elongation factor tu activated upon ligand binding phosphorylation tyrosine residues phosphorylation single tyrosine residue y836 required activation efr downstream immunity phytopathogenic bacterium pseudomonas syringae tyrosine phosphatase hopao1 secreted p syringae reduces efr phosphorylation prevents subsequent immune responses thus host pathogen compete take control prr tyrosine phosphorylation used initiate antibacterial immunity
