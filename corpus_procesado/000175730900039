netrin--mediated axon outgrowth requires deleted colorectal cancer-dependent mapk activation 
neuronal growth cones guided targets attractive repulsive guidance cues mammals netrin bifunctional cue attracting axons repelling others- deleted colorectal cancer dcc receptor netrin mediates chemoattractive effect commissural axons signalling mechanisms transduce effect poorly understood show dcc activates mitogen-activated protein kinase mapk signalling means extracellular signal-regulated kinase erk netrin binding transfected cells commissural neurons activation associated recruitment erk-/ dcc receptor complex inhibition erk-/ antagonizes netrin-dependent axon outgrowth orientation thus activation mapk signalling dcc contributes netrin signalling axon growth guidance
