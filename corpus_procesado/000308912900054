disruption reconsolidation erases fear memory trace human amygdala 
memories become labile recalled humans rodents alike reactivated fear memories can attenuated disrupting reconsolidation extinction training using functional brain imaging found conditioned fear memory formed reactivation reconsolidation left memory trace basolateral amygdala predicted subsequent fear expression tightly coupled activity fear circuit brain contrast reactivation followed disrupted reconsolidation suppressed fear abolished memory trace attenuated fear-circuit connectivity thus previously demonstrated rodents fear memory suppression resulting behavioral disruption reconsolidation amygdala-dependent also humans supports evolutionarily conserved memory-update mechanism
