implications limiting co2 concentrations land use energy
limiting atmospheric carbon dioxide co2 concentrations low levels requires strategies manage anthropogenic carbon emissions terrestrial systems well fossil fuel industrial sources explore implications fully integrating terrestrial systems energy system comprehensive mitigation regime limits atmospheric co2 concentrations find comprehensive approach lowers cost meeting environmental goals also carries profound implications agriculture: unmanaged ecosystems forests expand food crop livestock prices rise finally find future improvement food crop productivity directly affects land-use change emissions making technology growing crops potentially important limiting atmospheric co2 concentrations
