cleavage scarecrow-like mrna targets directed class arabidopsis mirna 
micro-rnas mirnas regulatory molecules mediate effects interacting messenger rna mrna targets show arabidopsis thaliana mirna also known mir171 -ribonucleotide species accumulates predominantly inflorescence tissues produced intergenic region chromosome iii functionally interacts mrna targets encoding several members scarecrow-like scl family putative transcription factors mirna complementary internal region three scl mrnas interaction results specific cleavage target mrna within region complementarity indicating class mirna functions like small interfering rna associated rna silencing guide sequence-specific cleavage developmentally controlled manner
