transcriptional coactivator pgc-1a integrates mammalian clock energy metabolism 
mammalian clock regulates major aspects energy metabolism including glucose lipid homeostasis mitochondrial oxidative metabolism biochemical basis coordinated control circadian clock diverse metabolic pathways well understood show pgc alpha ppargc1a transcriptional coactivator regulates energy metabolism- rhythmically expressed liver skeletal muscle mice pgc alpha stimulates expression clock genes notably bmal1 arntl rev-erba nr1d1 coactivation ror family orphan nuclear receptors mice lacking pgc alpha show abnormal diurnal rhythms activity body temperature metabolic rate disruption physiological rhythms animals correlated aberrant expression clock genes involved energy metabolism analyses pgc alpha-deficient fibroblasts mice liver-specific knockdown pgc alpha indicate required cell-autonomous clock function thus identified pgc alpha key component circadian oscillator integrates mammalian clock energy metabolism
