chiral sign induction vortices formation mesophases stirred solutions
achiral diprotonated porphyrins forming homoassociates aqueous solution lead spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking unexpected result chirality sign homoassociates can selected vortex motion aggregation process result confirmed means circular dichroism spectra experimental findings rationalized terms asymmetric influence macroscopic forces bifurcation scenarios considering specific binding characteristics porphyrin units form homoassociates
