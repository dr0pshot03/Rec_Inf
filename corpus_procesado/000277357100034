nanoscale three-dimensional patterning molecular resists scanning probes 
patterning organic resists optical electron beam lithography established methods; however resolutions nanometers inherent problems result unwanted exposure resist nearby areas present scanning probe lithography method based local desorption glassy organic resist heatable probe demonstrate patterning half pitch nanometers without proximity corrections throughputs approaching gaussian electron beam lithography similar resolution patterns can transferred substrates material can removed successive steps order fabricate complex three-dimensional structures
