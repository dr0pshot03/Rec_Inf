protein lem promotes cd8+ t cell immunity effects mitochondrial respiration 
protective cd8+ t cell-mediated immunity requires massive expansion cell number development long-lived memory cells using forward genetics mice identified orphan protein named lymphocyte expansion molecule lem promoted antigen-dependent cd8+ t cell proliferation effector function memory cell generation response infection lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus generation lem-deficient mice confirmed results interaction cr6 interacting factor crif1 lem controlled levels oxidative phosphorylation oxphos complexes respiration resulting production pro-proliferative mitochondrial reactive oxygen species mros lem provides link immune activation expansion protective cd8+ t cells driven oxphos represents pathway restoration long-term protective immunity based metabolically modified cytotoxic cd8+ t cells
