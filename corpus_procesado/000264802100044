widespread changes synaptic markers function sleep wakefulness drosophila 
sleep universal strictly regulated necessary cognition remains mystery although recent work suggests sleep memory plasticity linked however little known wakefulness sleep affect synapses using western blots confocal microscopy drosophila found protein levels key components central synapses high waking low sleep changes related behavioral state rather time day occurred major areas drosophila brain decrease synaptic markers sleep progressive sleep necessary decline thus sleep may involved maintaining synaptic homeostasis altered waking activities
