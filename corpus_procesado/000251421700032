evidence alfven waves solar x-ray jets 
coronal magnetic fields dynamic field lines may misalign reassemble release energy means magnetic reconnection giant releases may generate solar flares coronal mass ejections smaller scale produce x-ray jets hinode observations polar coronal holes reveal x-ray jets two distinct velocities: one near alfven speed similar kilometers per second another near sound speed kilometers per second many jets seen reported previously detected average events per hour speeds whereas previous observations documented handful per day lower average speeds kilometers per second x-ray jets x x kilometers wide x kilometers long last seconds large number events coupled high velocities apparent outflows indicates jets may contribute high-speed solar wind
