anaerobic microbial metabolism can proceed close thermodynamic limits
many fermentative bacteria obtain energy growth reactions change free energy deltag less needed synthesize atp- bacteria couple substrate metabolism directly atp synthesis however classical phosphoryl transfer reactions explanation energy economy organisms biological systems conserve energy discrete amounts minimum biochemically convertible energy value kj mol- refs- concept predicts anaerobic substrate decay ceases minimum free energy value reached several studies support prediction- show metabolism syntrophic associations degradation substrate one species thermodynamically possible removal end product another species can occur values close thermodynamic equilibrium deltag approximate to0 kj mol- free energy remaining substrate metabolism halts constant depends terminal electron-accepting reaction amount energy required substrate activation syntrophic associations metabolize near thermodynamic equilibrium indicating bacteria operate extremely efficient catabolic systems
