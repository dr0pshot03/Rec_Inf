periodic emission gamma-ray binary 1fgl j1018-
gamma-ray binaries stellar systems containing neutron star black hole gamma-ray emission produced interaction components systems rare even though binary evolution models predict dozens galaxy search gamma-ray binaries fermi large area telescope lat shows 1fgl j1018 exhibits intensity spectral modulation -day period identified variable x-ray counterpart shows sharp maximum coinciding maximum gamma-ray emission well o6vf star optical counterpart radio counterpart also apparently modulated orbital period 1fgl j1018 thus gamma-ray binary detection suggests presence fainter binaries galaxy
