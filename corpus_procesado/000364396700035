oxidative stress inhibits distant metastasis human melanoma cells
solid cancer cells commonly enter blood disseminate systemically highly inefficient forming distant metastases poorly understood reasons studied human melanomas differed metastasis histories patients capacity metastasize nod-scid-il2rg-/- nsg mice show melanomas high frequencies cells formed subcutaneous tumours much lower percentages cells formed tumours intravenous intrasplenic transplantation particularly among inefficiently metastasizing melanomas melanoma cells blood visceral organs experienced oxidative stress observed established subcutaneous tumours successfully metastasizing melanomas underwent reversible metabolic changes metastasis increased capacity withstand oxidative stress including increased dependence nadph-generating enzymes folate pathway antioxidants promoted distant metastasis nsg mice folate pathway inhibition using low-dose methotrexate aldh1l2 knockdown mthfd1 knockdown inhibited distant metastasis without significantly affecting growth subcutaneous tumours mice oxidative stress thus limits distant metastasis melanoma cells vivo
