using selective withdrawal coat microparticles 
report method uses process selective withdrawal one fluid second immiscible fluid coat small particles polymer films fluid withdrawn tube orifice slightly water-oil interface upon increasing flow rate transition state oil withdrawn state water containing particles coated appropriate prepolymer reagents entrained thin spout along oil entrained particles eventually cause spout interface break producing thin coat controllable thickness around particle can subsequently polymerized using chemical reagents light heat method allows flexibility chemical composition thickness conformal coatings
