glycogen synthase kinase mll leukaemia maintenance targeted therapy
glycogen synthase kinase gsk3 multifunctional serine/ threonine kinase participates numerous signalling pathways involved diverse physiological processes several pathways implicated disease pathogenesis prompted efforts develop gsk3 specific inhibitors therapeutic applications however now strong rationale targeting gsk3 malignancies report pharmacological physiological genetic studies demonstrate oncogenic requirement gsk3 maintenance specific subtype poor prognosis human leukaemia genetically defined mutations mll proto oncogene contrast previously characterized roles suppression neoplasia associated signalling pathways gsk3 paradoxically supports mll leukaemia cell proliferation transformation mechanism ultimately involves destabilization cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor p27kip1 inhibition gsk3 preclinical murine model mll leukaemia provides promising evidence efficacy earmarks gsk3 candidate cancer drug target
