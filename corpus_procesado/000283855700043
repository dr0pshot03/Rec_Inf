intestinal stem cell replacement follows pattern neutral drift 
capacity rapid self-renewal regeneration intestinal epithelium stereotypical stem cell-supported tissues yet pattern stem cell turnover remains question applying analytical methods population dynamics statistical physics inducible genetic labeling system showed clone size distributions conform distinctive scaling behavior short times result demonstrates intestinal stem cells form equipotent population loss stem cell compensated multiplication neighbor leading neutral drift dynamics clones expand contract random either take crypt lost combined long-term clonal fate data show rate stem cell replacement comparable cell division rate implying neutral drift symmetrical cell divisions central stem cell homeostasis
