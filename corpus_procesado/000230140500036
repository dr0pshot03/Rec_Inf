heavy elements atomic number > produced rapid r-process nucleosynthesis lighter elements bombarded massive flux neutrons- although characteristic supernovae neutron star mergers uncertainties r-process occurs persist stellar models crude allow precise quantification phenomenon result many uncertainties assumptions models used calculate production ratios actinides like uranium thorium- current estimates u/th production ratio range similar show u/th abundance ratio meteorites can used conjunction observations low-metallicity stars halo milky way- determine u/th production ratio precisely -+ value can used future studies constrain possible nuclear mass formulae used r process calculations help determine source galactic cosmic rays date circumstellar grains also estimate age milky way -+ gyr way independent uncertainties associated fluctuations microwave background models stellar evolution
