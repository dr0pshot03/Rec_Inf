plasmodium protein network diverges eukaryotes 
plasmodium falciparum pathogen responsible % human deaths malaria therefore focus considerable research initiative involving complete dna sequencing genome large-scale expression analyses protein characterization life-cycle stages plasmodium genome sequence relatively distant eukaryotes % encoded proteins lacking notable sequence similarity organisms systematically elucidate functional relationships among proteins large two-hybrid study recently mapped network interactions involving proteins within plasmodium6 network adds growing collection available interaction maps number different organisms raises questions whether divergence plasmodium sequence level reflected configuration protein network examine degree conservation plasmodium protein network model organisms although find highly connected protein complexes specific network pathogen find little conservation complexes observed organisms three yeast none others overall patterns protein interaction plasmodium like genome sequence set apart species
