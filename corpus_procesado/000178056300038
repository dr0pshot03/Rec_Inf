structure sec23/-sar1 pre-budding complex copii vesicle coat 
copii-coated vesicles form endoplasmic reticulum stepwise recruitment three cytosolic components: sar1-gtp initiate coat formation sec23/ heterodimer select snare cargo molecules sec13/ induce coat polymerization membrane deformation crystallographic analysis saccharomyces cerevisiae sec23/-sar1 complex reveals bow-tie-shaped structure nm long membrane-proximal surface concave positively charged conform size acidic-phospholipid composition copii vesicle sec23 sar1 form continuous surface stabilized non-hydrolysable gtp analogue sar1 rearranged gdp conformation expose amino-terminal residues will probably embed bilayer gtpase-activating protein gap activity sec23 involves arginine side chain inserted sar1 active site observations establish structural basis gtp-dependent recruitment vesicular coat complex uncoating coat-controlled gtp hydrolysis
