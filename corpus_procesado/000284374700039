glacial silicic acid concentrations southern ocean 
reconstruction nutrient concentrations deep southern ocean produced conflicting results cadmium/calcium cd/ca data set suggests little change nutrient concentrations last glacial period whereas carbon isotope data set suggests nutrient concentrations higher determined silicon isotope composition sponge spicules atlantic pacific sectors southern ocean found higher silicic acid concentrations pacific sector last glacial period propose increase results changes stoichiometric uptake silicic acid relative nitrate phosphate diatoms thus facilitating redistribution nutrients across pacific southern oceans results consistent global cd/ca data set support silicic acid leakage hypothesis
