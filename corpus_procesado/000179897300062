rna processing exosome linked elongating rna polymerase ii drosophila 
rna polymerase ii elongation complex contains several factors facilitate transcription elongation catalyse processing precursor messenger rnas pre-mrnas- conserved elongation factor spt6 recruited rapidly robustly sites active transcription show drosophila spt6 dspt6 co-purifies exosome complex exoribonucleases implicated processing structural rna degradation improperly processed pre-mrna- immunoprecipitation assays drosophila nuclear extracts show exosome also associates elongation factor dspt5 rna polymerase ii vivo exosome subunits colocalize dspt6 transcriptionally active loci polytene chromosomes normal development strongly recruited heat-shock loci gene induction higher resolution chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis shows exosome recruited transcriptionally active units heat-shock genes data provide physical basis hypothesis exosome-mediated pre-mrna surveillance accompanies transcription elongation
