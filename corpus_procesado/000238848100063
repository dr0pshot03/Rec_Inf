ant odometer: stepping stilts stumps
desert ants catoglyphis navigate vast desert habitat path integration continuously integrate directions steered determined celestial compass distances traveled gauged as-yet-unknown mechanisms test hypothesis navigating ants measure distances traveled using kind step integrator step counter manipulated lengths legs hence stride lengths freely walking ants animals elongated stilts shortened legs stumps take larger shorter strides respectively concomitantly misgauge travel distance travel distance overestimated experimental animals walking stilts underestimated animals walking stumps
