kruppel-like factor regulates thymocyte t-cell migration 
mammalian kruppel-like transcription factors implicated regulating terminal differentiation several tissue types1- deficiency kruppel-like factor klf also known lklf leads massive loss peripheral t-cell pool4 suggesting klf2 regulates t-cell quiescence survival4- show however klf2 essential t-cell trafficking klf2-deficient klf2-/- thymocytes show impaired expression several receptors required thymocyte emigration peripheral trafficking including sphingosine--phosphate s1p receptor s1p1 cd62l beta7 integrin furthermore klf2 binds transactivates promoter s1p1 receptor critical thymocyte egress recirculation peripheral lymphoid organs findings suggest klf2 serves license mature t cells trafficking thymus recirculation secondary lymphoid tissues
