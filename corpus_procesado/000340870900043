generation compartmentalized pressure nuclear piston governs cell motility 3d matrix
cells use actomyosin contractility move three-dimensional 3d extracellular matrices contractility affects type protrusions cells use migrate 3d mechanisms unclear work found contractility generated high-pressure lobopodial protrusions human cells migrating 3d matrix cells nucleus physically divided cytoplasm forward rear compartments actomyosin contractility nucleoskeleton-intermediate filament linker protein nesprin pulled nucleus forward pressurized front cell reducing expression nesprin decreased equalized intracellular pressure thus nucleus can act piston physically compartmentalizes cytoplasm increases hydrostatic pressure nucleus leading edge cell drive lamellipodia-independent 3d cell migration
