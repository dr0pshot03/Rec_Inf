genetic properties influencing evolvability gene expression 
identifying properties gene networks influence evolution fundamental research goal however modes evolution inferred solely distribution natural variation selection interacts demography mutation rates shape polymorphism divergence estimated effects naturally occurring mutations gene expression minimizing effect natural selection demonstrate sensitivity gene expression mutations increases increasing trans-mutational target size presence tata box genes greater sensitivity mutations also sensitive systematic environmental perturbations stochastic noise results provide mechanistic basis gene expression evolvability can serve foundation realistic models regulatory evolution
