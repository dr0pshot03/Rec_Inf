oort cloud comets currently believed formed suns protoplanetary disk ejected large heliocentric orbits giant planets detailed models process fail reproduce available observational constraints however particular oort cloud appears substantially populous models predict present numerical simulations show sun captured comets stars birth cluster results imply substantial fraction oort cloud comets perhaps exceeding % protoplanetary disks stars
