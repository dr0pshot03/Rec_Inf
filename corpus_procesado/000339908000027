replaying evolutionary transitions dental fossil record 
evolutionary relationships extinct species ascertained primarily analysis morphological characters character inter-dependencies can substantial effect evolutionary interpretations developmental underpinnings character inter-dependence remain obscure experiments frequently provide detailed resolution morphological characters show experimentally computationally gradual modification development differentially affects characters mouse dentition found intermediate phenotypes produced gradually adding ectodysplas eda protein culture tooth explants carrying null mutation tooth-patterning gene eda identifying development-based character inter-dependencies show predict morphological patterns teeth among mammalian species finally vivo inhibition sonic hedgehog signalling eda null teeth enabled us reproduce characters deep rodent ancestry taken together evolutionarily informative transitions can experimentally reproduced thereby providing development-based expectations character-state transitions used evolutionary studies
