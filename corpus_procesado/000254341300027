proline-catalysed mannich reactions acetaldehyde 
small organic molecules recently emerged third class broadly useful asymmetric catalysts direct reactions yield predominantly one chiral product complementing enzymes metal complexes1 instance amino acid proline derivatives useful catalytic activation carbonyl compounds via nucleophilic enamine intermediates several important carbon carbon bond forming reactions including mannich reaction developed using approach2 useful making chiral biologically relevant compounds remarkably despite attempts34 simplest nucleophiles acetaldehyde used way show acetaldehyde powerful nucleophile asymmetric proline catalysed mannich reactions n tert butoxycarbonyl n boc imines yielding beta amino aldehydes extremely high enantioselectivities desirable products drug intermediates synthesis biologically active molecules although acetaldehyde used nucleophile reactions biological catalysts aldolases5 thiamine dependent enzymes6 also employed indirectly7- use inexpensive versatile two carbon nucleophile asymmetric small molecule catalysis will find many practical applications
