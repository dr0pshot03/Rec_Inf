proline-catalysed mannich reactions acetaldehyde 
small organic molecules recently emerged third class broadly useful asymmetric catalysts direct reactions yield predominantly one chiral product complementing enzymes metal complexes instance amino acid proline derivatives useful catalytic activation carbonyl compounds via nucleophilic enamine intermediates several important carbon carbon bond forming reactions including mannich reaction developed using approach useful making chiral biologically relevant compounds remarkably despite attempts simplest nucleophiles acetaldehyde used way show acetaldehyde powerful nucleophile asymmetric proline catalysed mannich reactions n tert butoxycarbonyl n boc imines yielding beta amino aldehydes extremely high enantioselectivities desirable products drug intermediates synthesis biologically active molecules although acetaldehyde used nucleophile reactions biological catalysts aldolases thiamine dependent enzymes also employed indirectly- use inexpensive versatile two carbon nucleophile asymmetric small molecule catalysis will find many practical applications
