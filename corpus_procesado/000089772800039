efficient delivery meteorites earth wide range asteroid parent bodies 
almost meteorites come asteroids identifying specific parent bodies modelling transport earth proved difficult usual model delivery orbital resonances major planets recently shown- deplete supply meteorites much rapidly explain either observed flux earth length time meteorites spent space measured cosmic-ray exposure ages independently found force arising anisotropically emitted thermal radiation asteroidal fragments yarkovsky effect influences fragments orbits important ways- report results detailed model transport meteorites earth includes yarkovsky effect collisional evolution asteroidal fragments rnd yarkovsky effect significantly increases efficiency delivery meteorites earth time allowing much wider range asteroids contribute flux meteorites model also reproduces observed distribution cosmic-ray exposure ages stony meteorites
