high-speed graphene transistors self-aligned nanowire gate
graphene attracted considerable interest potential new electronic material- high carrier mobility graphene particular interest ultrahigh-speed radio-frequency electronics- however conventional device fabrication processes readily applied produce high-speed graphene transistors often introduce significant defects monolayer carbon lattices severely degrade device performance- report approach fabrication high-speed graphene transistors self-aligned nanowire gate prevent degradation cosi-alo core-shell nanowire used gate source drain electrodes defined self-alignment process channel length defined nanowire diameter physical assembly nanowire gate preserves high carrier mobility graphene self-alignment process ensures edges source drain gate electrodes automatically precisely positioned overlapping significant gaps exist electrodes thus minimizing access resistance therefore allows transistor performance previously possible graphene transistors channel length low nm fabricated highest scaled on-current ma mu m- transconductance ms mu m- reported far significantly on-chip microwave measurements demonstrate self-aligned devices high intrinsic cut-off transit frequency ft ghz extrinsic ft range gigahertz largely limited parasitic pad capacitance reported intrinsic ft graphene transistors comparable best high-electron-mobility transistors similar gate lengths
