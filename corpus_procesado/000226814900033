crystal structure complex catalytic regulatory ri alpha subunits pka 
-angstrom structure cyclic adenosine monophosphate camp-dependent protein kinase pka catalytic subunit bound deletion mutant regulatory subunit rlalpha defines previously unidentified extended interface complex provides molecular mechanism inhibition pka suggests camp binding leads activation interface defines large lobe catalytic subunit stable scaffold tyr247 g helix trp196 phosphorylated activation loop serve anchor points binding rlalpha residues compete camp phosphate binding cassette rlalpha contrast catalytic subunit rlalpha undergoes major conformational changes complex compared camp-bound rlalpha inhibitor sequence docks active site whereas linker also disordered free rlalpha folds across extended interface beta barrel camp binding domain docking site camp remains largely intact complex whereas helical subdomain undergoes major reorganization
