phenomenon colossal magnetoresistance manganites1 generally agreed result competition crystal phases different electronic magnetic structural order; competition can strong enough cause phase separation metallic ferromagnetic insulating charge-modulated states2 nevertheless closer inspection phase diagrams many manganites reveals complex phases two order parameters magnetism charge modulation unexpectedly coexist67 show experiments can naturally explained within phenomenological ginzburg-landau theory contrast models phase separation originates disorder8 strain induced kinetic phenomenon9 argue magnetic charge modulation coexist new thermodynamic phases leads rich diagram equilibrium phases qualitatively similar seen experimentally success model argues fundamental reinterpretation nature charge modulation materials localized extended charge density wave picture symmetry considerations favour textured coexistence charge magnetic order may apply many electronic systems competing phases resulting electronically soft phases matter incommensurate inhomogeneous mixed order may general phenomena correlated systems
