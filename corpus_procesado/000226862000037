electronically soft phases manganites 
phenomenon colossal magnetoresistance manganites generally agreed result competition crystal phases different electronic magnetic structural order competition can strong enough cause phase separation metallic ferromagnetic insulating charge-modulated states nevertheless closer inspection phase diagrams many manganites reveals complex phases two order parameters magnetism charge modulation unexpectedly coexist show experiments can naturally explained within phenomenological ginzburg-landau theory contrast models phase separation originates disorder strain induced kinetic phenomenon argue magnetic charge modulation coexist new thermodynamic phases leads rich diagram equilibrium phases qualitatively similar seen experimentally success model argues fundamental reinterpretation nature charge modulation materials localized extended charge density wave picture symmetry considerations favour textured coexistence charge magnetic order may apply many electronic systems competing phases resulting electronically soft phases matter incommensurate inhomogeneous mixed order may general phenomena correlated systems
