synthesis self-pillared zeolite nanosheets repetitive branching 
hierarchical zeolites class microporous catalysts adsorbents also contain mesopores allow fast transport bulky molecules thereby enable improved performance petrochemical biomass processing used repetitive branching one-step hydrothermal crystal growth synthesize new hierarchical zeolite made orthogonally connected microporous nanosheets nanosheets nanometers thick contain network -nanometer micropores house-of-cards arrangement nanosheets creates permanent network -nanometer mesopores along high external surface area reduced micropore diffusion length account higher reaction rates bulky molecules relative mesoporous conventional mfi zeolites
