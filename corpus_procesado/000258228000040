using photoemission spectroscopy probe strongly interacting fermi gas
ultracold atomic gases provide model systems study many-body quantum physics recent experiments using fermi gases demonstrated phase transition superfluid state strong interparticle interactions- system provides realization bcs-bec crossover connecting physics bardeen-cooper-schrieffer bcs superconductivity bose-einstein condensates becs although many aspects system investigated yet possible measure single-particle excitation spectrum fundamental property directly predicted many-body theories use photoemission spectroscopy directly probe elementary excitations energy dispersion strongly interacting fermi gas k atoms experiments radio-frequency photon ejects atom strongly interacting system means spin-flip transition weakly interacting state measure occupied density single-particle states cusp bcs-bec crossover bec side crossover compare results nearly ideal fermi gas show near critical temperature single-particle spectral function dramatically altered way consistent large pairing gap results probe many-body physics way compared data high-transition-temperature superconductors photoemission spectroscopy electronic materials measurement technique ultracold atomic gases directly probes low-energy excitations thus can reveal excitation gaps and/or pseudogaps furthermore technique can provide analogue angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy probing anisotropic systems atoms optical lattice potentials
