inducible nitric oxide synthase binds s-nitrosylates activates cyclooxygenase-
cyclooxygenase cox- inducible nitric oxide synthase inos two major inflammatory mediators show inos specifically binds cox s-nitrosylates enhancing cox catalytic activity selectively disrupting inos-cox binding prevented no-mediated activation cox- synergistic molecular interaction two inflammatory systems may inform development anti-inflammatory drugs
