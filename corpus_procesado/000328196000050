exonic transcription factor binding directs codon choice affects protein evolution
genomes contain genetic code specifying amino acids regulatory code specifying transcription factor tf recognition sequences used genomic deoxyribonuclease footprinting map nucleotide resolution tf occupancy across human exome diverse cell types found similar % human codons dual-use codons duons simultaneously specify amino acids tf recognition sites duons highly conserved shaped protein evolution tf-imposed constraint appears major driver codon usage bias conversely regulatory code selectively depleted tfs recognize stop codons % single-nucleotide variants within duons directly alter tf binding pervasive dual encoding amino acid regulatory information appears fundamental feature genome evolution
