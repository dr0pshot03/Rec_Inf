neural mechanisms foraging 
behavioral economic studies involving limited numbers choices provided key insights neural decision-making mechanisms contrast animals foraging choices arise context sequences encounters prey food encounter animal chooses whether engage environment sufficiently rich search elsewhere cost foraging also critical demonstrate humans can alternate two modes choice comparative decision-making foraging depending distinct neural mechanisms ventromedial prefrontal cortex vmpfc anterior cingulate cortex acc using distinct reference frames; acc choice variables represented invariant reference foraging searching alternatives whereas vmpfc encodes values specific well-defined options acc encodes average value foraging environment cost foraging
