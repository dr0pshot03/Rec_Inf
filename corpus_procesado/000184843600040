regulatory evolution shavenbaby/ovo underlies multiple cases morphological parallelism
cases convergent evolution involve changes developmental pathway called parallelism provide evidence limited number developmental changes available evolve particular phenotype knowledge case genetic changes underlying morphological convergence understood however morphological convergence generally assumed imply developmental parallelism investigate case convergence larval morphology insects show loss particular trichomes observed one species drosophila melanogaster species group independently evolved multiple times distantly related d virilis species group present genetic gene expression data showing regulatory changes shavenbaby/ovo svb/ovo gene underlie independent cases morphological convergence results indicate developmental regulators might preferentially accumulate evolutionary changes morphological parallelism might therefore common previously appreciated
