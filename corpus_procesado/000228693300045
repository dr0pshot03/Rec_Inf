ikk alpha limits macrophage nf-kappa b activation contributes resolution inflammation 
inflammation innate immunity involve signalling pathways leading production inflammatory mediators usually responses self-limiting aberrant resolution inflammation results chronic diseases1 much attention focused pro-inflammatory signalling little known mechanisms resolve inflammation kappa b kinase ikk complex contains two catalytic subunits ikk alpha ikk beta controls activation nf-kappa b transcription factors play pivotal role inflammation2 ample evidence indicates ikk beta mediates nf-kappa b activation response pro-inflammatory cytokines microbial products ikk alpha regulates alternative pathway important lymphoid organogenesis2 role ikk alpha inflammation unknown describe new role ikk alpha negative regulation macrophage activation inflammation ikk alpha contributes suppression nf-kappa b activity accelerating turnover nf-kappa b subunits rela c-rel removal pro-inflammatory gene promoters inactivation ikk alpha mice enhances inflammation bacterial clearance hence two ikk catalytic subunits evolved opposing complimentary roles needed intricate control inflammation innate immunity
