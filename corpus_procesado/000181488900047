free fatty acids regulate insulin secretion pancreatic beta cells gpr40
diabetes disease carbohydrate lipid metabolism regulated improperly insulin serious worldwide health issue insulin secreted pancreatic beta cells response elevated plasma glucose various factors modifying secretion free fatty acids ffas provide important energy source nutrients also act signalling molecules various cellular processes including insulin secretion although ffas thought promote insulin secretion acute phase mechanism clearly understood show g-protein-coupled receptor gpr40 abundantly expressed pancreas functions receptor long-chain ffas furthermore show long-chain ffas amplify glucose-stimulated insulin secretion pancreatic beta cells activating gpr40 results indicate gpr40 agonists and/or antagonists show potential development new anti-diabetic drugs
