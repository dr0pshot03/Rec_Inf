tlr4 antagonist eritoran protects mice lethal influenza infection 
pressing need develop alternatives annual influenza vaccines antiviral agents licensed mitigating influenza infection previous studies reported acute lung injury caused chemical microbial insults secondary generation host-derived oxidized phospholipid potently stimulates toll-like receptor tlr4-dependent inflammation1 subsequently reported tlr4-/- mice highly refractory influenza-induced lethality2 proposed therapeutic antagonism tlr4 signalling protect influenza-induced acute lung injury report therapeutic administration eritoran also known e5564-a potent well-tolerated synthetic tlr4 antagonist34-blocks influenza-induced lethality mice well lung pathology clinical symptoms cytokine oxidized phospholipid expression decreases viral titres cd14 tlr2 also required eritoran-mediated protection cd14 directly binds eritoran inhibits ligand binding md2 thus eritoran blockade tlr signalling represents novel therapeutic approach inflammation associated influenza possibly infections
