large angular jump mechanism observed hydrogen bond exchange aqueous perchlorate solution
mechanism hydrogen bond h-bond switching solution remained subject debate despite extensive experimental theoretical studies applied polarization-selective multidimensional vibrational spectroscopy investigate h-bond exchange mechanism aqueous naclo solution results show water molecule shifts donated h-bonds water perchlorate acceptors means large prompt angular rotation using jump-exchange kinetic model extracted average jump angle +/ degrees qualitative agreement jump angle observed molecular dynamics simulations aqueous naclo solution
