evolution darwins finches beaks revealed genome sequencing
darwins finches inhabiting galapagos archipelago cocos island constitute iconic model studies speciation adaptive evolution report results whole-genome re-sequencing individuals representing darwins finch species two close relatives phylogenetic analysis reveals important discrepancies phenotype-based taxonomy find extensive evidence interspecific gene flow throughout radiation hybridization given rise species mixed ancestry kilobase haplotype encompassing alx1 gene encodes transcription factor affecting craniofacial development strongly associated beak shape diversity across darwins finch species well within medium ground finch geospiza fortis species undergone rapid evolution beak shape response environmental changes alx1 haplotype contributed diversification beak shapes among darwins finches thereby expanded utilization food resources
