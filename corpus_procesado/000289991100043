low-voltage low-power organic light-emitting transistors active matrix displays 
intrinsic nonuniformity polycrystalline-silicon backplane transistors active matrix organic light-emitting diode displays severely limits display size organic semiconductors might provide alternative mobility remains low useful conventional thin-film transistor design demonstrate organic channel light-emitting transistor operating low voltage low power dissipation high aperture ratio three primary colors high level performance enabled single-wall carbon nanotube network source electrode permits integration drive transistor light emitter efficient single stacked device performance demonstrated comparable polycrystalline-silicon backplane transistor-driven display pixels
