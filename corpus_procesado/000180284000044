drosophila blm double-strand break repair synthesis-dependent strand annealing
bloom syndrome characterized predisposition cancer caused mutation recq dna helicase gene blm precise function blm remains unclear previous research suggested drosophila blm functions repair dna double-strand breaks double-strand breaks flies repaired homologous recombination synthesis-dependent strand-annealing pathway demonstrate drosophila blm mutants severely impaired ability carry repair dna synthesis synthesis-dependent strand annealing consequently repair mutants completed error-prone pathways create large deletions results suggest model blm maintains genomic stability promoting efficient repair dna synthesis thereby prevents double-strand break repair less precise pathways
