agonist-bound adenosine a2a receptor structures reveal common features gpcr activation 
adenosine receptors beta-adrenoceptors g-protein-coupled receptors gpcrs activate intracellular g proteins binding agonists adenosine noradrenaline respectively gpcrs similar structures consisting seven transmembrane helices contain well-conserved sequence motifs indicating probably activated common mechanism recent structures beta-adrenoceptors highlight residues transmembrane region initially bind specifically agonists rather antagonists indicating residues important role agonist-induced activation receptors- present two crystal structures thermostabilized human adenosine a2a receptor a2ar-gl31 bound endogenous agonist adenosine synthetic agonist neca structures represent intermediate conformation inactive active states share features gpcrs thought fully activated state except cytoplasmic end transmembrane helix partially occludes g-protein-binding site adenine substituent agonists binds similar fashion chemically related region inverse agonist zm241385 ref agonists contain ribose group found zm241385 extends deep ligand-binding pocket makes polar interactions conserved residues h7 ser superscripts refer ballesteros-weinstein numbering non-polar interactions residues h3 contrast inverse agonist zm241385 interact residues comparison agonist-bound structures indicates zm241385 sterically prevents conformational change h5 therefore acts inverse agonist comparison agonist-bound structures a2ar agonist-bound structures beta-adrenoceptors indicates contraction ligand-binding pocket caused inward motion helices may common feature activation gpcrs
