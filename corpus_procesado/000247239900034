tuning quantum stability superconductivity ultrathin metal alloys
quantum confinement itinerant electrons atomically smooth ultrathin lead films produces strong oscillations thickness-dependent film energy adding extra electrons via bismuth alloying showed structural stability superconducting properties films can tuned phase boundary upper critical field superconducting vortex state normal state indicates anomalous suppression superconducting order just critical temperature tc suppression varies systematically film thickness bismuth content can parametrized terms characteristic temperature tc* less tc inversely proportional scattering mean free path results indicate isotropic nature superconductive pairing bulk lead-bismuth alloys altered quantum regime
