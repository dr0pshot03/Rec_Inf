chloroplast avoidance movement reduces photodamage plants
plants exposed light levels higher required photosynthesis reactive oxygen species generated chloroplasts cause photodamage can occur even natural growth conditions mitigate photodamage plants developed several protective mechanisms- one chloroplast avoidance movement- chloroplasts move cell surface side walls cells high light conditions although experimental support still awaited using different classes mutant defective chloroplast avoidance movement show mutants susceptible damage high light wild-type plants damage photosynthetic apparatus subsequent bleaching leaf colour necrosis occur faster high light conditions mutants wild-type plants conclude chloroplast avoidance movement actually decreases amount light absorption chloroplasts might therefore important survival plants natural growth conditions
