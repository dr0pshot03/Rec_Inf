primitive y chromosome papaya marks incipient sex chromosome evolution 
many diverse systems sex determination evolved plants animals- one involves physically distinct heteromorphic sex chromosomes x y z w homozygous one sex usually female heterozygous usually male sex chromosome evolution thought involve suppression recombination around sex determination genes rendering permanently heterozygous chromosomal region may accumulate deleterious recessive mutations mullers ratchet fix deleterious mutations hitchhiking nearby favourable mutations selected y chromosome time processes may cause y chromosome degenerate diverge x chromosome much length example % human y chromosome still shows x y recombination show papaya contains primitive y chromosome male-specific region accounts % chromosome undergone severe recombination suppression dna sequence degeneration finding provides direct evidence origin sex chromosomes autosomes
