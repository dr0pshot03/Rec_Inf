josephson junctions tunable weak links retracted article see vol pg
electrical properties organic molecular crystals polyacenes c can tuned insulating superconducting application electric field structuring gate electrode field-effect switch charge carrier density therefore also superfluid density can modulated hence weak links behave like josephson junctions can fabricated two superconducting regions coupling superconducting regions can tuned controlled wide range applied gate bias devices might used superconducting circuits useful scientific tool study superconducting material parameters superconducting gap function carrier concentration transition temperature
