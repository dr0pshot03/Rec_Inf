stabilizing isopeptide bonds revealed gram-positive bacterial pilus structure 
many bacterial pathogens long slender pili adhere host cells crystal structure major pilin subunit gram positive human pathogen streptococcus pyogenes angstroms resolution reveals extended structure comprising two all-beta domains molecules associate columns crystal carboxyl terminus adjacent conserved lysine next molecule lysine forms isopeptide bonds link subunits native pili validating relevance crystal assembly subunit contains two lysine-asparagine isopeptide bonds generated intramolecular reaction find evidence similar isopeptide bonds cell surface proteins gram positive bacteria present structure explains strength stability gram positive pili facilitate vaccine development
