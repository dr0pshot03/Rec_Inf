met amplification leads gefitinib resistance lung cancer activating erbb3 signaling
epidermal growth factor receptor egfr kinase inhibitors gefitinib erlotinib effective treatments lung cancers egfr activating mutations tumors invariably develop drug resistance describe gefitinib-sensitive lung cancer cell line developed resistance gefitinib result focal amplification met proto-oncogene inhibition met signaling cells restored sensitivity gefitinib met amplification detected % lung cancer specimens developed resistance gefitinib erlotinib find amplification met causes gefitinib resistance driving erbb3 her3-dependent activation pi3k pathway thought specific egfr/erbb family receptors thus propose met amplification may promote drug resistance erbb-driven cancers well
