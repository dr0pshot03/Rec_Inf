intergenic transcription required repress saccharomyces cerevisiae ser3 gene 
transcription rna polymerase ii saccharomyces cerevisiae humans widespread even genomic regions encode proteins- purpose intergenic transcription largely unknown although can regulatory discovered role one case intergenic transcription studying s cerevisiae ser3 gene previous results demonstrated transcription ser3 tightly repressed growth rich medium now show regulatory region gene highly transcribed conditions produces non-protein-coding rna srg1 expression srg1 rna required repression ser3 additional experiments demonstrated repression occurs transcription-interference mechanism srg1 transcription across ser3 promoter interferes binding activators work identifies previously unknown class transcriptional regulatory genes
