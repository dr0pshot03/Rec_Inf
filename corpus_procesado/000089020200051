eukaryotic polymerases iota zeta act sequentially bypass dna lesions 
dna lesions can often block dna replication cells possess specialized low-fidelity often error-prone dna polymerases can bypass lesions promote replication damaged dna saccharomyces cerevisiae rad30 human hrad30a encode pol eta bypasses cis-syn thymine-thymine dimer efficiently accurately- show related human gene hrad30b encodes dna polymerase pol iota misincorporates deoxynucleotides high rate bypass damage pol iota specifically incorporates deoxynucleotides opposite highly distorting non-instructional dna lesions action combined dna polymerase pol zeta essential damage-induced mutagenesis complete lesion bypass pol zeta inefficient inserting deoxynucleotides opposite dna lesions readily extends deoxynucleotides inserted thus new model mutagenic bypass dna lesions eukaryotes two dna polymerases act sequentially: pol iota incorporates deoxynucleotides opposite dna lesions pol zeta functions mispair extender
