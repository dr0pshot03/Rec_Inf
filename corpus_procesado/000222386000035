mass spectrometric imaging highly curved membranes tetrahymena mating 
biological membrane fusion crucial numerous cellular events including sexual reproduction exocytosis mass spectrometry images demonstrate low-curvature lipid phosphatidylcholine diminished membrane regions fusing tetrahymena multitude highly curved fusion pores exist additionally mass spectra principal component analysis indicate fusion region contains elevated amounts -aminoethylphosphonolipid high-curvature lipid evidence suggests biological fusion involves might fact driven heterogeneous redistribution lipids fusion site
