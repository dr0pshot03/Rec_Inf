self-directed growth molecular nanostructures silicon
advances techniques nanoscale manipulation matter important realization molecule-based miniature devices- new advanced functions particularly promising approach involves construction hybrid organic-molecule/silicon devices- challenges remain-both formation nanostructures will constitute active parts future devices construction commensurately small connecting wires atom-by-atom crafting structures scanning tunnelling microscopes- although essential fundamental advances slow practical fabrication process self-assembly approaches may permit rapid fabrication lack ability control growth location shape furthermore molecular diffusion silicon greatly inhibited thereby presenting problem self-assembly techniques report approach fabricating nanoscale organic structures silicon surfaces employing minimal intervention tip scanning tunnelling microscope spontaneous self-directed chemical growth process demonstrate growth straight molecular styrene lines-each composed many organic molecules-and crystalline silicon substrate determines orientation lines molecular spacing within lines process principle allow parallel fabrication identical complex functional structures
