structural basis activation class ib ribonucleotide reductase
class ib ribonucleotide reductase escherichia coli can initiate reduction nucleotides deoxynucleotides either mniii-tyrosyl radical y center dot feiii-y center dot cofactor nrdf subunit whereas feiii-y center dot can self-assemble feii-nrdf o activation mnii-nrdf requires reduced flavoprotein nrdi proposed form oxidant cofactor assembly reduction o crystal structures reported e coli mnii-nrdf feii-nrdf reveal different coordination environments suggesting distinct initial binding sites oxidants cofactor activation structures mnii-nrdf complex reduced oxidized nrdi continuous channel connects nrdi flavin cofactor nrdf mnii active site crystallographic detection putative peroxide channel supports proposed mechanism mniii-y center dot cofactor assembly
