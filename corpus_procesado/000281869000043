structural basis activation class ib ribonucleotide reductase 
class ib ribonucleotide reductase escherichia coli can initiate reduction nucleotides deoxynucleotides either mn2iii-tyrosyl radical y center dot fe2iii-y center dot cofactor nrdf subunit whereas fe2iii-y center dot can self-assemble fe2ii-nrdf o2 activation mn2ii-nrdf requires reduced flavoprotein nrdi proposed form oxidant cofactor assembly reduction o2 crystal structures reported e coli mn2ii-nrdf fe2ii-nrdf reveal different coordination environments suggesting distinct initial binding sites oxidants cofactor activation structures mn2ii-nrdf complex reduced oxidized nrdi continuous channel connects nrdi flavin cofactor nrdf mn2ii active site crystallographic detection putative peroxide channel supports proposed mechanism mn2iii-y center dot cofactor assembly
