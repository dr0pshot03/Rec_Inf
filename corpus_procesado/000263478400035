switching hydrogen peroxide hydrogenation direct synthesis process 
hydrogen peroxide ho important disinfectant bleach currently manufactured indirect process involving sequential hydrogenation/ oxidation anthaquinones however direct process h o reacted preferable unfortunately catalysts direct synthesis ho also effective subsequent decomposition limited development show acid pretreatment carbon support gold palladium alloy catalysts switches decomposition ho treatment decreases size alloy nanoparticles smaller nanoparticles presumably decorate inhibit sites decomposition reaction hence used direct synthesis ho acid pretreated catalysts give high yields ho hydrogen selectivities greater %
