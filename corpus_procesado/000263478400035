switching hydrogen peroxide hydrogenation direct synthesis process 
hydrogen peroxide h2o2 important disinfectant bleach currently manufactured indirect process involving sequential hydrogenation/ oxidation anthaquinones however direct process h2 o2 reacted preferable unfortunately catalysts direct synthesis h2o2 also effective subsequent decomposition limited development show acid pretreatment carbon support gold palladium alloy catalysts switches decomposition h2o2 treatment decreases size alloy nanoparticles smaller nanoparticles presumably decorate inhibit sites decomposition reaction hence used direct synthesis h2o2 acid pretreated catalysts give high yields h2o2 hydrogen selectivities greater %
