b cell ligand discrimination spreading contraction response 
b cells recognize foreign antigens virtue cell surface immunoglobulin receptors effectively activated membrane-bound ligands show early stages process b cells exhibit two-phase response first spread antigen-bearing membrane contract thereby collecting bound antigen central aggregate extent response signaling actin-dependent determines quantity antigen accumulated hence degree b cell activation brownian dynamic simulations reproduce essential features antigen collection process suggest possible basis affinity discrimination propose dynamic spreading important step immune response
