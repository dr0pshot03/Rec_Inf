evolutionary inheritance elemental stoichiometry marine phytoplankton
phytoplankton nineteenth century ecological construct biologically diverse group pelagic photoautotrophs share common metabolic functions evolutionary histories contrast terrestrial plants major schism occurred evolution eukaryotic phytoplankton gave rise two major plastid superfamilies- green superfamily appropriated chlorophyll b whereas red superfamily uses chlorophyll c accessory photosynthetic pigment fossil evidence suggests green superfamily dominated palaeozoic oceans however end-permian extinction members red superfamily rose ecological prominence processes responsible shift obscure present analysis major nutrients trace elements species marine phytoplankton two superfamilies results indicate systematic phylogenetic differences two plastid types macronutrient carbon:nitrogen:phosphorus stoichiometries primarily reflect ancestral pre-symbiotic host cell phenotypes trace element composition reflects differences acquired plastids compositional differences two plastid superfamilies suggest changes ocean redox state strongly influenced evolution selection eukaryotic phytoplankton since proterozoic era
