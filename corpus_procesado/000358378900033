catalytic asymmetric umpolung reactions imines 
carbon-nitrogen double bonds imines fundamentally important functional groups organic chemistry largely due fact imines act electrophiles towards carbon nucleophiles reactions form carbon-carbon bonds thereby serving one widely used precursors formation amines synthetic biosynthetic settings1- carbon atom imine rendered electron-rich imine react nucleophile instead electrophile reversal electronic characteristics imine functionality facilitate development new chemical transformations convert imines amines via carbon-carbon bond-forming reactions carbon electrophiles thereby creating new opportunities efficient synthesis amines development asymmetric umpolung reactions imines imines act nucleophiles remains uncharted territory spite far-reaching impact reactions organic synthesis report discovery development new chiral phase-transfer catalysts promote highly efficient asymmetric umpolung reactions imines carbon electrophile enals catalysts mediate deprotonation imines direct -azaallyl anions thus formed react enals highly chemoselective regioselective diastereoselective enantioselective fashion reaction tolerates broad range imines enals can carried high yield little mole per cent catalyst moisture-and air-tolerant operational protocol umpolung reactions provide conceptually new practical approach chiral amino compounds
