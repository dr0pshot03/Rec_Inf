single lgr5 stem cells build crypt-villus structures vitro without mesenchymal niche
intestinal epithelium rapidly self-renewing tissue adult mammals recently demonstrated presence six cycling lgr+ stem cells bottoms small-intestinal crypts describe establishment long-term culture conditions single crypts undergo multiple crypt fission events simultanously generating villus-like epithelial domains differentiated cell types present single sorted lgr+ stem cells can also initiate crypt-villus organoids tracing experiments indicate lgr+ stem-cell hierarchy maintained organoids conclude intestinal crypt-villus units self-organizing structures can built single stem cell absence non-epithelial cellular niche
