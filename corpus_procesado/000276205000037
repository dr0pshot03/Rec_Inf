phenotypic profiling human genome time-lapse microscopy reveals cell division genes
despite rapidly growing knowledge human genome know genes required basic functions life start fill gap developed high-throughput phenotypic screening platform combining potent gene silencing rna interference time-lapse microscopy computational image processing carried genome-wide phenotypic profiling similar human protein-coding genes two-day live imaging fluorescently labelled chromosomes phenotypes scored quantitatively computational image processing allowed us identify hundreds human genes involved diverse biological functions including cell division migration survival part mitocheck consortium study provides in-depth analysis cell division phenotypes makes entire high-content data set available resource community
