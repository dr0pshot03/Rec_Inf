climate sensitivity uncertainty need energy without co2 emission
un framework convention climate change calls stabilization greenhouse gas concentrations level prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference climate system even determine safe level interference climate system sensitivity global mean temperature increasing atmospheric co2 known perhaps factor three less show factor three uncertainty climate sensitivity introduces even greater uncertainty allowable increases atmospheric co2 concentration allowable co2 emissions nevertheless unless climate sensitivity low acceptable amounts climate change high climate stabilization will require massive transition co2 emission-free energy technologies
