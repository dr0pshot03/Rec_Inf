vivo discovery immunotherapy targets tumour microenvironment
recent clinical trials showed targeting inhibitory receptors t cells induces durable responses subset cancer patients despite advanced disease however regulatory switches controlling t-cell function immunosuppressive tumours well understood show inhibitory mechanisms can systematically discovered tumour microenvironment devised vivo pooled short hairpin rna shrna screen shrnas targeting negative regulators became highly enriched murine tumours releasing block t-cell proliferation upon tumour antigen recognition shrnas identified deep sequencing shrna cassette t cells infiltrating tumour control tissues one target genes ppp2r2d regulatory subunit pp2a phosphatase family tumours ppp2r2d knockdown inhibited t-cell apoptosis enhanced t-cell proliferation well cytokine production key regulators immune function can therefore discovered relevant tissue microenvironments
