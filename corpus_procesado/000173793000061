mantle flow field beneath western north america
although motions surface tectonic plates well determined accompanying horizontal mantle flow combined observations surface deformation upper mantle seismic anisotropy estimate flow field western north america find mantle velocity +/ centimeters per year due east hot spot reference frame nearly opposite direction north american plate motion west-southwest flow weakly coupled motion surface plate producing small drag force flow field probably due heterogeneity mantle density associated former farallon oceanic plate beneath north america
