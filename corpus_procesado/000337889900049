nucleoside diphosphate kinases fuel dynamin superfamily proteins gtp membrane remodeling 
dynamin superfamily molecular motors use guanosine triphosphate gtp source energy membrane-remodeling events found knockdown nucleoside diphosphate kinases ndpks nm23-h1/h2 produce gtp adenosine triphosphate atp-driven conversion guanosine diphosphate gdp inhibited dynamin-mediated endocytosis nm23-h1/h2 localized clathrin-coated pits interacted proline-rich domain dynamin vitro nm23-h1/h2 recruited dynamin-induced tubules stimulated gtp-loading dynamin triggered fission presence atp gdp nm23-h4 mitochondria-specific ndpk colocalized mitochondrial dynamin-like opa1 involved mitochondria inner membrane fusion increased gtp-loading opa1 like opa1 loss function silencing nm23-h4 nm23-h1/h2 resulted mitochondrial fragmentation reflecting fusion defects thus ndpks interact provide gtp dynamins allowing motor proteins work high thermodynamic efficiency
