jupiters atmosphere observed voyager space craft images characterized zonal jet streams vortices largest great red spot three white ovals formed 1930s great red spot observed continuously since given dynamical similarities great red spot white ovals disappearance two white ovals unexpected longevity sudden demise explained however trapping anticyclonic vortices troughs rossby waves forcing merge propose disappearance white ovals isolated event part recurring climate cycle will cause jupiters vortices disappear within next decade numerical simulations loss vortices results global temperature change k destabilizes atmosphere thereby leads formation new vortices formation large vortices eroded turbulence time similar to60 years-consistent observations white ovals-until disappear cycle begins
