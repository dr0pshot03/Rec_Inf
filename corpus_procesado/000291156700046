glutamate induces de novo growth functional spines developing cortex 
mature cortical pyramidal neurons receive excitatory inputs onto small protrusions emanating dendrites called spines spines undergo activity-dependent remodelling stabilization pruning development similar structural changes can triggered learning changes sensory experiences1- however biochemical triggers mechanisms de novo spine formation developing brain functional significance new spines neuronal connectivity largely unknown develop approach induce monitor de novo spine formation real time using combined two-photon laser-scanning microscopy two-photon laser uncaging glutamate data demonstrate mouse cortical layer / pyramidal neurons glutamate sufficient trigger de novo spine growth dendrite shaft location-specific manner find glutamate-induced spinogenesis requires opening nmdars n-methyl-d-aspartate-type glutamate receptors activation protein kinase pka independent calcium-calmodulin-dependent kinase ii camkii tyrosine kinase receptor b trkb receptors furthermore newly formed spines express glutamate receptors rapidly functional transduce presynaptic activity postsynaptic signals together data demonstrate early neural connectivity shaped activity spatially precise manner nascent dendrite spines rapidly functionally incorporated cortical circuits
