loss avian phylogenetic diversity neotropical agricultural systems
habitat conversion primary driver biodiversity loss yet little known restructuring tree life favoring lineages others combined complete avian phylogeny years costa rican bird surveys detections across species sampled three land uses: forest reserves diversified agricultural systems intensive monocultures diversified agricultural systems supported million years evolutionary history intensive monocultures million fewer years forests compared species many extant relatives evolutionarily distinct species extirpated higher rates diversified intensive agricultural systems forests therefore essential maintaining diversity across tree life diversified agricultural systems may help buffer extreme loss phylogenetic diversity
