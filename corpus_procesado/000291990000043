levy walks evolve interaction movement environmental complexity
ecological theory predicts animal movement shaped efficiency resource acquisition focusing solely efficiency however ignores fact animal activity can affect resource availability distribution show feedback individual behavior environmental complexity can explain movement strategies mussels specifically experiments show mussels use levy walk formation spatially patterned beds models reveal levy movement accelerates pattern formation emergent patterning mussel beds turn improves individual fitness results suggest levy walks evolved result selective advantage conferred autonomously generated emergent spatial patterns mussel beds results emphasize interaction individual selection habitat complexity shapes animal movement natural systems
