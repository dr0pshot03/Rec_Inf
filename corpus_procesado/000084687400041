reverse microemulsion synthesis nanostructured complex oxides catalytic combustion
catalysts play important role many industrial processes use high-temperature applications-such energy generation natural gas combustion steam reforming partial oxidation hydrocarbons produce feedstock chemicals-is problematic need catalytic materials remain stable active long periods high operation temperatures often presence deactivating even poisoning compounds presents challenge example catalytic methane combustion generates power reduced greenhouse-gas nitrogen-oxide emissions- limited availability catalysts sufficiently active low temperatures start-up able sustain activity mechanical integrity flame temperatures high degrees c use sol-gel processing reverse microemulsions produce discrete barium hexaaluminate nanoparticles display excellent methane combustion activity owing high surface area high thermal stability ultrahigh dispersion cerium oxide surfaces synthesis method provides general route production wide range thermally stable nanostructured composite materials large surface-to-volume ratios- ultrahigh component dispersion gives rise synergistic chemical electronic effects thus paving way development catalysts suitable high-temperature industrial applications
