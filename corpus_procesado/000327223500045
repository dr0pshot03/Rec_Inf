human language-associated gene srpx2 regulates synapse formation vocalization mice 
synapse formation developing brain depends coordinated activity synaptogenic proteins implicated number neurodevelopmental disorders show sushi repeat-containing protein x-linked srpx2 gene encodes protein promotes synaptogenesis cerebral cortex humans srpx2 epilepsy language-associated gene target foxhead box protein p2 foxp2 transcription factor also show foxp2 modulates synapse formation regulating srpx2 levels srpx2 reduction impairs development ultrasonic vocalization mice results suggest foxp2 modulates development neural circuits regulating synaptogenesis srpx2 synaptogenic factor plays role pathogenesis language disorders
