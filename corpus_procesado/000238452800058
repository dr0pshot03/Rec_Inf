metagenomic analysis coastal rna virus communities 
rna viruses infect marine organisms bacteria whales rna virus communities sea remain essentially unknown reverse-transcribed whole-genome shotgun sequencing used characterize diversity uncultivated marine rna virus assemblages diverse assemblage rna viruses including broad group marine picorna-like viruses distant relatives viruses infecting arthropods higher plants found communities dominated distinct genotypes small genome sizes completely assembled genomes several hitherto undiscovered viruses results show oceans reservoir previously unknown rna viruses
