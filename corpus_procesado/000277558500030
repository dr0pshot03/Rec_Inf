time-resolved observation coherent multi-body interactions quantum phase revivals
interactions lie heart correlated many-body quantum phases- typically interactions microscopic particles described two-body interactions however shown higher-order multi-body interactions give rise novel quantum phases intriguing properties far multi-body interactions observed inelastic loss resonances three-and four-body recombinations atom-atom atom-molecule collisions- demonstrate presence effective multi-body interactions system ultracold bosonic atoms three-dimensional optical lattice emerging virtual transitions particles lowest energy band higher energy bands observe interactions six-body case time-resolved traces quantum phase revivals- using atom interferometric technique allows us precisely measure absolute energies atom number states lattice site addition show spectral content time traces can reveal atom number statistics lattice site similar foundational experiments cavity quantum electrodynamics yield statistics cavity photon field precision measurement multi-body interaction energies provides crucial input comparison optical-lattice quantum simulators many-body quantum theory
