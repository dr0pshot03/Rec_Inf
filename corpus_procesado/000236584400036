cobalt-base high-temperature alloys
identified cobalt-base superalloys showing high-temperature strength greater conventional nickel-base superalloys cobalt-base alloys strengthened ternary compound l1 structure gamma co- alw precipitates disordered gamma face-centered cubic cobalt matrix high coherency high melting points also identified ternary compound gamma ir-al w l1 structure suggests co-ir-al-w-base systems gamma + gamma co iral w structures offer great promise candidates next-generation high-temperature materials
