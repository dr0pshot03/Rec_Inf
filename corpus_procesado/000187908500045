periodic pulsing characteristic microearthquakes san andreas fault 
deep fault slip information characteristically repeating microearthquakes reveals previously unrecognized patterns extensive large-amplitude long-duration quasiperiodic repetition aseismic events along much -kilometer segment central san andreas fault pulsing occurs conjunction independent transient slip larger earthquakes extends depths similar to10 kilometers may deeper may related similar phenomena occurring subduction zones much study area pulse onset periods also show higher probability larger earthquakes may provide useful information earthquake forecasting
