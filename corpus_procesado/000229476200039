design effective immunotherapy human autoimmunity
better understanding molecules involved immune responses identified many potential targets treatment autoimmune diseases although successful therapies found immune disorders animal studies passed much harder test treating human diseases far non-antigen-specific approaches blocking tumour-necrosis factor achieving success true antigen-specific approaches future therapies will probably include non-antigen-specific strategies target cytokines cell cell signalling molecules block molecules stimulate immune responses antigen-specific therapies induce tolerance self antigens
