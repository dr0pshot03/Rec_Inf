neural activity human hippocampal formation reveals spatial context retrieved memories
many species spatial navigation supported network place cells exhibit increased firing whenever animal certain region environment neural representation location form part spatiotemporal context episodic memories encoded recorded medial temporal lobe neuronal activity epilepsy patients performed hybrid spatial episodic memory task identified place-responsive cells active virtual navigation asked whether cells activated subsequent recall navigation-related memories without actual navigation place-responsive cell activity reinstated episodic memory retrieval neuronal firing retrieval memory similar activity represented locations environment memory initially encoded
