glucose deprivation contributes development kras pathway mutations tumor cells 
tumor progression driven genetic mutations little known environmental conditions select mutations studying transcriptomes paired colorectal cancer cell lines differed mutational status kras braf genes found glut1 encoding glucose transporter- one three genes consistently up-regulated cells kras braf mutations mutant cells exhibited enhanced glucose uptake glycolysis survived low-glucose conditions phenotypes required glut1 expression contrast cells wild-type kras alleles subjected low-glucose environment cells survived surviving cells expressed high levels glut1 % survivors acquired kras mutations present parents glycolysis inhibitor bromopyruvate preferentially suppressed growth cells kras braf mutations together data suggest glucose deprivation can drive acquisition kras pathway mutations human tumors
