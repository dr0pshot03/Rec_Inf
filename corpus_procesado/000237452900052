hypothalamic mtor signaling regulates food intake
mammalian target rapamycin mtor protein serine-threonine kinase regulates cell-cycle progression growth sensing changes energy status demonstrated mtor signaling plays role brain mechanisms respond nutrient availability regulating energy balance rat mtor signaling controlled energy status specific regions hypothalamus colocalizes neuropeptide y proopiomelanocortin neurons arcuate nucleus central administration leucine increases hypothalamic mtor signaling decreases food intake body weight hormone leptin increases hypothalamic mtor activity inhibition mtor signaling blunts leptins anorectic effect thus mtor cellular fuel sensor whose hypothalamic activity directly tied regulation energy intake
