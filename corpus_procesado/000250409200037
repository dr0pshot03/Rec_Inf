outward transport high-temperature materials around midplane solar nebula
stardust samples collected comet 81p/wild indicate large-scale mixing occurred solar nebula carrying materials hot inner regions cooler environments far sun similar transport inferred telescopic observations protoplanetary disks around young stars models protoplanetary disks however difficulty explaining observed levels transport report results new two-dimensional model shows outward transport high-temperature materials protoplanetary disks natural outcome disk formation evolution outward transport occurs around midplane disk
