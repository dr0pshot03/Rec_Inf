neural constraints learning
learning whether motor sensory cognitive requires networks neurons generate new activity patterns behaviours easier learn others asked neural activity patterns easier generate others investigate whether existing network constrains patterns subset neurons capable exhibiting principles define constraint employed closed-loop intracortical brain-computer interface learning paradigm rhesus macaques macaca mulatta controlled computer cursor modulating neural activity patterns primary motor cortex using brain-computer interface paradigm specify alter neural activity mapped cursor velocity start session observed characteristic activity patterns recorded neural population activity neural population can represented high-dimensional space termed neural space wherein dimension corresponds activity one neuron characteristic activity patterns comprise low-dimensional subspace termed intrinsic manifold within neural space intrinsic manifold presumably reflects constraints imposed underlying neural circuitry show animals readily learn proficiently control cursor using neural activity patterns within intrinsic manifold however animals less able learn proficiently control cursor using activity patterns outside intrinsic manifold results suggest existing structure network can shape learning timescale hours seems difficult learn generate neural activity patterns consistent existing network structure findings offer network-level explanation observation readily able learn new skills related skills already possess
