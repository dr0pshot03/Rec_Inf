phylogenetic mcmc algorithms misleading mixtures trees 
markov chain monte carlo mcmc algorithms play critical role bayesian approach phylogenetic inference present theoretical analysis rate convergence many widely used markov chains n characters generated uniform mixture two trees prove markov chains take exponentially long n number iterations converge posterior distribution nevertheless likelihood plots sample runs markov chains deceivingly suggest chains converge rapidly unique tree results rely novel mathematical understanding log-likelihood function space phylogenetic trees practical implications work bayesian mcmc methods can misleading data generated mixture trees thus cases data containing potentially conflicting phylogenetic signals phylogenetic reconstruction performed separately signal
