strongly linked current flow polycrystalline forms superconductor mgb2 
discovery superconductivity k magnesium diboride1 mgb2 raises many issues critical one whether material resembles high-temperature copper oxide superconductor low-temperature metallic superconductor terms behaviour strong magnetic fields although copper oxides exhibit high transition temperatures in-field performance2 compromized large anisotropy result restrict high bulk current densities region much less full magnetic-field-temperature h-t space superconductivity found moreover weak coupling across grain boundaries makes transport current densities untextured polycrystalline samples low strongly sensitive magnetic field34 report despite multiphase untextured microscale subdivided nature mgb2 samples supercurrents flow throughout material without exhibiting strong sensitivity weak magnetic fields3 combined magnetization magneto-optical microscopy x-ray investigations show supercurrent density mostly determined flux pinning rather grain boundary connectivity results therefore suggest new superconductor class compromized weak-link problems conclusion significance practical applications higher temperature analogues compound can discovered
