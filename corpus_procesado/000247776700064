buddenbrockia cnidarian worm
major evolutionary divide occurs animal kingdom so-called radially symmetric animals includes cnidarians bilaterally symmetric animals includes worm phyla buddenbrockia plumatellae active muscular parasitic worm belongs phylum myxozoa group morphologically simplified microscopic endoparasites proved difficult place phylogenetically phylogenetic analyses multiple protein-coding genes demonstrate buddenbrockia cnidarian active muscular worm increases known diversity cnidarian body plans demonstrates muscular wormlike form can evolve absence overt bilateral symmetry
