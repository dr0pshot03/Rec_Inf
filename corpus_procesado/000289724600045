genome-wide analysis reveals novel molecular features mouse recombination hotspots 
meiotic recombination predominantly occurs discrete genomic loci called recombination hotspots features defining areas still largely unknown reviewed refs - allow comprehensive analysis hotspot-associated dna chromatin characteristics developed direct molecular approach mapping meiotic dna double-strand breaks initiate recombination present genome-wide distribution recombination initiation sites mouse genome hotspot centres mapped approximately -nucleotide precision allows analysis fine structural details preferred recombination sites determine hotspots share centrally distributed consensus motif possess nucleotide skew changes polarity centres hotspots intrinsic preference occupied nucleosome furthermore find vast majority recombination initiation sites mouse males associated testis-specific trimethylation lysine histone h3 distinct histone h3 lysine trimethylation marks associated transcription recombination map presented derived homogeneous mouse population defined genetic background therefore lends extensive future experimental exploration note mapping technique developed depend availability genetic markers hence can easily adapted species complex genomes findings uncover several fundamental features mammalian recombination hotspots underline power new recombination map future studies genetic recombination genome stability evolution
