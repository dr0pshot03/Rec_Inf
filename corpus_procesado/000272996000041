binary star fraction per cent unusual orbit parameters blue stragglers ngc 
blue straggler stars lie near main sequences star clusters members formed around time typically luminous turn-off stars therefore long ago evolved main sequence become giants white dwarfs thought derive normal main-sequence stars undergone recent increase mass statistical evidence indicates globular star clusters blue stragglers probably form binary stars specific formation processes mass transfer mergers stellar collisions dynamical encounters binary stars remain unresolved report blue stragglers per cent old -gyr ref open cluster ngc188 currently binary systems frequency three times found among normal solar-type main-sequence stars blue straggler binaries remarkable period-eccentricity distribution three orbital periods similar days moreover stars rotating faster normal main-sequence stars surface temperatures data show possibly blue stragglers derive multiple-star systems indicate several formation processes operate simultaneously suggest rapid rotation blue stragglers may place upper limits ages
