epidermal merkel cells mechanosensory cells tune mammalian touch receptors 
touch submodalities flutter pressure mediated somatosensory afferents whose terminal specializations extract tactile features encode action potential trains unique activity patterns whether non-neuronal cells tune touch receptors active passive mechanisms debated terminal specializations thought function passive mechanical filters analogous cochleas basilar membrane deconstructs complex sounds tones transduced mechanosensory hair cells model cutaneous specializations merely passive recently challenged epidermal cells express sensory ion channels neurotransmitters however direct evidence epidermal cells excite tactile afferents lacking epidermal merkel cells display features sensory receptor cells make synapse-like contacts slowly adapting type sai afferents- complexes encode spatial features edges texture localize skin regions high tactile acuity including whisker follicles fingertips touch domes show merkel cells actively participate touch reception mice merkel cells display fast touch-evoked mechanotransduction currents optogenetic approaches intact skin show merkel cells necessary sufficient sustained action-potential firing tactile afferents recordings touch-dome afferents lacking merkel cells demonstrate merkel cells confer high-frequency responses dynamic stimuli enable sustained firing data first knowledge directly demonstrate functional excitatory connection epidermal cells sensory neurons together findings indicate merkel cells actively tune mechanosensory responses facilitate high spatio-temporal acuity moreover results indicate division labour merkel cell-neurite complex: merkel cells signal static stimuli pressure whereas sensory afferents transduce dynamic stimuli moving gratings thus merkel cell-neurite complex unique sensory structure composed two different receptor cell types specialized distinct elements discriminative touch
