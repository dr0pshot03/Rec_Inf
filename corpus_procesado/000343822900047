computational design water-soluble alpha-helical barrels
design protein sequences fold prescribed de novo structures challenging general solutions problem require geometric descriptions protein folds methods fit sequences a-helical coiled coils present promising class protein offer considerable scope exploring hitherto unseen structures a-helical barrels four helices accessible central channels many possible structures remain unobserved combine geometrical considerations knowledge-based scoring atomistic modeling facilitate design new channel-containing a-helical barrels x-ray crystal structures resulting designs match predicted silico models furthermore observed channels chemically defined diameters related oligomer state present routes design protein function
