pdk1 nucleates t cell receptor-induced signaling complex nf-kappa b activation
activation transcription factor nf-kappa b engagement t cell receptor tcr important t cell proliferation activation adaptive immune response recent reports elucidated signaling pathway involves protein kinase c theta pkc theta scaffold protein card11 also called carma- caspase recruitment domain card-containing protein bcl10 paracaspase protease related caspases malt1 critical intermediates linking tcr kappa b kinase ikk complex however events proximal tcr initiate activation signaling pathway remain poorly defined demonstrate phosphoinositide-dependent kinase pdk1 essential role pathway regulating activation pkc theta signal-dependent recruiting pkc theta card11 lipid rafts pdk1-associated pkc theta recruits ikk complex whereas pdk1-associated card11 recruits bcl10-malt1 complex thereby allowing activation ikk complex bcl10-malt1-dependent ubiquitination ikk complex subunit known nemo nf-kappa b essential modifier hence pdk1 plays critical role nucleating tcr-induced nf-kappa b activation pathway t cells
