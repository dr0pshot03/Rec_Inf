multipotent drosophila intestinal stem cells specify daughter cell fates differential notch signaling 
adult drosophila midgut contains multipotent intestinal stem cells iscs scattered along basement membrane shown lineage analysis generate enterocytes enteroendocrine cells iscs containing high levels cytoplasmic delta-rich vesicles activate canonical notch pathway down-regulate delta within daughters process programs daughters become enterocytes iscs express little vesiculate delta genetically impaired notch signaling specify daughters become enteroendocrine cells thus iscs control daughter cell fate modulating notch signaling time studies suggest iscs actively coordinate cell production local tissue requirements mechanism
