galvanic replacement reactions metal oxide nanocrystals
galvanic replacement reactions provide simple versatile route producing hollow nanostructures controllable pore structures compositions however reactions previously limited chemical transformation metallic nanostructures demonstrated galvanic replacement reactions metal oxide nanocrystats well manganese oxide mn3o4 nanocrystals reacted ironii perchlorate hollow box-shaped nanocrystats mn3o4/gamma-fe2o3 nanoboxes produced nanoboxes ultimately transformed hollow cagetike nanocrystats gamma-fe2o3 nanocages nonequihbrium compositions hollow structures nanoboxes nanocages exhibited good performance anode materials lithium ion batteries generality approach demonstrated metal pairs including co3o4/sno2 mn3o4/sno2
