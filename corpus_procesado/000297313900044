homonuclear molecule permanent electric dipole moment 
permanent electric dipole moments molecules require breaking parity symmetry conventionally symmetry breaking relies presence heteronuclear constituents report observation permanent electric dipole moment homonuclear molecule binding based asymmetric electronic excitation atoms exotic molecules consist ground-state rubidium rb atom bound inside second rb atom electronically excited high-lying rydberg state detailed calculations predict appreciable dipole moments order debye excellent agreement observations
