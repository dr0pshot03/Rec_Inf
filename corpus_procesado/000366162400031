principles assembly reveal periodic table protein complexes 
structural insights protein complexes broad impact understanding biological function evolution work sought comprehensive understanding general principles underlying quaternary structure organization protein complexes first examined fundamental steps protein complexes can assemble using experimental structure-based characterization assembly pathways assembly transitions can classified three basic types can used exhaustively enumerate large set possible quaternary structure topologies topologies include vast majority observed protein complex structures enable natural organization protein complexes periodic table basis table can accurately predict expected frequencies quaternary structure topologies including yet observed results important implications quaternary structure prediction modeling engineering
