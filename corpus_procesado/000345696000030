mammalian skin cell biology: interface laboratory clinic
mammalian skin research represents convergence three complementary disciplines: cell biology mouse genetics dermatology skin provides paradigm current research cell adhesion inflammation tissue stem cells discuss recent insights cell biology skin single-cell analysis revealed human epidermal stem cells heterogeneous differentiate response multiple extrinsic signals live-cell imaging optogenetics cell ablation experiments show skin cells remarkably dynamic high-throughput genome-wide approaches yielded unprecedented insights circuitry controls epidermal stem cell fate last integrative biological analysis human skin disorders revealed unexpected functions elements skin previously considered purely structural
