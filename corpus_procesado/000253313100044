martian stepped-delta formation rapid water release 
deltas alluvial fans preserved surface mars provide important record surface water flow- understanding surface water flow produced observed morphology fundamental understanding history water mars date morphological studies provided minimum time estimates longevity martian hydrologic events range decades millions years- use sand flume studies show distinct morphology martian stepped terraced deltas- originated single basin filling event timescale tens years stepped deltas therefore provide minimum maximum constraint duration magnitude surface flows mars estimate amount water required fill basin deposit delta comparable amount water discharged large terrestrial rivers mississippi massive discharge short timescale associated short canyon lengths favour hypothesis stepped fans terraced delta deposits draped alluvial fan formed water released suddenly subsurface storage
