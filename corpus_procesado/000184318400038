epitaxial self-assembly block copolymers lithographically defined nanopatterned substrates
parallel processes patterning densely packed nanometre scale structures critical many diverse areas nanotechnology thin films diblock copolymers- can self-assemble ordered periodic structures molecular scale similar to5 nm used templates fabricate quantum dots nanowires- magnetic storage media nanopores silicon capacitors unfortunately perfect periodic domain ordering can achieved micrometre-scale areas best defects exist edges grain boundaries limitations preclude use block-copolymer lithography many advanced applications graphoepitaxy in-plane electric fields temperature gradients directional solidification also demonstrated induce orientation long-range order varying degrees success demonstrate integration thin films block copolymer advanced lithographic techniques induce epitaxial self-assembly domains resulting patterns defect-free oriented registered underlying substrate can created arbitrarily large areas structures determined size quality lithographically defined surface pattern rather inherent limitations self-assembly process results illustrate hybrid strategies nanofabrication allow molecular level control existing manufacturing processes
