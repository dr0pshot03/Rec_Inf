hybridization adaptive mate choice flycatchers 
hybridization natural populations strongly selected hybrid offspring reduced fitness show paradoxically pairing another species may offer best fitness return individual despite reduced fitness hybrid offspring two mechanisms reduce costs female collared flycatchers pairing male pied flycatchers large proportion young sired conspecific male collared flycatchers extra-pair copulations bias favour male offspring unlike females fertile within hybrid pairs combination temporal variation breeding success cost-reducing mechanisms yield quantitative predictions female collared flycatchers accept male pied flycatcher mate; empirical data agree predictions apparent hybridization may thus represent adaptive mate choice circumstances
