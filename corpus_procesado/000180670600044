human population size growth rate often considered important drivers biodiversity loss- whereas household dynamics usually neglected aggregate demographic statistics may mask substantial changes size number households effects biodiversity household dynamics influence per capita consumption thus biodiversity example consumption wood fuel habitat alteration home building associated activities- greenhouse gas emissions report growth household numbers globally particularly countries biodiversity hotspots areas rich endemic species threatened human activities rapid aggregate population growth even population size declined number households increased substantially average household size number occupants remained static million fewer households hotspot countries reduction average household size alone will add projected million additional households hotspot countries period rapid increase household numbers often manifested urban sprawl resultant higher per capita resource consumption smaller households- pose serious challenges biodiversity conservation
