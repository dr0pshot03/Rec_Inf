checkpoint-dependent inhibition dna replication initiation sld3 dbf4 phosphorylation 
initiation eukaryotic dna replication regulated three protein kinase classes: cyclin-dependent kinases cdk dbf4-dependent kinase ddk dna damage checkpoint kinases cdk phosphorylation two key initiation factors sld2 sld3 promotes essential interactions dpb11 refs whereas ddk acts phosphorylating subunits mcm2 helicase cdk additional role replication preventing re-loading mcm2 s g2 m phases thus preventing origin re-firing re-replication g1 phase cdk ddk downregulated allows origin licensing prevents premature replication initiation origin firing also inhibited s phase dna damage replication fork stalling activates checkpoint kinases- show analogous situation g1 phase saccharomyces cerevisiae checkpoint kinase rad53 inhibits cdk ddk-dependent pathways acts redundantly block origin firing rad53 acts ddk directly phosphorylating dbf4 whereas cdk pathway blocked rad53-mediated phosphorylation downstream cdk substrate sld3 allows cdk remain active s phase presence dna damage crucial prevent re-loading mcm2 onto origins already fired results explain checkpoints regulate origin firing demonstrate slowing s phase intra-s checkpoint primarily due inhibition origin firing
