rab5 signalling gtpase involved actin remodelling receptor tyrosine kinases 
rab5 small gtpase involved control intracellular trafficking level receptor endocytosis endosomal dynamics finding rab5 can activated receptor tyrosine kinases rtk raised question whether also participates effector pathways emanating receptors show rab5 indispensable form rtk-induced actin remodelling called circular ruffling three independent signals originating rab5 phosphatidylinositol--oh kinase rac respectively simultaneously required induction circular ruffles rab5 signals actin cytoskeleton rn-tre previously identified rab5-specific gtpase-activating protein gap demonstrate rn-tre dual function rab-gap rab5 effector also show rn-tre critical macropinocytosis process previously connected formation circular ruffles finally rn-tre interacts f-actin actinin- f-actin bundling protein propose rn-tre establishes three-pronged connection rab5 f-actin actinin- may aid crosslinking actin fibres actin networks plasma membrane thus shown rab5 signalling gtpase elucidated major molecular elements downstream pathway
