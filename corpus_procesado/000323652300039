electron acceleration heart van allen radiation belts 
van allen radiation belts contain ultrarelativistic electrons trapped earths magnetic field since discovery fundamental unanswered question electrons can accelerated high energies two classes processes proposed: transport acceleration electrons source population located outside radiation belts radial acceleration acceleration lower-energy electrons relativistic energies situ heart radiation belts local acceleration report measurements nasas van allen radiation belt storm probes clearly distinguish two types acceleration observed radial profiles phase space density characteristic local acceleration heart radiation belts inconsistent predominantly radial acceleration process
