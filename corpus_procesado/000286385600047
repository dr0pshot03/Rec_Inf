supermassive black holes correlate dark matter haloes galaxies
supermassive black holes detected galaxies contain bulge components galaxies observed close enough searches feasible together observation bigger black holes live bigger bulges- led belief black-hole growth bulge formation regulate black holes bulges coevolve therefore reports similar correlation black holes dark matter haloes visible galaxies embedded profound implications dark matter likely non-baryonic reports suggest unknown exotic physics controls black-hole growth show part basis recent measurements bulgeless galaxies almost correlation dark matter parameters measure black holes unless galaxy also contains bulge conclude black holes correlate directly dark matter correlate galaxy disks either therefore black holes coevolve bulges simplifies puzzle coevolution focusing attention purely baryonic processes galaxy mergers make bulges
