one sequence two ribozymes: implications emergence new ribozyme folds
describe single rna sequence can assume either two ribozyme folds catalyze two respective reactions two ribozyme fords share evolutionary history completely different base pairs rand probably hydrogen bonds common minor variants sequence highly active one reaction can accessed prototype ribozymes series neutral mutations thus course evolution new rna folds arise preexisting folds without need carry inactive intermediate sequences raises possibility biological rnas structural functional similarity might share common ancestry furthermore functional structural divergence might cases precede rather follow gene duplication
