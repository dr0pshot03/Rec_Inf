intestinal microbiota promote enteric virus replication systemic pathogenesis 
intestinal bacteria aid host health limit bacterial pathogen colonization however influence bacteria enteric viruses largely unknown depleted intestinal microbiota mice antibiotics inoculation poliovirus enteric virus antibiotic-treated mice less susceptible poliovirus disease supported minimal viral replication intestine exposure bacteria n-acetylglucosamine-containing surface polysaccharides including lipopolysaccharide peptidoglycan enhanced poliovirus infectivity found poliovirus binds lipopolysaccharide exposure poliovirus bacteria enhanced host cell association infection pathogenesis reovirus unrelated enteric virus also severe presence intestinal microbes results suggest antibiotic-mediated microbiota depletion diminishes enteric virus infection enteric viruses exploit intestinal microbes replication transmission
