lateralization magnetic compass orientation migratory bird 
lateralization brain functions believed human characteristic now found widespread among vertebrates1- birds asymmetries visual functions well studied hemisphere specialized different tasks4- report lateralized functions birds visual system associated magnetoperception resulting extreme asymmetry sensing direction magnetic field found captive migrants tested cages magnetic field available orientation cue well oriented appropriate migratory direction using right eye failed show significant directional preference using left eye implies magnetoreception compass orientation assumed take place eyes alongside visual processes9- strongly lateralized marked dominance right eye/left brain hemisphere
