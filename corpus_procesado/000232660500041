helium solubility olivine implications high he/he ocean island basalts
high he/ ratios found ocean island basalts main evidence existence undegassed mantle reservoir- however models helium isotope evolution depend critically chemical behaviour helium mantle melting generally assumed helium strongly enriched mantle melts relative uranium thorium yet estimates helium partitioning mantle minerals produced conflicting results- present experimental measurements helium solubility olivine atmospheric pressure natural synthetic olivines equilibrated % helium atmosphere analysed crushing vacuo followed melting yield minimum olivine-melt partition coefficient +/ sd maximum +/ sd results indicate helium might compatible uranium thorium mantle melting high he/ ratios can preserved depleted residues melting depleted source high he/ ocean island basalts resolve apparent discrepancy relative helium concentrations ocean island mid-ocean-ridge basalts
