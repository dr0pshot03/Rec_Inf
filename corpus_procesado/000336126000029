role senescent cells ageing
cellular senescence historically viewed irreversible cell-cycle arrest mechanism acts protect cancer recent discoveries extended known role complex biological processes development tissue repair ageing age-related disorders new insights indicate unlike static endpoint senescence represents series progressive phenotypically diverse cellular states acquired initial growth arrest deeper understanding molecular mechanisms underlying multi-step progression senescence development function acute versus chronic senescent cells may lead new therapeutic strategies age-related pathologies extend healthy lifespan
