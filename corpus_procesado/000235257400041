plasticization-enhanced hydrogen purification using polymeric membranes
polymer membranes attractive molecular-scale separations hydrogen purification inherently low energy requirements however membrane materials outstanding hydrogen separation performance feed streams containing high-pressure carbondioxide impurities hydrogen sulfide water available report highly permeable reverse-selective membrane materials hydrogen purification exemplified molecularly engineered highly branched cross-linked polyethylene oxide contrast performance conventional materials demonstrate plasticization can harnessed improve separation performance
