coupled spatial variations precipitation long-term erosion rates across washington cascades
past studies tectonically active mountain ranges suggested strong coupling feedbacks climate tectonics topography example rock uplift generates topographic relief thereby enhancing precipitation focuses erosion turn influences rates spatial patterns rock uplift although theoretical links climate erosion uplift received much attention studies shown convincing correlations observable indices processes mountain range scales show strongly varying long term> yr erosion rates inferred apatite u th/ cooling ages across cascades mountains washington state closely track modern mean annual precipitation rates erosion precipitation rates vary order magnitude across range maxima mm yr- m yr- respectively maxima located km west windward topographic crest range data demonstrate strong coupling precipitation long term erosion rates mountain range scale range currently topographic steady state rock uplift west flank three ten times faster elsewhere range possibly response climatically focused erosion
