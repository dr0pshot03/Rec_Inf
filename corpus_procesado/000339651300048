helminth infection reactivates latent gamma-herpesvirus via cytokine competition viral promoter
mammals coinfected multiple pathogens interact unknown mechanisms found helminth infection characterized induction cytokine interleukin il- activation transcription factor stat6 reactivated murine gamma-herpesvirus infection vivo il promoted viral replication blocked antiviral effects interferon-gamma ifn gamma inducing stat6 binding promoter important viral transcriptional transactivator il also reactivated human kaposis sarcoma-associated herpesvirus latency cultured cells exogenous il plus blockade ifn gamma reactivated latent murine gamma-herpesvirus infection vivo suggesting two-signal model viral reactivation thus chronic herpesvirus infection component mammalian virome regulated counterpoised actions multiple cytokines viral promoters evolved sense host immune status
