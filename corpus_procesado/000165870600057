bacterial flagellar cap rotary promoter flagellin self-assembly
growth bacterial flagellar filament occurs distal end self-assembly flagellin transported cytoplasm narrow central channel cap growing end essential growth remaining stably attached permitting flagellin insertion order understand assembly mechanism used electron microscopy study structures cap-filament complex isolated cap dimer five log-like anchor domains pentameric cap flexibly adjusted conformations keep just one flagellin binding site open indicating cap rotation mechanism promote flagellin self-assembly represents one dynamic movements protein structures
