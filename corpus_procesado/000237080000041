dislocation multi-junctions strain hardening 
microscopic scale strength crystal derives motion multiplication interaction distinctive line defects called dislocations first proposed theoretically refs explain low magnitudes crystal strength observed experimentally existence dislocations confirmed two decades later much research dislocation physics since focused dislocation interactions role strain hardening common phenomenon continued deformation increases crystals strength existing theory relates strain hardening pair-wise dislocation reactions two intersecting dislocations form junctions tie dislocations together report interactions among three dislocations result formation unusual elements dislocation network topology termed multi-junctions first predict existence multi-junctions using dislocation dynamics atomistic simulations confirm existence transmission electron microscopy experiments single-crystal molybdenum large-scale dislocation dynamics simulations multi-junctions present strong nearly indestructible obstacles dislocation motion furnish new sources dislocation multiplication thereby playing essential role evolution dislocation microstructure strength deforming crystals simulation analyses conclude multi-junctions responsible strong orientation dependence strain hardening body-centred cubic crystals
