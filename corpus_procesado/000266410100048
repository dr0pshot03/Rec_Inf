high-frequency long-range coupling prefrontal visual cortex attention
electrical recordings humans monkeys show attentional enhancement evoked responses gamma synchrony ventral stream cortical areas synchrony result intrinsic activity visual cortex inputs structures using paired recordings frontal eye field fef area v4 found attention stimulus joint receptive field leads enhanced oscillatory coupling two areas particularly gamma frequencies coupling appeared initiated fef time-shifted milliseconds across range frequencies considering expected conduction synaptic delays areas time-shifted coupling gamma frequencies may optimize postsynaptic impact spikes one area upon improving cross-area communication attention
