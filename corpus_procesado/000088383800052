chfr defines mitotic stress checkpoint delays entry metaphase 
chemicals target microtubules induce mitotic stress affecting several processes occur mitosis processes include separation centrosomes prophase alignment chromosomes spindle metaphase sister-chromatid separation anaphase many human cancers sensitive mitotic stress sensitivity exploited therapy implies checkpoint defects- known mitotic checkpoint genes prevent entry anaphase chromosomes properly aligned mitotic spindle however rarely inactivated human cancer- describe chfr gene inactivated owing lack expression mutation four eight human cancer cell lines examined normal primary cells tumour cell lines express wild-type chfr exhibited delayed entry metaphase centrosome separation inhibited mitotic stress contrast tumour cell lines lost chfr function entered metaphase without delay ectopic expression wild-type chfr restored cell cycle delay increased ability cells survive mitotic stress thus chfr defines checkpoint delays entry metaphase response mitotic stress
