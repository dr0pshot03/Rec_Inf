hot-electron transfer semiconductor nanocrystals 
typical semiconductor solar cells photons energies semiconductor bandgap generate hot charge carriers quickly cool energy can captured process limits device efficiency although fabricating semiconductor nanocrystalline morphology can slow cooling transfer hot carriers electron hole acceptors yet thoroughly demonstrated used time-resolved optical second harmonic generation observe hot-electron transfer colloidal lead selenide pbse nanocrystals titanium dioxide tio2 electron acceptor appropriate chemical treatment nanocrystal surface transfer occurred much faster expected moreover electric field resulting sub--femtosecond charge separation across pbse-tio2 interface excited coherent vibrations tio2 surface atoms whose motions followed real time
