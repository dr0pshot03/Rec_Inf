acceleration quantum decay processes frequent observations 
theory decay unstable quantum state can inhibited sufficiently frequent measurements-the quantum zeno effect- although prediction tested transitions two coupled essentially stable states- quantum zeno effect thought general feature quantum mechanics applicable radioactive radiative decay processes generality arises assumption principle successive observations can made time intervals short system change appreciably- show quantum zeno effect fundamentally unattainable radiative radioactive decay required measurement rates cause system disintegrate also processes may accelerated frequent measurements find modification decay process determined energy spread incurred measurements result time-energy uncertainty relationand distribution states decaying state coupled whereas inhibitory quantum zeno effect may feasible limited class systems opposite effect-accelerated decay-appears much ubiquitous
