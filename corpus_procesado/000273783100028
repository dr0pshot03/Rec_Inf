formation iapetus extreme albedo dichotomy exogenically triggered thermal ice migration 
extreme albedo asymmetry saturns moon iapetus times bright trailing hemisphere leading hemisphere enigma three centuries deposition exogenic dark material leading side proposed cause alone explain global shape sharpness complexity transition iapetus bright dark terrain demonstrate characteristics asymmetrys large amplitude can plausibly explained runaway global thermal migration water ice triggered deposition dark material leading hemisphere mechanism unique iapetus among saturnian satellites slow rotation produces unusually high daytime temperatures water ice sublimation rates given albedo
