combined analog action potential coding hippocampal mossy fibers
mammalian cortex generally assumed output information neurons encoded number timing action potentials show using direct patch-clamp recordings presynaptic hippocampal mossy fiber boutons axons transmit analog signals addition action potentials excitatory presynaptic potentials result subthreshold dendritic synaptic inputs propagate several hundreds micrometers along axon modulate action potential-evoked transmitter release mossy fiber-ca3 synapse combined analog action potential coding represents additional mechanism information transmission major hippocampal pathway
