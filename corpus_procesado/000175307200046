reduction cytochrome c oxidase second electron leads proton translocation 
cytochrome c oxidase terminal enzyme cellular respiration mitochondria many bacteria reduces o water four-electron reduction process coupled translocation pumping four protons across mitochondrial bacterial membrane however proton pumping poorly understood proton pumping thought linked exclusively oxidative phase transfer third fourth electron upon re-evaluation data however proposal questioned transport mechanism including proton pumping reductive phase-that transfer first two electrons-was suggested subsequently additional studies reported proton pumping reductive phase can occur immediately preceded oxidative phase help clarify issue measured generation electric potential across membrane starting defined one-electron reduced state show second electron transfer enzyme leads charge translocation corresponding pumping one proton without necessity preceding turnover
