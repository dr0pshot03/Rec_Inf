presynaptic kainate receptor mediation frequency facilitation hippocampal mossy fiber synapses 
inhibition transmitter release presynaptic receptors widespread central nervous system typically mediated via metabotropic receptors contrast little known facilitatory receptors synaptic activation facilitatory autoreceptor established show activation presynaptic kainate receptors can facilitate transmitter release hippocampal mossy fiber synapses synaptic activation presumed ionotropic kainate receptors fast < ms lasts seconds thus presynaptic kainate receptors contribute shortterm plasticity characteristics mossy fiber synapses previously thought intrinsic property synapse
