trail geometry gives polarity ant foraging networks 
pheromone trails used many ants guide foragers nest food1- forager become displaced trail know way go rejoining trail laden forager example walk towards nest polarized trails enable ants choose appropriate direction thereby saving time reducing predation risk however previous research found evidence ants can detect polarity pheromone trail alone35- pharaohs ants monomorium pharaonis produce elaborate trail networks throughout foraging environment8 show using information geometry trail bifurcations within network foragers joining trail can adaptively reorientate initially walk wrong direction frequency correct reorientations maximized trail bifurcation angle approximately degrees found natural networks first data demonstrate ant trails can provide polarity information also demonstrate previously unsuspected sophistication organization information content networks insect societies
