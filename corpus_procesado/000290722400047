species-area relationships always overestimate extinction rates habitat loss
extinction habitat loss signature conservation problem twenty-first century despite importance estimating extinction rates still highly uncertain proven direct methods reliable data exist verifying extinctions widely used indirect method estimate extinction rates reversing species-area accumulation curve extrapolating backwards smaller areas calculate expected species loss estimates extinction rates based method almost always much higher actually observed- discrepancy gave rise concept extinction debt referring species committed extinction owing habitat loss reduced population size yet extinct non-equilibrium period show extinction debt currently defined largely sampling artefact due unrecognized difference underlying sampling problems constructing species-area relationship sar extrapolating species extinction habitat loss key mathematical result area required remove last individual species extinction larger almost always much larger sample area needed encounter first individual species irrespective species distribution spatial scale illustrate results data global network large mapped forest plots ranges passerine bird species continental usa show overestimation can greater % although conclude extinctions caused habitat loss require greater loss habitat previously thought results must lead complacency extinction due habitat loss real growing threat
