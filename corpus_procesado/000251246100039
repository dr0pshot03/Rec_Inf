coherent control single electron spin electric fields 
manipulation single spins essential spin-based quantum information processing electrical control instead magnetic control particularly appealing purpose electric fields easy generate locally on-chip experimentally realized coherent control single-electron spin quantum dot using oscillating electric field generated local gate electric field induced coherent transitions rabi oscillations spin-up spin-down rotations fast similar nanoseconds analysis indicated electrically induced spin transitions mediated spin-orbit interaction taken together recently demonstrated coherent exchange two neighboring spins results establish feasibility fully electrical manipulation spin qubits
