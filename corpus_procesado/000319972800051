repeated cortico-striatal stimulation generates persistent ocd-like behavior 
although cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical cstc circuit dysregulation correlated obsessive compulsive disorder ocd causation tested humans used optogenetics mice simulate cstc hyperactivation observed ocd patients whereas acute orbitofrontal cortex ofc-ventromedial striatum vms stimulation produce repetitive behaviors repeated hyperactivation multiple days generated progressive increase grooming mouse behavior related ocd increased grooming persisted weeks stimulation cessation grooming increase temporally coupled progressive increase light-evoked firing postsynaptic vms cells increased grooming evoked firing reversed chronic fluoxetine first-line ocd treatment brief repeated episodes abnormal circuit activity may thus set stage development persistent psychopathology
