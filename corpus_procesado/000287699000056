suppression collisional shifts strongly interacting lattice clock 
optical lattice clocks extremely stable frequency possible many atoms interrogated simultaneously precision may come cost systematic inaccuracy resulting atomic interactions density-dependent frequency shifts can occur even clock uses fermionic atoms subject inhomogeneous optical excitation however sufficiently strong interactions can suppress collisional shifts lattice sites containing one atom demonstrated effectiveness approach strontium lattice clock reducing collisional frequency shift uncertainty level - result eliminates compromise precision accuracy many-particle system; will continue improve number particles increases
