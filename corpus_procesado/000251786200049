allometric degree distributions facilitate food-web stability 
natural ecosystems species linked feeding interactions determine energy fluxes create complex food webs stability food webs enables many species coexist form diverse ecosystems recent theory finds predator prey body mass ratios critically important food web stability- however mechanisms responsible stability unclear use bioenergetic consumer resource model explore particular predator prey body mass ratios promote stability tri trophic three species food chains find persistence domain ratios constrained bottom energy availability predators much smaller prey enrichment driven dynamics predators much larger also find % tri trophic food chains across five natural food webs exhibit body mass ratios within predicted persistence domain analyses randomly rewired food webs show body mass allometric degree distributions natural food webs mediate consistency allometric degree distributions hold diversity species predators prey decreases increases respectively increasing species body masses results demonstrate simple relationships species body masses feeding interactions may promote stability complex food webs
