incremental training increases plasticity auditory space map adult barn owls 
plasticity central nervous system underlies learning generally restricted adults young animals1- one well-studied example auditory localization pathway shown far limited capacity adjust abnormal experience adult juvenile barn owls5 plasticity pathway induced exposing owls prismatic spectacles cause large horizontal shift visual field prisms juveniles learn new associations auditory cues interaural time difference itd locations visual space acquire new neurophysiological maps itd optic tectum whereas adults neither6 show prismatic shift experienced small increments maps itd adults change adaptively established incremental training new itd maps can reacquired single large prismatic shift results show substantially greater capacity plasticity adults previously recognized highlight principled strategy tapping capacity applied areas adult central nervous system
