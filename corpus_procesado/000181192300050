foraging adaptation relationship food-web complexity stability 
ecological theory suggests complex food webs persist inherent instability real ecosystems often support large number interacting species mathematical model shows fluctuating short-term selection trophic links arising consumers adaptive food choice key long-term stability complex communities without adaptive foragers food-web complexity destabilizes community composition whereas presence complexity may enhance community persistence facilitation dynamical food-web reconstruction buffers environmental fluctuations model predicts linkage pattern consistent field observations
