mechanism linking extra centrosomes chromosomal instability
chromosomal instability cin hallmark many tumours correlates presence extra centrosomes- however direct mechanistic link extra centrosomes cin established proposed extra centrosomes generate cin promoting multipolar anaphase highly abnormal division produces three aneuploid daughter cells use long-term live-cell imaging demonstrate cells multiple centrosomes rarely undergo multipolar cell divisions progeny divisions typically inviable thus multipolar divisions explain observed rates cin contrast observe cin cells extra centrosomes routinely undergo bipolar cell divisions display significantly increased frequency lagging chromosomes anaphase define mechanism underlying mitotic defect generated cells differ centrosome number demonstrate extra centrosomes alone sufficient promote chromosome missegregation bipolar cell division segregation errors consequence cells passing transient multipolar spindle intermediate merotelic kinetochore-microtubule attachment errors accumulate centrosome clustering anaphase findings provide direct mechanistic link extra centrosomes cin two common characteristics solid tumours propose mechanism may common underlying cause cin human cancer
