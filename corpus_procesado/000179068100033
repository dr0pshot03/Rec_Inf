pressure-induced crystallization spin liquid
liquids expected crystallize low temperature exception helium can remain liquid k owing quantum fluctuations similarly atomic magnetic moments spins magnet expected order temperature scale set curie-weiss temperature thetacw ref geometrically frustrated magnets represent exception systems pairwise spin interactions simultaneously minimized lattice symmetry can stabilize liquid-like state short-range-ordered fluctuating moments well thetacw refs use neutron scattering observe spin liquid state geometrically frustrated system tbtio conditions high pressure similar to9 gpa low temperature k compound three-dimensional magnet thetacw k negative value indicates antiferromagnetic interactions ambient pressure tbtio remains spin liquid state least mk ref find high pressure spins start order crystallize k antiferromagnetic order coexisting liquid-like fluctuations results indicate spin liquid/solid mixture can induced pressure geometrically frustrated systems
