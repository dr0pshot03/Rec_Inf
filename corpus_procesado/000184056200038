superluminal slow light propagation room-temperature solid 
observed superluminal ultraslow light propagation alexandrite crystal room temperature group velocities slow meters per second fast meters per second measured attributed influence coherent population oscillations involving chromium ions either mirror inversion sites within crystal lattice namely ions mirror sites inversely saturable cause superluminal light propagation whereas ions inversion sites experience conventional saturable absorption produce slow light technique producing large group indices considerably easier existing methods implement therefore suitable diverse applications
