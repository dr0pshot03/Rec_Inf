knowing boundaries: extending differential adhesion hypothesis embryonic cell sorting 
successful embryogenesis requires proper sorting compartmentalization different cell types mechanical interactions cells help govern processes past physics-based theories guided vitro studies cell sorting tissue surface tension recent experiments challenged approach indicating adhesive molecules also act signaling molecules initiate local reorganization actomyosin demonstrating cells boundary colony initially identical cells become "mechanically polarized" extending physical models account mechanical polarization helps solve long-standing paradox magnitudes tissue surface tensions potentially explains discrepancies recent vivo vitro cell-sorting experiments new experiments needed explore connection mechanical polarization tissue boundary formation vivo
