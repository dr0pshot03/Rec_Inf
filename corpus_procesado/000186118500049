yip3 catalyses dissociation endosomal rab-gdi complexes 
human cells contain small g proteins rab family localized surfaces distinct membrane compartments regulate transport vesicle formation motility docking fusion- prenylated rabs also occur cytosol bound gdi guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor binds rabs inactive state prenyl rab-gdi complexes contain information necessary direct rab delivery onto distinct membrane compartments- late endosomal prenyl rab9 binds gdi high affinity led us propose might gdi-displacement factor catalyse dissociation rab-gdi complexes enable transfer rabs gdi onto membranes indeed previously shown endosomal membranes contain proteinaceous factor can act manner show integral membrane protein yip3 acts catalytically dissociate complexes endosomal rabs bound gdi deliver onto membranes propose conserved yip proteins serve gdi-displacement factors targeting rab gtpases eukaryotic cells
