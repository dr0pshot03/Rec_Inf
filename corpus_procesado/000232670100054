fine-scale map recombination rates hotspots across human genome
genetic maps document way recombination rates vary genome essential tool many genetic analyses present high-resolution genetic map human genome based statistical analyses genetic variation data identify recombination hotspots together motifs sequence contexts play role hotspot activity differences behavior recombination rates large megabase small kilobase scales lead us suggest two-stage model recombination hotspots stochastic features within framework large-scale rates constrained
