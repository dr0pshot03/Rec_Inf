compartmentalized calcium transients trigger dendrite pruning drosophila sensory neurons
dendrite pruning critical sculpting final connectivity neural circuits removes inappropriate projections yet neurons can selectively eliminate unnecessary dendritic branches remains elusive show calcium transients compartmentalized specific dendritic branches act temporal spatial cues trigger pruning drosophila sensory neurons calcium transients occurred local dendrites similar hours branch elimination dendritic branches intrinsic excitability increased locally activate calcium influx via voltage-gated calcium channels vgccs blockade vgcc activities impaired pruning genetic analyses suggest calcium-activated protease calpain functions downstream calcium transients findings reveal importance compartmentalized subdendritic calcium signaling spatiotemporally selective elimination dendritic branches
