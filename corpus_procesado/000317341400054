guanosine-centric mechanism rna chaperone function
rna chaperones ubiquitous heterogeneous proteins essential rna structural biogenesis function investigated mechanism chaperone-mediated rna folding following time-resolved dimerization packaging domain retroviral rna nucleotide resolution absence nucleocapsid nc chaperone dimerization proceeded multiple slow-folding intermediates presence nc dimerization occurred rapidly single structural intermediate rna binding domain heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein a1 protein structurally unrelated chaperone also accelerated dimerization chaperones interacted primarily guanosine residues replacing guanosine weakly pairing inosine yielded rna folded rapidly without facilitating chaperone results show rna chaperones can simplify rna folding landscapes weakening intramolecular interactions involving guanosine explain many rna chaperone activities
