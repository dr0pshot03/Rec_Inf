rapid reductions north atlantic deep water peak last interglacial period
deep ocean circulation considered relatively stable interglacial periods yet little known behavior submillennial time scales using subcentennially resolved epibenthic foraminiferal delta c record show influence north atlantic deep water nadw strong onset last interglacial period interrupted several prominent centennial-scale reductions nadw transients occurred periods increased ice rafting southward expansions polar water influence suggesting buoyancy threshold convective instability triggered freshwater circum-arctic cryosphere changes deep atlantic chemical changes similar magnitude associated glaciations implying canonical view relatively stable interglacial circulation may hold conditions warmer fresher present
