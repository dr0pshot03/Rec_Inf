dissection genetically complex traits extremely large pools yeast segregants 
heritable traits including many human diseases caused multiple loci studies humans model organisms yeast failed detect large fraction loci underlie complex traits lack statistical power identify multiple loci small effects undoubtedly one primary reasons problem developed method yeast allows use much larger sample sizes previously possible hence permits detection multiple loci small effects method involves generating large numbers progeny cross two saccharomyces cerevisiae strains phenotyping genotyping pools offspring applied method chemical resistance traits mitochondrial function identified loci phenotypes show level genetic complexity underlying quantitative traits highly variable traits influenced one major locus others least loci results provide empirical demonstration genetic complexity number traits show possible identify many underlying factors using straightforward techniques method broad applications yeast can extended organisms
