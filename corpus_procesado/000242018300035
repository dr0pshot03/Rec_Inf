comparative chemosensation receptors ecology
odour perception initiated specific interactions odorants large repertoire receptors olfactory neurons past years considerable progress made tracing olfactory perception odorant receptor protein activity olfactory neurons higher processing centres ultimately behaviour complete picture emerging simplest olfactory system studied fruitfly drosophila melanogaster comparison rodent insect nematode olfaction reveals surprising differences unexpected similarities among chemosensory systems
