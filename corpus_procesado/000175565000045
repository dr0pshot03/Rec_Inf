e-coli btucd structure: framework abc transporter architecture mechanism
abc transporters ubiquitous membrane proteins couple adenosine triphosphate atp hydrolysis translocation diverse substrates across cell membranes clinically relevant examples associated cystic fibrosis multidrug resistance pathogenic bacteria cancer cells report crystal structure angstrom resolution escherichia coli btucd protein abc transporter mediating vitamin b uptake two atp-binding cassettes btud close contact two membrane-spanning subunits btuc arrangement distinct observed e coli lipid flippase msba btuc subunits provide transmembrane helices grouped around translocation pathway closed cytoplasm gate region whereas dimer arrangement btud subunits resembles atp-bound form rad50 dna repair enzyme prominent cytoplasmic loop btuc forms contact region atp-binding cassette appears represent conserved motif among abc transporters
