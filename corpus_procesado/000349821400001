distribution escrt machinery hiv assembly sites reveals virus scaffolding escrt subunits 
human immunodeficiency virus hiv hijacks endosomal sorting complexes required transport escrt mediate virus release infected cells nanoscale organization escrt machinery necessary mediating viral abscission unclear applied three-dimensional superresolution microscopy correlative electron microscopy delineate organization escrt components hiv assembly sites observed escrt subunits localized within head budding virions released particles head-localized levels chmp2a decreasing relative tsg101 chmp4b upon virus abscission thus driving force hiv release may derive initial scaffolding escrt subunits within viral bud interior followed plasma membrane association selective remodeling escrt subunits
