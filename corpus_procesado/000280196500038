dnmt3a-dependent nonpromoter dna methylation facilitates transcription neurogenic genes 
dna methylation proximal promoters facilitates lineage restriction silencing cell type-specific genes however euchromatic dna methylation frequently occurs regions outside promoters functions nonproximal promoter dna methylation unclear show de novo dna methyltransferase dnmt3a expressed postnatal neural stem cells nscs required neurogenesis genome-wide analysis postnatal nscs indicates dnmt3a occupies methylates intergenic regions gene bodies flanking proximal promoters large cohort transcriptionally permissive genes many encode regulators neurogenesis surprisingly dnmt3a-dependent nonproximal promoter methylation promotes expression neurogenic genes functionally antagonizing polycomb repression thus nonpromoter dna methylation dnmt3a may used maintaining active chromatin states genes critical development
