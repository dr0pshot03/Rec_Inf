tric channels essential ca2+ handling intracellular stores
cell signalling requires efficient ca2+ mobilization intracellular stores ca2+ release channels well predicted counter-movement ions across sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum membrane balance transient negative potential generated ca2+ release- ca2+ release channels cloned years ago whereas molecular identity putative counter ion channels remains unknown report two tric trimeric intracellular cation channel subtypes differentially expressed intracellular stores animal cell types tric subtypes contain three proposed transmembrane segments form homo-trimers bullet-like structure electrophysiological measurements purified tric preparations identify monovalent cation-selective channel tric-knockout mice suffering embryonic cardiac failure mutant cardiac myocytes show severe dysfunction intracellular ca2+ handling tric-deficient skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum shows reduced k+ permeability well altered ca2+ spark signalling voltage-induced ca2+ release therefore tric channels likely act counter ion channels function synchronization ca2+ release intracellular stores
