crystal structure parallel quadruplexes human telomeric dna 
telomeric ends chromosomes comprise noncoding repeat sequences guanine-rich dna fundamental protecting cell recombination degradation disruption telomere maintenance leads eventual cell death can exploited therapeutic intervention cancer telomeric dna sequences can form four-stranded quadruplex structures- may involved structure telomere ends describe crystal structure quadruplex formed four consecutive human telomeric dna repeats grown k+ concentration approximates intracellular concentration k+ ions observed structure folding appearance dna intramolecular quadruplex fundamentally different published na+-containing quadruplex structures four dna strands parallel three linking trinucleotide loops positioned exterior quadruplex core propeller-like arrangement adenine tta linking trinucleotide loop swung back intercalates two thymines dna structure suggests straightforward path telomere folding unfolding well ways can recognize telomere-associated proteins
