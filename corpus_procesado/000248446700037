ferromagnet continuously tunable random field
physical biological systems disordered even though majority theoretical models treat disorder weak perturbation one particularly simple system ferromagnet approaching curie temperature tc spins associated partially filled atomic shells acquire parallel orientation addition disorder way chemical substitution curie point suppressed qualitatively new phenomena appear bulk measurements long disorder truly random atomic scale large eliminate ferromagnetism entirely report discovery simply measured magnetic response singular curie temperature model disordered magnet associated singularity grows anomalous divergence tc origin singular response random internal field induced external magnetic field transverse favoured direction magnetization- fact ferromagnets can studied easily high precision using bulk susceptibility large variety imaging tools will advance fundamental studies random field problem also suggests mechanism tuning strength domain wall pinning key applications
