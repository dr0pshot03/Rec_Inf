physical limits design principles plant fungal movements 
typical scales plant fungal movements vary many orders magnitude time length ultimately based hydraulics mechanics show quantification length time scales involved plant fungal motions leads natural classification whose physical basis can understood analysis mechanics water transport elastic tissue study also suggests design principle nonmuscular hydraulically actuated structures: rapid actuation requires either small size enhancement motion large scales via elastic instabilities
