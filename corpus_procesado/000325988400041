tet enzymes tdg dynamics dna demethylation
dna methylation profound impact genome stability transcription development although enzymes catalyse dna methylation well characterized involved methyl group removal remained elusive recently transformative discovery ten-eleven translocation tet family enzymes can oxidize methylcytosine greatly advanced understanding dna demethylation hydroxymethylcytosine key nexus demethylation can either passively depleted dna replication actively reverted cytosine iterative oxidation thymine dna glycosylase tdg-mediated base excision repair methylation oxidation repair now offer model complete cycle dynamic cytosine modification mounting evidence significance biological processes known involve active demethylation
