finding functional features saccharomyces genomes phylogenetic footprinting 
sifting winnowing dna sequence occur evolution cause nonfunctional sequences diverge leaving phylogenetic footprints functional sequence elements comparisons genome sequences searched footprints among genome sequences six saccharomyces species identified potentially functional sequences comparison sequences allowed us revise catalog yeast genes identify sequence motifs may targets transcriptional regulatory proteins conserved sequence motifs reside upstream genes similar functional annotations similar expression patterns bound transcription factor thus good candidates functional regulatory sequences
