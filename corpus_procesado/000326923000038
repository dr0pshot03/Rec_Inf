cytoplasmic volume modulates spindle size embryogenesis
rapid reductive cell divisions embryogenesis require intracellular structures adapt wide range cell sizes mitotic spindle presents central example flexibility scaling dimensions cell mediate accurate chromosome segregation determine whether spindle size regulation achieved developmental program intrinsically specified cell size shape developed system encapsulate cytoplasm xenopus eggs embryos inside cell-like compartments defined sizes spindle size observed shrink decreasing compartment size similar occurs early embryogenesis scaling trend depended compartment volume rather shape thus amount cytoplasmic material provides mechanism regulating size intracellular structures
