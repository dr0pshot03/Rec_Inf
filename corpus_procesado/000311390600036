forming moon earth-like composition via giant impact 
giant impact theory moon formed debris ejected earth-orbiting disk collision large planet early earth prior impact simulations predict much disk material originates colliding planet however earth moon essentially identical oxygen isotope compositions challenge impact theory impactors composition likely differed earth simulated impacts involving larger impactors previously considered show can produce disk composition planets mantle consistent earth-moon compositional similarities impacts require subsequent removal angular momentum earth-moon system resonance sun recently proposed
