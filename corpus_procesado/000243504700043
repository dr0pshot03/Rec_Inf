critical ligamentous mechanism evolution avian flight 
despite recent advances aerodynamic neuromuscular- kinematic aspects avian flight dozens relevant fossil discoveries origin aerial locomotion transition limbs wings continue debated interpreting transition depends understanding mechanical interplay forces living birds particularly shoulder wing motion takes place shoulder function depends balance forces muscles ligaments articular cartilages well inertial gravitational aerodynamic loads wing show force balance system shoulder evolved primarily muscular mechanism one acrocoracohumeral ligament critical role features shoulder mesozoic birds closely related theropod dinosaurs indicate evolution flight preceded acquisition ligament-based force balance system basal birds intermediate shoulder morphology
