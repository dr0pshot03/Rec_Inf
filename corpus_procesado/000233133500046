deterministic nature earthquake rupture
understanding earthquake rupture process central understanding fault systems earthquake hazards multiple hypotheses concerning nature fault rupture proposed unifying theory emerged- conceptual hypothesis commonly cited cascade model fault rupture cascade model slip initiates small fault patch continues rupture across fault plane long conditions favourable two fundamental implications domino-like theory small earthquakes begin manner large earthquakes rupture process deterministic size earthquake determined cessation rupture show frequency content radiated seismic energy within first seconds rupture scales final magnitude event infer magnitude earthquake can therefore estimated rupture complete finding implies rupture process degree deterministic implications physics rupture process
