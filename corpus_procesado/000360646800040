colloidal matter: packing geometry entropy
colloidal particles well-controlled shapes interactions ideal experimental system exploring matter organizes like atoms molecules particles form bulk phases liquids crystals just crude analogs atoms form matter right complex interesting collective behavior seen atomic scale behavior affected geometrical topological constraints curved surfaces shapes particles interactions particles often short-ranged can understand effects constraints using geometrical concepts packing geometrical viewpoint gives us window entropy affects structure matter also dynamics forms
