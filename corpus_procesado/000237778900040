long gamma-ray bursts core-collapse supernovae different environments 
massive stars exhaust fuel collapse often produce extraordinarily bright explosions known core-collapse supernovae occasion stellar collapse also powers even brilliant relativistic explosion known long-duration gamma-ray burst one expect long gamma-ray bursts core-collapse supernovae found similar galactic environments show expectation wrong find gamma-ray bursts far concentrated brightest regions host galaxies core-collapse supernovae furthermore host galaxies long gamma-ray bursts significantly fainter irregular hosts core-collapse supernovae together results suggest long-duration gamma-ray bursts associated extremely massive stars may restricted galaxies limited chemical evolution results directly imply long gamma-ray bursts relatively rare galaxies milky way
