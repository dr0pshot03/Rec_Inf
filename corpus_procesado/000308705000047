active dna demethylation plant companion cells reinforces transposon methylation gametes 
arabidopsis thaliana central cell companion cell egg undergoes dna demethylation fertilization targeting preferences mechanism biological significance process remain unclear show active dna demethylation mediated demeter dna glycosylase accounts demethylation central cell preferentially targets small at-rich nucleosome-depleted euchromatic transposable elements vegetative cell companion cell sperm also undergoes demeter-dependent demethylation similar sequences lack demeter vegetative cells causes reduced small rna-directed dna methylation transposons sperm results demonstrate demethylation companion cells reinforces transposon methylation plant gametes likely contributes stable silencing transposable elements across generations
