doubling estimate invertebrate biomass rainforest canopy
forest canopies represent functional interface % earths terrestrial biomass atmosphere include threatened terrestrial ecosystems however lack even basic understanding biomass plants animals distributed throughout forest canopies even though information vital estimating energy flow carbon cycling resource use transfer materials within ecosystem measure biomass invertebrates living common rainforest epiphyte describe striking relationship fern size biomass animals within ferns reveal one large epiphyte may contain invertebrate biomass similar found whole rest tree crown growing using data show including fauna epiphytes-a neglected component rainforest ecosystems-can double estimate total invertebrate biomass entire rainforest canopy
