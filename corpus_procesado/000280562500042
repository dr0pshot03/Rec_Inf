epigenetic silencing engineered l1 retrotransposition events human embryonic carcinoma cells 
long interspersed element line l1 retrotransposition continues affect human genome evolution l1s can retrotranspose germline early development select somatic cells- however host response l1 retrotransposition remains largely unexplored show reporter genes introduced genome various human embryonic carcinoma-derived cell lines ecs l1 retrotransposition rapidly efficiently silenced either immediately integration treating ecs histone deacetylase inhibitors rapidly reverses silencing chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments revealed reactivation reporter gene correlated changes chromatin status l1 integration site assay conditions rapid silencing also observed reporter genes delivered ecs mouse l1s zebrafish line element similar reporter genes delivered ecs moloney murine leukaemia virus human immunodeficiency virus suggesting integration events silenced distinct mechanisms finally demonstrate subjecting ecs culture conditions promote differentiation attenuates silencing reporter genes delivered l1 retrotransposition differentiation sufficient reactivate previously silenced reporter genes thus data indicate ecs differ many differentiated cells ability silence reporter genes delivered l1 retrotransposition
