behavioral ecology breeding together: kin selection mutualism cooperative vertebrates 
`in cooperatively breeding vertebrates nonbreeding helpers raise young produced dominant breeders although evolution cooperative breeding often beenattributed primarily kin selection whereby individuals gain "indirect" benefits fitness assisting collateral relatives increasing evidence helpers can unrelated young raising recent studies also suggest indirect benefits cooperative behavior may often overestimated direct benefits helping helpers fitness probably underestimated now seems likely evolutionary mechanisms maintaining cooperative breeding diverse species direct benefits helping may sufficient maintain cooperative societies benefits cooperation vertebrate societies may consequently show parallels human societies cooperation unrelated individuals frequent social institutions often maintained generalized reciprocity
