seemingly anomalous angular distributions h+d reactive scattering 
hydrogen h atom approaches deuterium d- molecule minimum-energy path three nuclei line consequently nearly collinear collisions cause hd reaction products backscattered low rotational excitation whereas glancing collisions yield sideways-scattered hd products higher rotational excitation report measured cross sections h + d > hdv j + d reaction collision energy electron volts contradict behavior anomalous angular distributions match closely fully quantum mechanical calculations part quasiclassical trajectory calculations energy available product recoil reduced rotational barrier reaction cuts contributions glancing collisions causing high-j hd products become backward scattered
