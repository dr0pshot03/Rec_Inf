predictive fitness model influenza
seasonal human influenza a/h3n2 virus undergoes rapid evolution produces significant year-to-year sequence turnover population circulating strains adaptive mutations respond human immune challenge occur primarily antigenic epitopes antibody-binding domains viral surface protein haemagglutinin develop fitness model haemagglutinin predicts evolution viral population one year next two factors shown determine fitness strain: adaptive epitope changes deleterious mutations outside epitopes infer fitness components strains circulating given year using population-genetic data previous strains fitness frequency strain predict frequency descendent strains following year fitness model maps adaptive history influenza suggests principled method vaccine selection results call comprehensive epidemiology influenza fast-evolving pathogens integrates antigenic phenotypes viral functions coupled genetic linkage
