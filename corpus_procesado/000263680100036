large positive magnetoresistive effect silicon induced space-charge effect
recent discoveries large magnetoresistance non-magnetic semiconductors- gained much attention size effect comparable even larger magnetoresistance magnetic systems- conventional magnetoresistance doped semiconductors straightforwardly explained effect lorentz force carrier motion reported unusually large effects imply underlying mechanisms yet fully explored report simple device based lightly doped silicon substrate two metallic contacts shows large positive magnetoresistance per cent room temperature k per cent k magnetic fields t high electric field applied device conduction space-charge limited- substrates charge carrier density similar cm- magnetoresistance exhibits linear dependence magnetic field t propose observed large magnetoresistance can explained quasi-neutrality breaking space-charge effect insufficient charge present compensate electrons injected device introduces electric field inhomogeneity analogous situation semiconductors large non-saturating magnetoresistance observed- regime motions electrons become correlated thus become dependent magnetic field although large positive magnetoresistance room temperature achieved metal-semiconductor hybrid devices- now realized simpler structure way different known magnetoresistive effects- used develop new magnetic devices silicon may advance silicon technology
