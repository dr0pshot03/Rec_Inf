regulatory t cells increase avidity primary cd8+ t cell responses promote memory
although regulatory t cells t-regs known suppress self-reactive autoimmune responses role t cell responses nonself antigens well understood show t-regs play critical role priming immune responses mice t-reg depletion induced activation expansion population low-avidity cd8+ t cells overproduction ccl-// chemokines stabilized interactions antigen-presenting dendritic cells low-avidity t cells absence t-regs avidity primary immune response impaired resulted reduced memory listeria monocytogenes results suggest t-regs important regulators homeostasis cd8+ t cell priming play critical role induction high-avidity primary responses effective memory
