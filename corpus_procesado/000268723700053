spinal endocannabinoids cb1 receptors mediate c-fiber-induced heterosynaptic pain sensitization 
diminished synaptic inhibition spinal dorsal horn major contributor chronic pain pathways reduce synaptic inhibition inflammatory neuropathic pain states identified central hyperalgesia diminished dorsal horn synaptic inhibition also occur absence inflammation neuropathy solely triggered intense nociceptive c-fiber input spinal dorsal horn found endocannabinoids produced upon strong nociceptive stimulation activated type cannabinoid cb1 receptors inhibitory dorsal horn neurons reduce synaptic release gamma-aminobutyric acid glycine thus rendered nociceptive neurons excitable nonpainful stimuli results suggest spinal endocannabinoids cb1 receptors inhibitory dorsal horn interneurons act mediators heterosynaptic pain sensitization play unexpected role dorsal horn pain-controlling circuits
