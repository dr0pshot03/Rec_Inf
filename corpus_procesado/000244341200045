enantioselective halocyclization polyprenoids induced nucleophilic phosphoramidites 
polycyclic bio-active natural products contain halogen atoms isolated number different marine organisms1 biosynthesis natural products appears initiated electrophilic halogenation reaction carbon carbon double bond2- via mechanism similar proton-induced olefin polycyclization5- enzymes haloperoxidases generate electrophilic halonium ion equivalent reacts terminal carbon carbon double bond polyprenoid enantioselectively inducing cyclization reaction produces halogenated polycyclic terpenoid use enantioselective halocyclization reaction one possible way chemically synthesize halogenated cyclic terpenoids; although several brominated cyclic terpenoids synthesized via diastereoselective halocyclization reaction uses stoichiometric quantities brominating reagent9- enantioselective halocyclization isoprenoids induced chiral promoter yet reported report enantioselective halocyclization simple polyprenoids using nucleophilic promoter achiral nucleophilic phosphorus compounds able promote diastereoselective halocyclization reaction give halogenated cyclic product excellent yields moreover chiral phosphoramidites promote enantioselective halocyclization simple polyprenoids n-iodosuccinimide give iodinated cyclic products % enantiomeric excess diastereomeric excess best knowledge first successful example enantioselective halopolycyclization polyprenoids
