carbonyl sulfide-mediated prebiotic formation peptides
almost discussions prebiotic chemistry assume amino acids nucleotides possibly monomers first formed earth brought comets meteorites condensed nonenzymatically form oligomeric products however attempts demonstrate plausibly prebiotic polymerization reactions met limited success show carbonyl sulfide cos simple volcanic gas brings formation peptides amino acids mild conditions aqueous solution depending reaction conditions additives used exposure alpha-amino acids cos generates peptides yields % minutes hours room temperature
