spontaneous vortices formation bose-einstein condensates
phase transitions ubiquitous nature can arranged universality classes systems unrelated microscopic physics show identical scaling behaviour near critical point one prominent universal element many continuous phase transitions spontaneous formation topological defects quench critical point- microscopic dynamics defect formation transitions generally difficult investigate particularly superfluids- however bose einstein condensates becs offer unique experimental theoretical opportunities probing details present experimental theoretical study bec phase transition trapped atomic gas observe statistically characterize spontaneous formation vortices condensation using microscopic theories- incorporate atomic interactions quantum thermal fluctuations finite-temperature bose gas simulate condensation observe vortex formation close quantitative agreement experimental results studies provide understanding development coherence superfluids may allow direct investigation universal phase transition dynamics
