timing ancestor hiv- pandemic strains 
hiv- sequences analyzed estimate timing ancestral sequence main group hiv- strains responsible aids pandemic using parallel supercomputers assuming constant rate evolution applied maximum-likelihood phylogenetic methods unprecedented amounts data calculation validated approach correctly estimating timing two historically documented points using comprehensive full-length envelope sequence alignment estimated date last common ancestor main group hiv- - analysis gag gene alignment subregions envelope including additional sequences method relaxed assumption strict molecular clock also supported results
