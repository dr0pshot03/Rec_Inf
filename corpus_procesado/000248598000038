jaz family repressors missing link jasmonate signalling 
jasmonates essential phytohormones plant development survival however molecular details signalling pathway remain largely unknown identification decade ago coi1 f-box protein suggested existence repressor jasmonate responses targeted scfcoi1 complex proteasome degradation response jasmonate report identification jasmonate-insensitive jai3 family related proteins named jaz jasmonate zim-domain arabidopsis thaliana results demonstrate jai3 jazs direct targets scfcoi1 e3 ubiquitin ligase jasmonate treatment induces proteasome degradation moreover jai3 negatively regulates key transcriptional activator jasmonate responses myc2 jaz family therefore represents molecular link two previously known steps jasmonate pathway furthermore demonstrate existence regulatory feed-back loop involving myc2 jaz proteins provides mechanistic explanation pulsed response jasmonate subsequent desensitization cell
