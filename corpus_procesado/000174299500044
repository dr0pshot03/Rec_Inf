dependence epsp efficacy synapse location neocortical pyramidal neurons
neurons receive thousands synaptic inputs throughout elaborate dendritic trees determine somatic impact excitatory postsynaptic potentials epsps generated known dendritic sites neocortical pyramidal neurons inputs became distal somatic epsp amplitude decreased whereas use-dependent depression increased despite marked attenuation >-fold coactivated within narrow time window similar to10 milliseconds distal epsps directly influence action potential output following dendritic spike generation findings reveal distal epsps ineffective sources background somatic excitation coincidence detection powerful transient signaling role
