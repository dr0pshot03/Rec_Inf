lipid rafts membrane-organizing principle
cell membranes display tremendous complexity lipids proteins designed perform functions cells require coordinate functions membrane able laterally segregate constituents capability based dynamic liquid-liquid immiscibility underlies raft concept membrane subcompartmentalization lipid rafts fluctuating nanoscale assemblies sphingolipid cholesterol proteins can stabilized coalesce forming platforms function membrane signaling trafficking review evidence principle combines potential sphingolipid-cholesterol self-assembly protein specificity selectively focus membrane bioactivity
