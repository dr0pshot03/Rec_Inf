effects genetic variation gene expression dynamics development
development multicellular organism physiological responses require massive coordinated changes gene expression across several cell tissue types- polymorphic regions genome influence gene expression levels identified expression quantitative trait locus eqtl mapping many species- including loci cell-dependent tissue-dependent age-dependent effects however comprehensive characterization polymorphisms influence complex dynamic patterns gene expression occur development physiology describe efficient experimental design infer gene expression dynamics single expression profiles different genotypes apply characterize effect local cis distant trans genetic variation gene expression high temporal resolution throughout hour period development caenorhabditis elegans taking dynamic variation account identifies >% cis-eqtls including alter dynamics expression period local sequence polymorphisms extensively affect timing rate magnitude shape expression changes indeed many local sequence variants increase decrease gene expression depending time-point profiled expression dynamics hour period also influenced extensively trans distal loci particular several trans loci influence genes quite diverse dynamic expression patterns primarily common time interval trans loci can therefore act modifiers expression particular period development study provides first characterization knowledge effect local distant genetic variation dynamics gene expression throughout extensive time period moreover approach developed facilitate genetic dissection dynamic processes including potentially development physiology disease progression humans
