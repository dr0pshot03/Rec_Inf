correlating structural dynamics function single ribozyme molecules
studied correlation structural dynamics function hairpin ribozyme enzyme-substrate complex exists either docked active undocked inactive conformations using single-molecule fluorescence methods found complex structural dynamics four docked states distinct stabilities strong memory effect molecule rarely switches different docked states also found substrate cleavage rate-limited combination conformational transitions reversible chemistry equilibrium complex structural dynamics quantitatively explain heterogeneous cleavage kinetics common many catalytic rnas intimate coupling structural dynamics function likely general phenomenon rna
