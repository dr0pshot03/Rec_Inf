dust-free quasars early universe
distant quasars known redshifts z approximate generally properties indistinguishable lower-redshift quasars rest-frame ultraviolet/optical x-ray bands- puzzling result suggests distant quasars evolved objects even though universe seven per cent current age redshifts recently one z approximate quasar shown detectable emission hot dust unclear whether indicated different hot-dust properties high redshift simply outlier report discovery second quasar without hot-dust emission sample z approximate quasars apparently hot-dust-free quasars counterparts low redshift moreover demonstrate hot-dust abundance quasars builds tandem growth central black hole whereas low redshift almost independent black hole mass thus z approximate quasars indeed early evolutionary stage rapid mass accretion dust formation two hot-dust-free quasars likely first-generation quasars born dust-free environments young formed detectable amount hot dust around
