mechanosensitive channel msl8 regulates osmotic forces pollen hydration germination
pollen grains undergo dramatic changes cellular water potential deliver male germ line female gametes proposed mechanosensitive ion channels may sense resulting mechanical stress identify characterize mscs-like msl8 pollen-specific membrane tension-gated ion channel required pollen survive hypoosmotic shock rehydration full male fertility msl8 negatively regulates pollen germination required cellular integrity germination tube growth msl8 thus senses responds changes membrane tension associated pollen hydration germination data suggest homologs bacterial mscs repurposed eukaryotes function mechanosensors multiple developmental environmental contexts
