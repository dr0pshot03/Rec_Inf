high-speed force spectroscopy unfolds titin velocity molecular dynamics simulations 
mechanical unfolding muscle protein titin atomic force microscopy landmark understanding single-biomolecule mechanics molecular dynamics simulations offered atomic-level descriptions forced unfolding however experiment simulation directly compared differed pulling velocity orders magnitude developed high-speed force spectroscopy unfold titin velocities reached simulation similar millimeters per second found small beta-strand pair immunoglobulin domain dynamically unfolds refolds buffering pulling forces similar piconewtons distance unfolding transition barrier larger previously estimated better agreement atomistic predictions ability directly compare experiment simulation likely important studies biomechanical processes
