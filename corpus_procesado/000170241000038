biogenic methane hydrogen escape irreversible oxidation early earth 
low o content archean atmosphere implies methane present levels similar parts per million volume ppmv compared ppmv today given plausible biogenic source ch4 favored greenhouse gas countered lower luminosity early sun abundant ch4 implies hydrogen escapes space arrow space orders magnitude faster today reductant loss oxidizes earth photosynthesis splits water o h methanogenesis transfers h ch4 hydrogen escape ch4 photolysis therefore causes net gain oxygen [co2 + 2ho ch4 -> 2o -> co2 + o + 4hup arrow space] expected irreversible oxidation similar moles oxygen per year may help explain earths surface environment became irreversibly oxidized
