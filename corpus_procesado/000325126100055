following gene duplication paralog interference constrains transcriptional circuit evolution 
models gene duplication assume ancestral functions preduplication gene independent can therefore neatly partitioned descendant paralogs however many gene products transcriptional regulators components within cooperative assemblies; show natural consequence duplication divergence proteins can competitive interference paralogs example based duplication essential mads-box transcriptional regulator mcm1 found fungi regulates large set genes show set historical amino acid sequence substitutions minimized paralog interference contemporary species increased molecular complexity gene regulatory network propose paralog interference common constraint gene duplicate evolution resolution can generate additional regulatory complexity needed stabilize duplicated genes genome
