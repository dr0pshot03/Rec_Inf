psychophysics measures relationship stimuluss physical magnitude perceived magnitude decisions based perception stimuli relationship critical understanding decision-making tested whether psychophysical laws explain female tungara frogs physalaemus pustulosus frog-eating bats trachops cirrhosus compare male frog calls imposes selection call evolution although frogs bats prefer elaborate calls less selective call elaboration increases preference based stimulus ratios thus call elaboration increases relative attractiveness relative predation risk decrease receivers perceive compare stimuli data show female cognition can limit evolution sexual signal elaboration
