heterogeneous differentiation patterns individual cd8+ t cells 
upon infection antigen-specific cd8+ t lymphocyte responses display highly reproducible pattern expansion contraction thought reflect uniform behavior individual cells tracked progeny individual mouse cd8+ t cells vivo lineage tracing demonstrated even t cells bearing identical t cell receptors clonal expansion differentiation patterns heterogeneous consequence individual naive t lymphocytes contributed differentially short-and long-term protection revealed participation progeny primary versus recall infections discordance fate individual naive t cells argues asymmetric division singular driver cd8+ t cell heterogeneity demonstrates reproducibility cd8+ t cell responses achieved population averaging
