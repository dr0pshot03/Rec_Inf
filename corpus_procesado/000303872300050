differential diffusivity nodal lefty underlies reaction-diffusion patterning system 
biological systems involving short-range activators long-range inhibitors can generate complex patterns reaction-diffusion models postulate differences signaling range caused differential diffusivity inhibitor activator models suggest differential clearance underlies different signaling ranges test models measured biophysical properties nodal/lefty activator/inhibitor system zebrafish embryogenesis analysis nodal lefty gradients revealed nodals shorter range lefty proteins pulse-labeling analysis indicated nodals leftys similar clearance kinetics whereas fluorescence recovery assays revealed leftys higher effective diffusion coefficient nodals results indicate differential diffusivity major determinant differences nodal/lefty range provide biophysical support reaction-diffusion models activator/inhibitor-mediated patterning
