local flow regulation irrigation raise global human water consumption footprint 
flow regulation irrigation alter local freshwater conditions global effects highly uncertain investigated global effects using hydroclimatic observations large hydrological basins globally find consistent dominant effects increasing relative evapotranspiration activities decreasing temporal runoff variability flow regulation evapotranspiration effect increases long-term average human consumption fresh water +/ km3/year - - increase raises recent estimate current global water footprint humanity around % +/ km3/year results highlight global impact local water-use activities call relevant account earth system modeling
