genetic contribution variation cognitive function: fmri study twins 
little known genetic contribution individual differences neural networks subserving cognition function functional magnetic resonance imaging fmri twin study found significant genetic influence brain activation neural networks supporting digit working memory tasks participants activating frontal-parietal networks responded faster individuals relying language-related brain networks genetic influences brain activation language-relevant brain circuits atypical numerical working memory tasks suggests differences cognition might related brain activation patterns differ qualitatively among individuals
