turbulent convection high rayleigh numbers
turbulent convection occurs rayleigh number ra-which quantifies relative magnitude thermal driving dissipative forces fluid motion-becomes sufficiently high although many theoretical experimental studies turbulent convection exist basic properties heat transport remain unclear one important question concerns existence asymptotic regime supposed occur high ra theory predicts state nusselt number nu representing global heat transport scale nu proportional ra-beta beta / investigate thermal transport eleven orders magnitude rayleigh number less equal ra less equal using cryogenic helium gas working fluid data entire range ra can described lowest order single power-law scaling exponent beta close particular rnd evidence transition ra-/ regime also study variation internal temperature fluctuations ra probe velocity statistics indirectly
