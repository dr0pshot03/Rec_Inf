water catalysis radical-molecule gas-phase reaction
considerable speculation role water water complexes chemical gas-phase reactions including conjecture water may act molecular catalyst ability form hydrogen bonds present kinetic studies effect water rate reaction hydroxyl radicals acetaldehyde measured directly laval nozzle expansions low temperatures increasing enhancement reaction rate added water found decreasing temperatures kelvin quantum chemical calculations statistical rate theory support conclusions observation due reduction intrinsic reaction barrier caused specific water aggregation results suggest even single water molecules can act catalysts radical-molecule reactions
