mitochondrial deubiquitinase usp30 opposes parkin-mediated mitophagy 
cells maintain healthy mitochondria degrading damaged mitochondria mitophagy; defective mitophagy linked parkinsons disease report usp30 deubiquitinase localized mitochondria antagonizes mitophagy driven ubiquitin ligase parkin also known park2 protein kinase pink1 encoded two genes associated parkinsons disease parkin ubiquitinates tags damaged mitochondria clearance overexpression usp removes ubiquitin attached parkin onto damaged mitochondria blocks parkins ability drive mitophagy whereas reducing usp30 activity enhances mitochondrial degradation neurons global ubiquitination site profiling identified multiple mitochondrial substrates oppositely regulated parkin usp30 knockdown usp30 rescues defective mitophagy caused pathogenic mutations parkin improves mitochondrial integrity parkin-or pink1-deficient flies knockdown usp30 dopaminergic neurons protects flies paraquat toxicity vivo ameliorating defects dopamine levels motor function organismal survival thus usp30 inhibition potentially beneficial parkinsons disease promoting mitochondrial clearance quality control
