cenozoic tectonics western north america controlled evolving width farallon slab
subduction oceanic lithosphere occurs two modes: subducting plate motion trench migration using global subduction zone data set three-dimensional numerical subduction models show slab width w controls modes partitioning subduction subducting plate velocity scales w-/ whereas trench velocity scales /w findings explain cenozoic slowdown farallon plate decrease subduction partitioning decreasing slab width change sevier-laramide orogenesis basin range extension north america also explained slab width shortening occurred wide-slab subduction overriding-plate-driven trench retreat whereas extension occurred intermediate narrow-slab subduction slab-driven trench retreat
