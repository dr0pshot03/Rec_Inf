stemness: transcriptional profiling embryonic adult stem cells 
transcriptional profiles mouse embryonic neural hematopoietic stem cells compared de ne genetic program stem cells total genes enriched three types stem cells several genes clustered genome compared differentiated cell types stem cells express significantly higher number genes represented expressed sequence tags whose functions unknown embryonic neural stem cells many similarities transcriptional level results provide foundation detailed understanding stem cell biology
