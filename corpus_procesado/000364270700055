structural insight substrate preference tet mediated oxidation 
dna methylation important epigenetic modification1- ten-eleven translocation tet proteins involved dna demethylation iteratively oxidizing -methylcytosine 5mc -hydroxymethylcytosine 5hmc -formylcytosine 5fc -carboxylcytosine 5cac4- show human tet1 tet2 active 5mc-dna 5hmc/5fc-dna substrates determine crystal structures tet2-5hmc-dna tet2-5fc-dna complexes angstrom angstrom resolution respectively cytosine portion 5hmc/5fc specifically recognized tet2 manner similar 5mc tet2-5mc-dna structure9 pyrimidine base 5mc/5hmc/5fc adopts almost identical conformation within catalytic cavity however hydroxyl group 5hmc carbonyl group 5fc face towards opposite direction hydroxymethyl group 5hmc formyl group 5fc adopt restrained conformations forming hydrogen bonds -carboxylate nog n4 exocyclic nitrogen cytosine respectively biochemical analyses indicate substrate preference tet2 results different efficiencies hydrogen abstraction tet2-mediated oxidation restrained conformation 5hmc 5fc within catalytic cavity may prevent abstractable hydrogens adopting favourable orientation hydrogen abstraction thus result low catalytic efficiency studies demonstrate substrate preference tet2 results intrinsic value substrates 5mc derivative groups suggest 5hmc relatively stable less prone oxidation tet proteins therefore tet proteins evolutionarily tuned less reactive towards 5hmc facilitate generation 5hmc potentially stable mark regulatory functions
