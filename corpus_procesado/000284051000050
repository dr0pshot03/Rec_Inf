pathways drosophila motion vision 
motion vision major function visual systems yet underlying neural mechanisms circuits still elusive lamina first optic neuropile drosophila melanogaster photoreceptor signals split five parallel pathways l1-l5 examine pathways contribute visual motion detection combining genetic block reconstitution neural activity different lamina cell types whole-cell recordings downstream motion-sensitive neurons find reduced responses moving gratings l1 l2 blocked however reconstitution photoreceptor input l1 l2 results wild-type responses thus first experiment indicates necessity pathways whereas second indicates sufficiency single pathway contradiction can explained electrical coupling l1 l2 allowing activation pathways even one receives photoreceptor input fundamental difference l1 pathway l2 pathway uncovered blocking l1 l2 output presenting moving edges positive negative contrast polarity: blocking l1 eliminates response moving edges whereas blocking l2 eliminates response moving edges thus similar segregation photoreceptor signals bipolar cell pathways vertebrate retina photoreceptor signals segregate on-l1 off-l2 channels lamina drosophila
