hoxa2 rhombomere-dependent development mouse facial somatosensory map 
mouse trigeminal pathway sensory inputs distinct facial structures whiskers lower jaw lip topographically mapped onto somatosensory cortex relay stations thalamus hindbrain developing hindbrain mechanisms generating maps remain elusive found principal sensory nucleus whisker-related map contributed rhombomere derived neurons whereas rhombomere derived progeny supply lower jaw lip representation moreover early hoxa2 expression neuroepithelium prevents trigeminal nerve ectopically projecting cerebellum whereas late expression principal sensory nucleus promotes selective arborization whisker-related afferents topographic connectivity thalamus hoxa2 inactivation results absence whisker-related maps postnatal brain thus hoxa2 rhombomere dependent cues determine whisker area map required assembly whisker-to-barrel somatosensory circuit
