mean-field cluster model critical behaviour ferromagnets
two separate theories often used characterize paramagnetic properties ferromagnetic materials temperatures t well curie temperature t-c transition paramagnetic ferromagnetic behaviour occurs classical mean-field theory yields curie-weiss law magnetic susceptibility: chi t proportional /t theta theta weiss constant close t-c however standard mean-field approach breaks better agreement experimental data provided critical scaling theory: chi t proportional /t t-cgamma gamma scaling exponent known model capable predicting measured values g variation among different substances use mean-field cluster model based finite-size thermostatistics extend range mean-field theory thereby eliminating need separate scaling regime mean-field approximation justified using kinetic-energy term maintain microcanonical ensemble model reproduces curie-weiss law high temperatures classical weiss transition t-c theta suppressed finite-size effects instead fraction clusters specific amount order diverges t-c yielding transition mathematically similar bose-einstein condensation temperatures t-c model matches measured magnetic susceptibilities crystalline euo gd co ni thus providing unified picture critical-scaling curie-weiss regimes
