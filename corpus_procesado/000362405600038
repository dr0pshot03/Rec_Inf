structure-function analysis identifies highly sensitive strigolactone receptors striga
strigolactones naturally occurring signaling molecules affect plant development fungi-plant interactions parasitic plant infestations characterized function strigolactone receptors parasitic plant striga hermonthica using chemical structural biology found clade polyspecific receptors including one sensitive picomolar concentrations strigolactone crystal structure highly sensitive strigolactone receptor striga revealed larger binding pocket arabidopsis receptor explain increased range strigolactone sensitivity thus sensitivity striga strigolactones host plants driven receptor sensitivity expressing strigolactone receptors arabidopsis developed bioassay can used identify chemicals crops altered strigolactone levels
