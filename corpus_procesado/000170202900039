growth dynamics pentacene thin films
recent demonstration single-crystal organic optoelectronic devices received widespread attention- practical applications devices require use inexpensive organic films deposited wide variety substrates unfortunately physical properties organic thin films compare favourably single-crystal materials moreover basic physical principles governing organic thin-film growth crystallization well understood report situ study evolution pentacene thin films utilizing real-time imaging capabilities photoelectron emission microscopy combination careful substrate preparation surface energy control succeed growing thin films single-crystal grain sizes approaching millimetre factor larger previously achieved large enough fully contain complete device rnd organic thin-film growth closely mimics epitaxial growth inorganic materials expect strategies concepts developed inorganic systems will provide guidance development optimization molecular thin-film devices
