bypassing kinase activity atp-competitive drug
unfolded proteins endoplasmic reticulum cause trans-autophosphorylation bifunctional transmembrane kinase ire1 induces endoribonuclease activity endoribonuclease initiates nonconventional splicing hac1 messenger rna trigger unfolded-protein response upr explored role ire1s kinase domain sensitizing site-directed mutagenesis atp-competitive inhibitor 1nm-pp1 paradoxically rather inhibited 1nm-pp1 drug-sensitized ire1 mutants required 1nm-pp1 cofactor activation presence 1nm-pp1 drug-sensitized ire1 bypassed mutations inactivate kinase activity induced full upr thus rather phosphorylation per se conformational change kinase domain triggered occupancy active site ligand leads activation known downstream functions
