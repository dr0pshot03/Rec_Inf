chemical etiology nucleic acid structure: alpha-threofuranosyl- -> oligonucleotide system 
tnas [l-alpha threofuranosyl oligonucleotides] containing vicinally connected --> phosphodiester bridges undergo informational base pairing antiparallel strand orientation capable cross-pairing rna dna derived sugar containing four carbons tna structurally simplest potentially natural oligonucleotide-type nucleic acid alternatives studied thus far along base-pairing properties tna warrants close scrutiny system context problem rnas origin
