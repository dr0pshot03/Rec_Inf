lsd1 demethylates repressive histone marks promote androgen-receptor-dependent transcription
gene regulation eukaryotes requires coordinate interaction chromatin-modulating proteins specific transcription factors androgen receptor gene activation repression specifically regulated histone methylation status distinct lysine residues show lysine-specific demethylase lsd1 also known bhc110 co-localizes androgen receptor normal human prostate prostate tumour lsd1 interacts androgen receptor vitro vivo stimulates androgen-receptor-dependent transcription conversely knockdown lsd1 protein levels abrogates androgen-induced transcriptional activation cell proliferation chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses demonstrate androgen receptor lsd1 form chromatin-associated complexes ligand-dependent manner lsd1 relieves repressive histone marks demethylation histone h3 lysine h3-k9 thereby leading de-repression androgen receptor target genes furthermore identify pargyline inhibitor lsd1 pargyline blocks demethylation h3-k9 lsd1 consequently androgen-receptor-dependent transcription thus modulation lsd1 activity offers new strategy regulate androgen receptor functions link demethylation repressive histone mark androgen-receptor-dependent gene activation thus providing mechanism demethylases control specific gene expression
