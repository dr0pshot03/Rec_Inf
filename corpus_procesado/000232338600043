nonlinear dynamics granular media dynamic earthquake triggering
magnitude landers earthquake triggered exceptional number additional earthquakes within california far north yellowstone montana- since observation large earthquakes shown induce dynamic triggering remote distances example magnitude hector mine magnitude denali earthquakes near-field aftershocks physical origin dynamic triggering however remains one least understood aspects earthquake nucleation- dynamic strain amplitudes large earthquake exceedingly small waves propagated several fault radii example strain wave amplitude - wavelength m corresponds displacement amplitude - m show dynamic elastic-nonlinear behaviour fault gouge perturbed seismic wave may trigger earthquakes even small strains base hypothesis recent laboratory dynamic experiments conducted granular media fault gouge surrogate infer fault weak- seismic waves cause fault core modulus decrease abruptly weaken fault already near failure process therefore induce fault slip
