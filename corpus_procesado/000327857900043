giant convection cells found sun
heat transported outermost % suns interior overturning convective motions motions evident suns surface form two characteristic cellular structures: granules supergranules similar similar kilometers across respectively existence much larger cells suggested theory observation years found evidence giant cellular flows persist months tracking motions supergranules expected effects suns rotation flows cells clockwise around high pressure north counterclockwise south transport angular momentum toward equator maintaining suns rapid equatorial rotation
