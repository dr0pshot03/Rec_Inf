guiding folding pathway dna origami
dna origami robust assembly technique folds single-stranded dna template target structure annealing hundreds short staple strands- guiding design principle target structure single stable configuration folding transition cooperative case proteins governed information encoded polymer sequence- typical origami folds primarily desired shape misfolded structures can kinetically trap system reduce yield although adjusting assembly conditions following empirical design rules can improve yield well-folded origami often need separated misfolded structures- problem principle avoided assembly pathway kinetics fully understood rationally optimized end present dna origami system unusual property able form small set distinguishable well-folded shapes represent discrete approximately degenerate energy minima vast folding landscape thus allowing us probe assembly process obtained high yield well-folded origami structures confirms existence efficient folding pathways shape distribution provides information individual trajectories folding landscape find similarly protein folding assembly dna origami highly cooperative reversible bond formation important recovering transient misfoldings early formation long-range connections can effectively enforce particular folds use insights inform design system steer assembly towards desired structures expanding rational design process include assembly pathway thus enable reproducible synthesis particularly targeting complex structures anticipate expansion will essential dna origami continue rapid development-- become reliable manufacturing technology
