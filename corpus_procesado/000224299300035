quantum fluid metallic hydrogen suggested first-principles calculations 
generally assumed- solid hydrogen will transform metallic alkali-like crystal sufficiently high pressure however theoretical models also suggested compressed hydrogen may form unusual two-component protons electrons metallic fluid low temperature possibly even zero-temperature liquid ground state existence new states matter conditional presence maximum melting temperature versus pressure curve melt line previous measurements- hydrogen melt line pressures gpa led controversial conclusions regarding existence maximum report ab initio calculations establish melt line gpa predict subtle changes intermolecular interactions lead decline melt line gpa implication solid molecular hydrogen compressed transforms low-temperature quantum fluid becoming monatomic crystal emerging low-temperature phase diagram hydrogen isotopes bears analogies familiar phases known zero-temperature liquids long-range coulomb interactions large component mass ratio present hydrogen result dramatically different properties
