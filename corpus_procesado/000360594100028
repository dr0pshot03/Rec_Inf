negative refractive index acoustic superlens multiple scattering single negative metamaterials
metamaterials man-made composite media structured scale much smaller wavelength offer surprising possibilities engineering propagation waves- one interesting ability achieve superlensing-that focus image beyond diffraction limit originates left-handed behaviour-the property refracting waves negatively-that typical negative index metamaterials- yet reaching goal requires design double negative metamaterials act simultaneously permittivity permeability electromagnetics density compressibility acoustics generally implies use two different kinds building blocks specific particles presenting multiple overlapping resonances- requirement limits applicability double negative metamaterials example hampered demonstration subwavelength focusing using left-handed acoustic metamaterials show strict conditions can largely relaxed relying media consist one type single resonant unit cell specifically show simple yet general semi-analytical model judiciously breaking symmetry single negative metamaterial sufficient turn double negative one demonstrate occurs solely multiple scattering waves metamaterial resonant elements phenomenon often disregarded media owing subwavelength patterning apply approach acoustics verify numerical simulations allows realization negative index acoustic metamaterials based helmholtz resonators finally demonstrate operation negative index acoustic superlens achieving subwavelength focusing imaging spot width resolution times better diffraction limit respectively findings profound implications physics metamaterials highlighting role subwavelength crystalline structure hence entering realm metamaterial crystals widens scope possibilities designing composite media novel properties much simpler way possible far
