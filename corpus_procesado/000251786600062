rapid changes throughput single motor cortex neurons muscle activity
motor cortex output capable considerable reorganization involves modulation excitability within cortex reorganization also involve changes beyond cortex level throughput single motor cortex neurons muscle activity examined throughput paradigm provided incentive enhancing functional connectivity motor cortex neurons muscles short latency throughput recorded neuron muscle activity present behavioral epochs often appeared others changes throughput always attributed higher neuron firing rate ongoing muscle activity neuronal synchronization indicating reorganization motor cortex output may involve rapid changes functional connectivity single motor cortex neurons alpha-motoneuron pools
