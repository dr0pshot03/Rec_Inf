entangled states atoms optical fiber cavity
multiparticle entanglement enables quantum simulations quantum computing quantum-enhanced metrology yet methods produce measure entanglement maintaining single-qubit resolution number qubits scaled using atom chips fiber-optical cavities developed method based nondestructive collective measurement conditional evolution create symmetric entangled states perform tomography demonstrate creation analysis entangled states mean atom numbers experimentally prove multiparticle entanglement method independent atom number allow generalization entangled states physical implementations including circuit quantum electrodynamics
