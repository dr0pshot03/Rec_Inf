splicing factors facilitate rnai-directed silencing fission yeast 
heterochromatin formation fission yeast centromeres directed rna interference rnai noncoding transcripts derived centromeric repeats processed small interfering rnas sirnas direct rna-induced transcriptional silencing rits effector complex engage centromer transcripts resulting recruitment histone h3 lysine methyltransferase clr4 hence silencing found defects specific splicing factors splicing affect generation centromeric sirnas consequently centromeric heterochromatin integrity moreover splicing factors physically associate cid12 component rnai machinery centromeric chromatin consistent direct role rnai propose spliceosomal complexes provide platform sirna generation hence facilitate effective centromere repeat silencing
