self-organized vortex array hydrodynamically entrained sperm cells
many patterns biological systems depend exchange chemical signals cells report spatiotemporal pattern mediated hydrodynamic interactions planar surfaces spermatozoa self-organized dynamic vortices resembling quantized rotating waves vortices formed array local hexagonal order introducing order parameter quantifies cooperativity found array appeared critical sperm density using model estimated hydrodynamic interaction force spermatozoa similar piconewtons thus large-scale coordination cells can regulated hydrodynamically chemical signals required
