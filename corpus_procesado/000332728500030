specific nonhepatotoxic degradation nuclear hepatitis b virus cccdna 
current antiviral agents can control eliminate hepatitis b virus hbv hbv establishes stable nuclear covatently closed circular dna cccdna interferon-alpha treatment can clear hbv limited systemic side effects describe interferon-alpha can induce specific degradation nuclear viral dna without hepatotoxicity propose lymphotoxin-beta receptor activation therapeutic alternative interferon-alpha lymphotoxin-beta receptor activation up-regulated apobec3a apobec3b cytidine deaminases respectively hbv-infected cells primary hepatocytes human liver needle biopsies hbv core protein mediated interaction nuclear cccdna resulting cytidine deamination apurinic/apyrimidinic site formation finally cccdna degradation prevented hbv reactivation genomic dna affected thus inducing nuclear deaminases-for example lymphotoxin-beta receptor activation-allows development new therapeutics combination existing antivirals may cure hepatitis b
