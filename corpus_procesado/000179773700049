evidence antibody-catalyzed ozone formation bacterial killing inflammation
recently showed antibodies catalyze generation hydrogen peroxide h2o2 singlet molecular oxygen o-* water show process can lead efficient killing bacteria regardless antigen specificity antibody h2o2 production antibodies alone found sufficient bacterial killing studies suggested antibody-catalyzed water-oxidation pathway produced additional molecular species chemical signature similar ozone species also generated oxidative burst activated human neutrophils inflammation observations suggest alternative pathways may exist biological killing bacteria mediated potent oxidants previously unknown biology
