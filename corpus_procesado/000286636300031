persistent oxygen anomaly reveals fate spilled methane deep gulf mexico
methane abundant hydrocarbon released deepwater horizon oil spill gulf mexico beyond relevancy anthropogenic event methane release simulates rapid relatively short-term natural release hydrates deep water based methane oxygen distributions measured stations throughout affected region find within similar days onset release similar x x moles oxygen respired primarily methanotrophs left behind residual microbial community containing methanotrophic bacteria suggest vigorous deepwater bacterial bloom respired nearly released methane within time analogy large-scale releases methane hydrate deep ocean likely met similarly rapid methanotrophic response
