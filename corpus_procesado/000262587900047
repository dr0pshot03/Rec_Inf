widespread increase tree mortality rates western united states
persistent changes tree mortality rates can alter forest structure composition ecosystem services carbon sequestration analyses longitudinal data unmanaged old forests western united states showed background noncatastrophic mortality rates increased rapidly recent decades doubling periods ranging years among regions increases also pervasive across elevations tree sizes dominant genera past fire histories forest density basal area declined slightly suggests increasing mortality caused endogenous increases competition mortality increased small trees overall increase mortality rates attributed solely aging large trees regional warming consequent increases water deficits likely contributors increases tree mortality rates
