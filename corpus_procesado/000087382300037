accretion primitive planetesimals: hf-w isotopic evidence enstatite chondrites
enstatite chondrites often considered closely related material earth accreted however tungsten isotopic data reveal clear differences moreover silicate metal fractions define distinct initial h-/hf corresponding +/ million year apparent age difference internal reequilibration provide ready explanation result larger scale redistribution tungsten likely may occurred collisions planetesimals
