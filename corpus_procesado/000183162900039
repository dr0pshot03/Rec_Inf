selectivity vibrationally mediated single-molecule chemistry
selective excitation molecular vibrations provides means directly influence speed outcome chemical reactions mode-selective chemistry traditionally used laser pulses prepare reactants specific vibrational states enhance reactivity modify distribution product species inelastic tunnelling electrons may also excite molecular vibrations used effect adsorbed molecules cleave individual chemical bonds induce molecular motion- dissociation- demonstrate inelastic tunnelling electrons can tuned induce selectively either translation desorption individual ammonia molecules cu surface able select particular reaction pathway adjusting electronic tunnelling current energy reaction induction activate either stretching vibration ammonia inversion pyramidal structure results illustrate ability scanning tunnelling microscope probe single-molecule events limit low yield low power irradiation allow investigation reaction pathways readily amenable study conventional approaches
