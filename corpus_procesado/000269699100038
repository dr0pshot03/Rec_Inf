tuned transposition: molecular determinants underlying hyperactivity stowaway mite
miniature inverted repeat transposable elements mites widespread eukaryotic genomes can attain high copy numbers despite lack coding capacity however little known originate amplify performed genome-wide screen functional interactions stowaway mites potential transposases rice genome identified transpositionally active mite possesses key properties enhance transposition although directly related autonomous element mite less affinity transposase autonomous element lacks motif repressing transposition autonomous element mite contains internal sequences enhance transposition findings suggest mites achieve high transposition activity scavenging transposases encoded distantly related self-restrained autonomous elements
