magma-compensated crustal thinning continental rift zones
continental rift zones long narrow tectonic depressions earths surface entire lithosphere modified extension rifting can eventually lead rupture continental lithosphere creation new oceanic lithosphere alternatively lead formation wide sedimentary basins around failed rift zones conventional models rift zones include three characteristic features: surface manifestation elongated topographic trough moho shallowing due crustal thinning reduced seismic velocity uppermost mantle due decompression melting heating earths interior- demonstrate surface manifestation observed baikal rift zone whereas crustal mantle characteristics can ruled new seismic profile across southern lake baikal siberia instead observe localized zone lower crust exceptionally high seismic velocity highly reflective suggest expected moho uplift compensated magmatic intrusion lower crust producing observed high velocity zone finding demonstrates previously unknown role magmatism rifting processes significant implications estimation stretching factors modelling sedimentary basins around failed rift structures
