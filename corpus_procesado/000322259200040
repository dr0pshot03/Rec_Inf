mtorc1 phosphorylation sites encode sensitivity starvation rapamycin
mechanistic target rapamycin mtor complex mtorc1 protein kinase promotes growth target rapamycin clinically useful drug also prolongs life span model organisms persistent mystery phosphorylation many bona fide mtorc1 substrates resistant rapamycin find vitro kinase activity mtorc1 toward peptides encompassing established phosphorylation sites varies widely correlates strongly resistance sites rapamycin well nutrient growth factor starvation within cells slight modifications sites sufficient alter mtorc1 activity toward vitro cause concomitant changes within cells sensitivity rapamycin starvation thus intrinsic capacity phosphorylation site serve mtorc1 substrate property call substrate quality major determinant sensitivity modulators pathway results reveal mechanism mtorc1 effectors can respond differentially signals
