fitness trade-offs environmentally induced mutation buffering isogenic c elegans
mutations often consequences vary across individuals show stimulation stress response can reduce mutation penetrance caenorhabditis elegans moreover induced mutation buffering varies across isogenic individuals interindividual differences stress signaling variation important consequences wild-type animals producing individuals higher stress resistance lower reproductive fitness individuals lower stress resistance higher reproductive fitness may beneficial unpredictable environment acting bet-hedging strategy diversify risk results illustrate transient environmental stimuli can induce protection mutations environmental responses can underlie variable mutation buffering fitness trade-off may make variation stress signaling advantageous
