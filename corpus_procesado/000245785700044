ubiquitination anaphase-promoting complex drives spindle checkpoint inactivation
eukaryotic cells rely surveillance mechanism known spindle checkpoint ensure accurate chromosome segregation spindle checkpoint prevents sister chromatids separating kinetochores achieve bipolar attachments mitotic spindle- checkpoint proteins tightly inhibit anaphase-promoting complex apc ubiquitin ligase required chromosome segregation progression anaphase unattached kinetochores promote binding checkpoint proteins mad2 bubr1 apc-activator cdc20 rendering unable activate apc kinetochores properly attached however cells inactivate checkpoint within minutes allowing rapid synchronous segregation chromosomes cells switch strong apc inhibition kinetochore attachment rapid apc activation attachment complete remains mystery show checkpoint inactivation energy-consuming process involving apc-dependent multi-ubiquitination multi-ubiquitination apc leads dissociation mad2 bubr1 cdc20 process reversed cdc20-directed de-ubiquitinating enzyme mutual regulation checkpoint proteins apc leaves cell poised rapid checkpoint inactivation ensures chromosome segregation promptly follows completion kinetochore attachment addition results suggest mechanistic basis cancer cells can compromised spindle checkpoint without corresponding mutations checkpoint genes
