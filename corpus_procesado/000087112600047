suppressing wall turbulence means transverse traveling wave 
direct numerical simulations wall-bounded flow reveal turbulence production can suppressed transverse traveling wave flow visualizations show near-wall streaks eliminated contrast turbulence-control techniques leading large shear stress reduction traveling wave can induced spanwise force confined within viscous sublayer; maximum wall decays exponentially away demonstrate application approach salt water using arrays electromagnetic tiles produce required traveling wave excitation high efficiency
