ohms law survives atomic scale
silicon electronics approaches atomic scale interconnects circuitry become comparable size active device components maintaining low electrical resistivity scale challenging presence confining surfaces interfaces report fabrication wires silicon-only one atom tall four atoms wide-with exceptionally low resistivity similar milliohm-centimeters current-carrying capabilities copper embedding phosphorus atoms within silicon crystal average spacing less nanometer achieved diameter-independent resistivity demonstrates ohmic scaling atomic limit atomistic tight-binding calculations confirm metallicity atomic-scale wires pave way single-atom device architectures classical quantum information processing
