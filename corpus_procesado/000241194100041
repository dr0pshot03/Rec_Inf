tissue geometry determines sites mammary branching morphogenesis organotypic cultures
treelike structures many organs including mammary gland generated branching morphogenesis reiterative process branch initiation invasion preexisting epithelium using micropatterning approach control initial three-dimensional structure mouse mammary epithelial tubules culture combined algorithm quantify extent branching found geometry tubules dictates position branches predicted numerically confirm experimentally branches initiate sites local minimum concentration autocrine inhibitory morphogens transforming growth factor beta results reveal tissue geometry can control organ morphogenesis defining local cellular microenvironment finding relevance control invasion metastasis
