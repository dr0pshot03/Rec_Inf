compact sources origin soft gamma-ray emission milky way 
milky way known abundant source gamma-ray photons now determined mainly diffuse nature resulting interstellar processes soft gamma-ray domain point sources expected dominate lack sensitive high-resolution observations allow clear estimate contribution sources even best imaging experiment revealed point sources accounting % total galactic flux theoretical studies unable explain remaining intense diffuse emission investigating origin soft gamma-rays therefore necessary determine dominant particle acceleration processes gain insights physical chemical equilibrium interstellar medium report observations soft gamma-ray domain reveal numerous compact sources show sources account entirety milky ways emission soft gamma-rays leaving minor role diffuse processes
