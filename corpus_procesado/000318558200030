hypothalamic programming systemic ageing involving ikk-beta nf-kappa b gnrh
ageing result gradual overall functional deteriorations across body however unknown whether individual tissue primarily works mediate ageing progress control lifespan show hypothalamus important development whole-body ageing mice underlying basis involves hypothalamic immunity mediated kappa b kinase-beta ikk-beta nuclear factor kappa b nf-kappa b related microglianeuron immune crosstalk several interventional models developed showing ageing retardation lifespan extension achieved mice preventing ageing-related hypothalamic brain ikk-beta nf-kappa b activation mechanistic studies revealed ikk-beta nf-kappa b inhibit gonadotropin-releasing hormone gnrh mediate ageing-related hypothalamic gnrh decline gnrh treatment amends ageing-impaired neurogenesis decelerates ageing conclusion hypothalamus programmatic role ageing development via immune-neuroendocrine integration immune inhibition gnrh restoration hypothalamus/brain represent two potential strategies optimizing lifespan combating ageing-related health problems
