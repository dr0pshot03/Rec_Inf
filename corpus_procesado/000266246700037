greater transportation energy ghg offsets bioelectricity ethanol
quantity land available grow biofuel crops without affecting food prices greenhouse gas ghg emissions land conversion limited therefore bioenergy maximize land-use efficiency addressing transportation climate change goals biomass power either internal combustion electric vehicles relative land-use efficiency two energy pathways well quantified show bioelectricity outperforms ethanol across range feedstocks conversion technologies vehicle classes bioelectricity produces average % transportation kilometers % emissions offsets per unit area cropland cellulosic ethanol results suggest alternative bioenergy pathways large differences efficiently use available land achieve transportation climate goals
