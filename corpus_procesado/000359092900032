abrupt warming events drove late pleistocene holarctic megafaunal turnover 
mechanisms late pleistocene megafauna extinctions remain fiercely contested human impact climate change cited principal drivers compared ancient dna radiocarbon data detailed time series regional megafaunal extinctions replacements past years standard new combined records northern hemisphere climate late pleistocene unexpectedly rapid climate changes associated interstadial warming events strongly associated regional replacement extinction major genetic clades species megafauna presence many cryptic biotic transitions pleistocene/holocene boundary revealed ancient dna confirms importance climate change megafaunal population extinctions suggests metapopulation structures necessary survive repeated rapid climatic shifts susceptible human impacts
