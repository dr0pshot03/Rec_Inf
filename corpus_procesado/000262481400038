dynamics time scale ongoing genomic erosion symbiotic bacteria 
among cellular organisms symbiotic bacteria provide extreme examples genome degradation reduction however isolated snapshots eroding symbiont genomes previously available documented dynamics symbiont genome evolution sequencing seven strains buchnera aphidicola pea aphid hosts estimated spontaneous mutation rate least x - substitutions per site per replication times high rates previously estimated bacteria observed high rate small insertions deletions associated abundant dna homopolymers occasional larger deletions although purifying selection eliminates many mutations persist resulting ongoing loss genes dna already tiny genome results provide general model stepwise process leading genome reduction
