evolution selfing arabidopsis thaliana 
unlike close relatives arabidopsis thaliana capable self-pollination members mustard family outcrossing ensured complex self-incompatibility s locus harbors multiple diverged specificity haplotypes effectively prevent selfing investigated role s locus evolution transition selfing thaliana found s locus thaliana harbored considerable diversity apparent remnant polymorphism outcrossing ancestor thus fixation single inactivated s-locus allele key step transition selfing analysis genome-wide pattern linkage disequilibrium suggests selfing likely evolved roughly million years ago
