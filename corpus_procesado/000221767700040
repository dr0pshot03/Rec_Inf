drosophila dfoxo controls lifespan regulates insulin signalling brain fat body 
drosophila melanogaster ageing slowed insulin-like signalling reduced: life expectancy extended % insulin-like receptor inr receptor substrate chico mutated insulin-producing cells ablated- yet resolve insulin affects ageing whether insulin signals regulate ageing directly indirectly secondary hormones caenorhabditis elegans lifespan also extended insulin signalling inhibited certain tissues repressed adult worms requires forkhead transcription factor foxo encoded daf ref d melanogaster insulin-like receptor mediates phosphorylation dfoxo equivalent nematode daf mammalian foxo3a demonstrate dfoxo regulates d melanogaster ageing activated adult pericerebral fat body show limited activation dfoxo reduces expression drosophila insulin-like peptide dilp synthesized neurons represses endogenous insulin-dependent signalling peripheral fat body findings suggest autonomous non-autonomous roles insulin signalling combine control ageing
