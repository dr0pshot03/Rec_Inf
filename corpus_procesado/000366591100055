synthesis borophenes: anisotropic two-dimensional boron polymorphs 
atomic-cluster scale pure boron markedly similar carbon forming simple planar molecules cage-like fullerenes theoretical studies predict two-dimensional 2d boron sheets will adopt atomic configuration similar boron atomic clusters synthesized atomically thin crystalline 2d boron sheets ie borophene silver surfaces ultrahigh-vacuum conditions atomic-scale characterization supported theoretical calculations revealed structures reminiscent fused boron clusters multiple scales anisotropic out-of-plane buckling unlike bulk boron allotropes borophene shows metallic characteristics consistent predictions highly anisotropic 2d metal
