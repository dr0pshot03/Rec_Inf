coding/decoding reversibility droplet trains microfluidic networks
droplets one liquid suspended second immiscible liquid move microfluidic device channel splits two branches reconnect downstream droplets choose path based number droplets occupy branch interaction among droplets channels results complex sequences path selection linearity flow microchannels however ensures behavior system can reversed reversibility makes possible encrypt decrypt signals coded intervals droplets encoding/decoding device functional microfluidic system requires droplets navigate network precise manner without use valves switches means external control
