pulsars binary systems: probing binary stellar evolution general relativity 
radio pulsars binary orbits often short millisecond spin periods result mass transfer companion stars therefore act precise stable moving clocks allow us investigate large set otherwise inaccessible astrophysical problems orbital parameters derived high-precision binary pulsar timing provide constraints binary evolution characteristics binary pulsar population masses neutron stars different mass-transfer histories binary systems also test gravitational theories setting strong limits deviations general relativity surveys new pulsars yield new binary systems increase understanding fields may open whole new areas physics spectacularly evidenced recent discovery extremely relativistic double-pulsar system
