retrograde semaphorin signaling regulates synapse elimination developing mouse brain
neural circuits shaped elimination early-formed redundant synapses postnatal development retrograde signaling postsynaptic cells regulates synapse elimination work identified semaphorins family versatile cell recognition molecules retrograde signals elimination redundant climbing fiber purkinje cell synapses developing mouse cerebellum knockdown sema3a secreted semaphorin purkinje cells receptor climbing fibers accelerated synapse elimination postnatal day p8 p18 conversely knockdown sema7a membrane-anchored semaphorin purkinje cells either two receptors climbing fibers impaired synapse elimination p15 effect sema7a involves signaling metabotropic glutamate receptor canonical pathway climbing fiber synapse elimination findings define semaphorins retrogradely regulate multiple processes synapse elimination
