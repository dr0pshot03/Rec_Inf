binding human prp31 nop domain composite rna-protein platform u4 snrnp 
although highly homologous spliceosomal hprp31 nucleolar nop56 nop58 nop56/ proteins recognize different ribonucleoprotein rnp particles hprp31 interacts complexes containing 5k protein u4 u4atac small nuclear rna snrna whereas nop56/ associate 5k-box c/d small nucleolar rna complexes present structural biochemical analyses hprp31-5k-u4 snrna complexes show conserved nop domain hprp31 maintains high rnp binding selectivity despite relaxed rna sequence requirements nop domain genuine rnp binding module exhibiting rna protein binding surfaces yeast two-hybrid analyses suggest link retinitis pigmentosa aberrant hprp31-hprp6 interaction blocks u4/u6-u5 tri-snrnp formation
