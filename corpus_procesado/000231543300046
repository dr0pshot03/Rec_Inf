toll-like receptor mediated reversal cd4+ regulatory t cell function
cd4+ regulatory t treg cells profound ability suppress host immune responses yet little understood cells regulated describe mechanism [inking toll-like receptor tlr signaling control treg cell function synthetic natural ligands human tlr8 can reverse treg cell function effect independent dendritic cells required functional tlr8-myd88-irak4 signaling treg cells adoptive transfer tlr8 ligand-stimulated treg cells tumor-bearing mice enhanced antitumor immunity results suggest tlr8 signaling play critical role controlling immune responses cancer diseases
