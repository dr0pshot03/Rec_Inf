honey bee nest thermoregulation: diversity promotes stability
honey bee colony characterized high genetic diversity among workers generated high levels multiple mating queen clear benefits genetic diversity known show brood nest temperatures genetically diverse colonies ie sired several males tend stable genetically uniform ones ie sired one male one reason increased stability arises genetically determined diversity workers temperature response thresholds modulates hive-ventilating behavior individual workers preventing excessive colony-level responses temperature fluctuations
