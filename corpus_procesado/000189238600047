carbon nitrogen isotopic anomalies anhydrous interplanetary dust particle 
hydrogen nitrogen isotopic anomalies interplanetary dust particles associated carbonaceous material lack similar anomalies carbon major conundrum report presence c- depletion associated n- enrichment anhydrous interplanetary dust particle observations suggest anomalies carried heteroatomic organic compounds theoretical models indicate low-temperature formation organic compounds cold interstellar molecular clouds can produce carbon nitrogen fractionations remains seen whether specific effects observed can reproduced
