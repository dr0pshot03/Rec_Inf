triple vortex ring structure superfluid helium ii
superfluids helium ii consist two interpenetrating fluids: normal fluid superfluid helium ii vortex ring generally considered merely superfluid object neglecting associated motion normal fluid report three-dimensional calculation coupled motion normal-fluid superfluid components shows helium ii vortex ring consists superfluid vortex ring accompanied two coaxial normal-fluid vortex rings opposite polarity three vortex rings form coherent dissipative structure
