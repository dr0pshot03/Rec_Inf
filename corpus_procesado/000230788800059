host shift invasive plant triggers rapid animal hybrid speciation 
speciation animals almost always envisioned split existing lineage ancestral derived species alternative speciation route homoploid hybrid speciation two ancestral taxa give rise third derived species hybridization without change chromosome number although theoretically possible regarded rare hence little importance animals basis molecular chromosomal evidence hybridization best explanation origin handful extant diploid bisexual animal taxa- report first case hybridization two host-specific animals tephritid fruitflies clearly associated shift new resource hybrid host shift presents ecologically robust scenario animal hybrid speciation offers potential mechanism reproductive isolation differential adaptation new ecological niche necessary conditions mechanism speciation common parasitic animals represent much animal diversity frequency homoploid hybrid speciation animals may therefore higher previously assumed
