seismic identification along-axis hydrothermal flow east pacific rise 
hydrothermal circulation axis mid ocean ridges affects chemistry lithosphere overlying ocean supports chemosynthetic biological communities responsible significant heat transfer lithosphere ocean- commonly thought flow systems oriented across ridge axis recharge occurring along axis faults- structure scale hydrothermal systems usually inferred thermal geochemical models constrained geophysical setting- rather direct observations presence microearthquakes may shed light hydrothermal pathways revealing zones thermal cracking cold sea water extracts heat hot crustal rocks well regions magmatic tectonic stresses create fractures increase porosity permeability show hypocentres beneath well studied hydrothermal vent field east pacific rise cluster vertical pipe like zone near small axial discontinuity band lies directly axial magma chamber location shallow pipe like cluster relative distribution temperature hydrothermal vents along section ridge suggests hydrothermal recharge may concentrated consequence permeability generated tectonic fracturing furthermore interpret band seismicity magma chamber zone hydrothermal cracking suggests hydrothermal circulation may strongly aligned along ridge axis conclude models suggest hydrothermal cells oriented across axis diffuse axis recharge zones may apply fast spreading east pacific rise
