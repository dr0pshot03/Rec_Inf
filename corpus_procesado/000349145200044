refining deep brain stimulation emulate optogenetic treatment synaptic pathology 
circuit remodeling driven pathological forms synaptic plasticity underlies several psychiatric diseases including addiction deep brain stimulation dbs applied treat number neurological psychiatric conditions although effects transient mediated largely unknown mechanisms recently optogenetic protocols restore normal transmission identified synapses mice provided proof idea cocaine-adaptive behavior can reversed vivo efficient protocol relies activation metabotropic glutamate receptors mglurs depotentiates excitatory synaptic inputs onto dopamine d1 receptor medium-sized spiny neurons normalizes drug-adaptive behavior discovered acute low-frequency dbs refined selective blockade dopamine d1 receptors mimics optogenetic mglur-dependent normalization synaptic transmission consequently long-lasting abolishment behavioral sensitization
