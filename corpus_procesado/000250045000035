tumour invasion metastasis initiated microrna 10b breast cancer 
micrornas implicated regulating diverse cellular pathways although emerging evidence micrornas can function oncogenes tumour suppressors role micrornas mediating cancer metastasis remains unexplored show using combination mouse human cells microrna-10b mir-10b highly expressed metastatic breast cancer cells positively regulates cell migration invasion overexpression mir-10b otherwise non-metastatic breast tumours initiates robust invasion metastasis expression mir-10b induced transcription factor twist binds directly putative promoter mir-10b mirn10b mir-10b induced twist proceeds inhibit translation messenger rna encoding homeobox d10 resulting increased expression well-characterized pro-metastatic gene rhoc significantly level mir-10b expression primary breast carcinomas correlates clinical progression findings suggest workings undescribed regulatory pathway pleiotropic transcription factor induces expression specific microrna suppresses direct target turn activates another pro-metastatic gene leading tumour cell invasion metastasis
