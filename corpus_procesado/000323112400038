epithelial junctions maintain tissue architecture directing planar spindle orientation
epithelial cell proliferation planar alignment mitotic spindle coordinates local process symmetric cell cleavage global maintenance polarized tissue architecture although disruption planar spindle alignment proposed cause epithelial mesenchymal transition cancer- vivo mechanisms regulating mitotic spindle orientation remain elusive demonstrate actomyosin cortex junction-localized neoplastic tumour suppressors scribbled discs large essential roles planar spindle alignment thus control epithelial integrity drosophila imaginal disc show defective alignment mitotic spindle correlates cell delamination apoptotic death blocking death misaligned cells sufficient drive formation basally localized tumour-like masses findings indicate key role junction-mediated spindle alignment maintenance epithelial integrity also reveal previously unknown cell-death-mediated tumour-suppressor function inherent polarized architecture epithelia
