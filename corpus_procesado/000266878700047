extensive demethylation repetitive elements seed development underlies gene imprinting
dna methylation epigenetic mark associated transposable element silencing gene imprinting flowering plants mammals plants imprinting occurs endosperm nourishes embryo seed development profiled arabidopsis dna methylation genome-wide embryo endosperm found large-scale methylation changes accompany endosperm development endosperm-specific gene expression transposable element fragments extensively demethylated endosperm discovered new imprinted genes identification candidates associated regions reduced endosperm methylation preferential expression endosperm relative parts plant data suggest imprinting plants evolved targeted methylation transposable element insertions near genic regulatory elements followed positive selection resulting expression change advantageous
