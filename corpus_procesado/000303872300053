meiosis-specific noncoding rna mediates robust pairing homologous chromosomes meiosis
pairing recombination homologous chromosomes essential ensuring reductional segregation meiosis however mechanisms chromosomes recognize homologous partners poorly understood report sme2 gene encodes meiosis-specific noncoding rna mediates homologous recognition fission yeast schizosaccharomyces pombe sme2 locus shows robust pairing early meiotic prophase sme2 rna transcripts accumulate respective gene loci greatly enhance pairing homologous loci: deletion sme2 sequence eliminates robust pairing whereas transposition chromosomal sites confers robust pairing ectopic sites thus propose rna transcripts retained chromosome play active role recognition homologous chromosomes pairing
