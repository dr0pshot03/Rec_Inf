all-metallic three-dimensional photonic crystals large infrared bandgap 
three-dimensional 3d metallic crystals promising photonic bandgap- structures: can possess large bandgap- new electromagnetic phenomena can explored- high-temperature degreesc applications may possible however investigation photonic bandgap properties challenging especially infrared visible spectrum metals dispersive absorbing regions studies metallic photonic crystals therefore mainly concentrated microwave millimetre wavelengths difficulties fabricating 3d metallic crystals present another challenge although emerging techniques self-assembly may help resolve problems report measurements simulations 3d tungsten crystal large photonic bandgap infrared wavelengths mum strong attenuation exists bandgap similar to30 db per unit cell mum structures also possess interesting optical properties sharp absorption peak present photonic band edge surprisingly large transmission observed allowed band mum propose 3d metallic photonic crystals can used integrate various photonic transport phenomena allowing applications thermophotovoltaics blackbody emission
