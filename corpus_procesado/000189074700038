fragmentation massive star formation
studies evolved massive stars indicate form clustered mode earliest evolutionary stages regions embedded within natal cores present high-spatial-resolution interferometric dust continuum observations disentangling cluster-like structure young massive star-forming region derived protocluster mass distribution consistent stellar initial mass function thus fragmentation initial massive cores may determine initial mass function masses final stars implies stars masses can form via accretion processes coalescence intermediate-mass protostars appears necessary
