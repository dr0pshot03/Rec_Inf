absolute configuration chirally deuterated neopentane
relationship macroscopic chirality chirality molecular level unequivocally established anomalous x-ray scattering although technique became definitive method determining absolute configuration molecule one important limitation approach molecule must contain heavy atoms example bromine direct determination absolute configurations wider range molecules recently become possible measuring molecules vibrational optical activity show instrumental advances raman optical activity combined quantum chemical computations- make possible determine absolute configuration r-[h- h- h-]-neopentane saturated hydrocarbon represents archetype molecules chiral result dissymmetric mass distribution chemically inert derivatized yield molecules reveal absolute configuration parent compound diastereomeric interactions molecules optical rotation electronic circular dichroism contrast well-known case bromochlorofluoromethane- expected measurable vibronic effects vacuum ultraviolet circular dichroism might reveal molecule chiral presence nine rotamers make extremely difficult interpret spectra spatial arrangement rotamers nuclei resembles enantiomers unequivocal spectroscopic determination absolute configuration r-[h- h- h-]-neopentane therefore presented major challenge one limit possible
