caenorhabditis elegans p53: role apoptosis meiosis stress resistance 
identified homolog mammalian p53 tumor suppressor protein nematode caenorhabditis elegans expressed ubiquitously embryos gene encoding protein cep- promotes dna damage-induced apoptosis required normal meiotic chromosome segregation germ line moreover although somatic apoptosis unaffected cep- mutants show hypersensitivity hypoxia-induced lethality decreased longevity response starvation-induced stress overexpression cep- promotes widespread caspase-independent cell death demonstrating critical importance regulating p53 function appropriate levels findings show c elegans p53 mediates multiple stress responses soma mediates apoptosis meiotic chromosome segregation germ line
