paxx paralog xrcc4 xlf interacts ku promote dna double-strand break repair
xrcc4 xlf two structurally related proteins function dna double-strand break dsb repair identify human paxx paralog xrcc4 xlf also called c9orf142 new xrcc4 superfamily member show crystal structure resembles xrcc4 paxx interacts directly dsb-repair protein ku recruited dna-damage sites cells using rna interference crispr-cas9 generate paxx-/- cells demonstrate paxx functions xrcc4 xlf mediate dsb repair cell survival response dsb-inducing agents finally reveal paxx promotes ku-dependent dna ligation vitro assembly core nonhomologous end-joining nhej factors damaged chromatin cells findings identify paxx new component nhej machinery
