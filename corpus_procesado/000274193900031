directional water collection wetted spider silk
many biological surfaces plant animal kingdom possess unusual structural features micro-and nanometre-scale control interaction water hence wettability- intriguing example provided desert beetles use micrometre-sized patterns hydrophobic hydrophilic regions backs capture water humid air anyone admired spider webs adorned dew drops will appreciate spider silk also capable efficiently collecting water air show water-collecting ability capture silk cribellate spider uloborus walckenaerius result unique fibre structure forms wetting wet-rebuilt fibres characterized periodic spindle-knots made random nanofibrils separated joints made aligned nanofibrils structural features result surface energy gradient spindle-knots joints also difference laplace pressure factors acting together achieve continuous condensation directional collection water drops around spindle-knots submillimetre-sized liquid drops driven surface energy gradients- difference laplace pressure now neither force used overcome larger hysteresis effects make movement micrometre-sized drops difficult tapping driving forces spider silk achieves task inspired finding designed artificial fibres mimic structural features silk exhibit directional water-collecting ability
