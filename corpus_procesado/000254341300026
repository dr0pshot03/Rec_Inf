coupling spin orbital motion electrons carbon nanotubes 
electrons atoms possess spin orbital degrees freedom non relativistic quantum mechanics independent resulting large degeneracies atomic spectra however relativistic effects couple spin orbital motion leading well known fine structure spectra electronic states defect free carbon nanotubes widely believed four fold degenerate- owing independent spin orbital symmetries also possess electron hole symmetry report measurements demonstrating clean nanotubes spin orbital motion electrons coupled thereby breaking symmetries spin orbit coupling directly observed splitting four fold degeneracy single electron ultra clean quantum dots coupling favours parallel alignment orbital spin magnetic moments electrons antiparallel alignment holes measurements consistent recent theories predict existence spin orbit coupling curved graphene describe spin-dependent topological phase nanotubes findings important implications spin based applications carbon-based systems entailing new design principles realization quantum bits qubits nanotubes providing mechanism electrical control spins nanotubes
