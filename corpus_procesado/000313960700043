human thap9 gene encodes active p-element dna transposase 
human genome contains similar genes derived transposable elements transposons many now integral components cellular gene expression programs human thap9 gene related drosophila p-element transposase show human thap9 can mobilize drosophila p-elements drosophila human cells chimeric proteins formed drosophila p-element transposase n-terminal thap dna binding domain c-terminal regions human thap9 can also mobilize drosophila p elements results indicate human thap9 active dna transposase although "domesticated" still retains catalytic activity mobilize p transposable elements across species
