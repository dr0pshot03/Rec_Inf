structure-assigned optical spectra single-walled carbon nanotubes 
spectrofluorimetric measurements single-walled carbon nanotubes swnts isolated aqueous surfactant suspensions revealed distinct electronic absorption emission transitions different semiconducting nanotube species combining fluorimetric results resonance raman data optical transition mapped specific nm nanotube structure optical spectroscopy can thereby used rapidly determine detailed composition bulk swnt samples providing distributions tube diameter chiral angle measured transition frequencies differ substantially simple theoretical predictions deviations may reflect combinations trigonal warping excitonic effects
