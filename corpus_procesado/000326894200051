feature detection orientation tuning drosophila central complex 
many animals including insects known use visual landmarks orient environment drosophila melanogaster behavioural genetics studies identified higher brain structure called central complex required flys innate responses vertical visual features short-and long-term memory visual patterns- whether neurons fly central complex represent visual features unknown use two-photon calcium imaging head-fixed walking flying flies probe visuomotor responses ring neurons-a class central complex neurons implicated landmark-driven spatial memory walking flies memory visual patterns tethered flying flies show dendrites ring neurons visually responsive arranged retinotopically ring neuron receptive fields comprise excitatory inhibitory subfields resembling simple cells mammalian primary visual cortex ring neurons show strong cases direction-selective orientation tuning notable preference vertically oriented features similar evoke innate responses flies visual responses diminished flight contrast hypothesized role central complex control locomotion modulated walking taken together results indicate ring neurons represent behaviourally relevant visual features flys environment enabling downstream central complex circuits produce appropriate motor commands broadly study opens door mechanistic investigations circuit computations underlying visually guided action selection drosophila central complex
