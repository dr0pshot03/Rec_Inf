foundations human reasoning prefrontal cortex
prefrontal cortex pfc subserves reasoning service adaptive behavior little known however architecture reasoning processes pfc using computational modeling neuroimaging show human pfc two concurrent inferential tracks: one ventromedial dorsomedial pfc regions makes probabilistic inferences reliability ongoing behavioral strategy arbitrates adjusting strategy versus exploring new ones long-term memory ii another polar lateral pfc regions makes probabilistic inferences reliability two three alternative strategies arbitrates exploring new strategies versus exploiting alternative ones two tracks interact along striatum realize hypothesis testing accepting versus rejecting newly created strategies
