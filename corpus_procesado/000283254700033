scattering chorus waves dominant cause diffuse auroral precipitation 
earths diffuse aurora occurs broad latitude range primarily caused precipitation low-energy --kev electrons originating central plasma sheet source region hot electrons nightside outer magnetosphere although generally visible diffuse auroral precipitation provides main source energy high-latitude nightside upper atmosphere leading enhanced ionization chemical changes previous theoretical studies indicated two distinct classes magnetospheric plasma wave electrostatic electron cyclotron harmonic waves whistler-mode chorus waves responsible electron scattering leads diffuse auroral precipitation hitherto possible determine important report analysis satellite wave data fokker-planck diffusion calculations reveals scattering chorus dominant cause intense diffuse auroral precipitation resolves long-standing controversy furthermore scattering chorus can remove electrons drift around earths magnetosphere leading development observed pancake distributions can account global morphology diffuse aurora
