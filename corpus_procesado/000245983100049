distinct pathways antigen uptake intracellular routing cd4 cd8 t cell activation
mechanisms allow antigen-presenting cells apcs selectively present extracellular antigen cd8+ effector t cells cross-presentation cd4+ t helper cells fully resolved demonstrated apcs use distinct endocytosis mechanisms simultaneously introduce soluble antigen separate intracellular compartments dedicated presentation cd8+ cd4+ t cells specifically mannose receptor supplied early endosomal compartment distinct lysosomes committed cross-presentation findings imply antigen require intracellular diversion access cross-presentation pathway can enter pathway already endocytosis
