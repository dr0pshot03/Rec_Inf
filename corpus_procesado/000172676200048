imperfect vaccines evolution pathogen virulence 
vaccines rarely provide full protection disease nevertheless partially effective imperfect vaccines may used protect individuals whole populations- studied potential impact different types imperfect vaccines evolution pathogen virulence induced host mortality consequences public health show vaccines designed reduce pathogen growth rate and/or toxicity diminish selection virulent pathogens subsequent evolution leads higher levels intrinsic virulence hence severe disease unvaccinated individuals evolution can erode population-wide benefits overall mortality rates unaffected even increase level vaccination coverage contrast infection-blocking vaccines induce effects can even select lower virulence findings policy implications development use vaccines expected provide full immunity candidate vaccines malaria
