undulatory swimming sand: subsurface locomotion sandfish lizard
desert-dwelling sandfish scincus scincus moves within dry sand material displays solid fluidlike behavior high-speed x-ray imaging shows surface lizard longer uses limbs propulsion generates thrust overcome drag propagating undulatory traveling wave body although viscous hydrodynamics can predict swimming speed fluids water equivalent theory granular drag available predict sandfish swimming speed developed empirical model measuring granular drag force small cylinder oriented different angles relative displacement direction summing forces animal movement profile agreement model experiment implies noninertial swimming occurs frictional fluid
