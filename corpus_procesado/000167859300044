simulating amplification orbital forcing ocean feedbacks last glaciation
according milankovitch theory lower summer insolation high latitudes years ago allowed winter snow persist throughout summer leading ice-sheet build-up glaciation attempts simulate last glaciation using global atmospheric models failed produce outcome forced insolation changes only- results point towards importance feedback effects-for example changes vegetation ocean circulation-for amplification solar forcing- present fully coupled ocean-atmosphere model last glaciation produces build-up perennial snow cover known locations ice sheets period show ocean feedbacks lead cooling high northern latitudes along increase atmospheric moisture transport equator poles changes agree available geological data- together lead increased delivery snow high northern latitudes mechanism present explains onset glaciation-which amplified changes vegetation-in response weak orbital forcing
