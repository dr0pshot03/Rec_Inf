shape temperature memory nanocomposites broadened glass transition 
shape-memory polymers can revert original shape reheated stress generated shape recovery growing function energy absorbed deformation high temperature; thus high energy failure necessary condition strong shape-memory materials report properties composite nanotube fibers exhibit particular feature observed composites can generate stress upon shape recovery two orders magnitude greater generated conventional polymers addition nanoparticles induce broadening glass transition temperature memory peak recovery stress temperature initial deformation
