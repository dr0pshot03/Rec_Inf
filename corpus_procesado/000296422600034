ctcf-promoted rna polymerase ii pausing links dna methylation splicing 
alternative splicing pre-messenger rna key feature transcriptome expansion eukaryotic cells yet regulation poorly understood spliceosome assembly occurs co-transcriptionally raising possibility dna structure may directly influence alternative splicing supporting association recent reports identified distinct histone methylation patterns elevated nucleosome occupancy enriched dna methylation exons relative introns moreover rate transcription elongation linked alternative splicing provide first evidence dna-binding protein ccctc-binding factor ctcf can promote inclusion weak upstream exons mediating local rna polymerase ii pausing mammalian model system alternative splicing cd45 genome-wide show ctcf binding cd45 exon inhibited dna methylation leading reciprocal effects exon inclusion findings provide mechanistic basis developmental regulation splicing outcome heritable epigenetic marks
