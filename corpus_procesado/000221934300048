seawater sulfur isotope fluctuations cretaceous
exogenic sulfur cycle tightly coupled carbon oxygen cycles therefore central component earths biogeochemistry present high-resolution record sulfur isotopic composition seawater sulfate cretaceous general enrichment isotopically light sulfur prevailed cretaceous may due increased volcanic hydrothermal activity two excursions toward isotopically lighter sulfur represent periods lower rates pyrite burial implying shift location organic carbon burial terrestrial open-cean settings concurrent changes seawater sulfur inorganic carbon isotopic compositions imply short-term variability atmospheric oxygen partial pressure
