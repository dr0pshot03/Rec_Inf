drosophila cenh3 sufficient centromere formation 
cenh3 centromere-specific histone h3 variant essential kinetochore assembly despite central role centromere function conclusive evidence supporting cenh3 sufficient determine centromere identity address question artificially targeted drosophila cenh3 cenp-a/cid cid-gfp-laci fusion protein stably integrated lac operator laco arrays ectopic cid focus assembles functional kinetochore directs incorporation cid molecules without laci-anchor providing evidence self-propagation epigenetic mark cid-gfp-laci-bound extrachromosomal laco plasmids can assemble kinetochore proteins bind microtubules resulting stable transmission several cell generations even eliminating cid-gfp-laci conclude cid necessary sufficient serve epigenetic centromere mark nucleate heritable centromere function
