hierarchical genetic organization human cortical surface area 
surface area cerebral cortex highly heritable trait yet little known genetic influences regional cortical differentiation humans using data-driven fuzzy clustering technique magnetic resonance imaging data twins parceled cortical surface area genetic subdivisions creating human brain atlas based solely genetically informative data boundaries genetic divisions corresponded largely meaningful structural functional regions; however divisions represented previously undescribed phenotypes different conventional non-genetically based parcellation systems genetic organization cortical area hierarchical modular predominantly bilaterally symmetric across hemispheres also found results consistent human-specific regions subdivisions previously described genetically based lobar regionalization patterns
