role lateral hypothalamic orexin neurons reward seeking 
lateral hypothalamus brain region historically implicated reward motivation identity neurotransmitters involved unknown orexins hypocretins neuropeptides recently identified neurotransmitters lateral hypothalamus neurons although knockout transgenic overexpression studies implicated orexin neurons arousal sleep cells also project reward associated brain regions including nucleus accumbens ventral tegmental area indicates possible role neurons reward function motivation consistent previous studies implicating neurons feeding show activation lateral hypothalamus orexin neurons strongly linked preferences cues associated drug food reward addition show chemical activation lateral hypothalamus orexin neurons reinstates extinguished drug seeking behaviour reinstatement effect completely blocked prior administration orexin antagonist moreover administration orexin peptide directly ventral tegmental area also reinstated drug seeking data reveal new role lateral hypothalamus orexin neurons reward seeking drug relapse addiction
