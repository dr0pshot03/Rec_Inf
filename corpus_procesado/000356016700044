histone h3 required endogenous retroviral element silencing embryonic stem cells
transposable elements comprise roughly % mammalian genomes active role genetic variation adaptation evolution duplication deletion genes regulatory elements- transposable elements can act alternative promoters nearby genes resulting noncanonical regulation transcription however transposable element activity can lead detrimental genome instability hosts evolved mechanisms silence transposable element mobility appropriately recent studies demonstrated subset transposable elements endogenous retroviral elements ervs containing long terminal repeats ltrs silenced trimethylation histone h3 lysine h3k9me3 eset also known setdb1 kmt1e co-repressor complex containing krab-associated protein kap1 also known trim28 mouse embryonic stem cells show replacement histone variant h3 enriched class class ii ervs notably early transposon etn/musd family intracisternal a-type particles iaps deposition subset elements dependent upon h3 chaperone complex containing alpha-thalassaemia/mental retardation syndrome x-linked atrx death-domain-associated protein daxx- demonstrate recruitment daxx h3 kap1 ervs co-dependent occurs upstream eset linking h3 erv-associated h3k9me3 importantly h3k9me3 reduced ervs upon h3 deletion resulting derepression dysregulation adjacent endogenous genes along increased retrotransposition iaps study identifies unique heterochromatin state marked presence h3 h3k9me3 establishes important role h3 control erv retrotransposition embryonic stem cells
