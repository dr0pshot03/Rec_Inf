rna-binding protein nrd1 directs polya-independent -end formation rna polymerase ii transcripts
eukaryotic chromosome contains many genes transcribed separately rna polymerase pol ii iii transcription termination genes prevents formation polycistronic rnas anti-sense rnas generally detrimental correct expression genes terminating transcription protein-coding genes pol ii requires group proteins also direct cleavage polyadenylation messenger rna response specific sequence element associated carboxyl-terminal domain largest subunit pol ii refs contrast cis-acting elements trans-acting factors direct termination non-polyadenylated transcripts made pol ii including small nucleolar small nuclear rnas known show read-through transcription yeast small nucleolar rna small nuclear rna genes adjacent genes prevented cis-acting element recognized part essential rna-binding protein nrd1 rna-binding protein nab3 putative rna helicase sen1 intact c-terminal domain pol ii also required efficient response element proteins required maintaining normal levels nrd1 mrna indicating proteins may control elongation subset mrna transcripts
