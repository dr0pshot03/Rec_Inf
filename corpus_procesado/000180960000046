rewiring map kinase pathways using alternative scaffold assembly mechanisms
scaffold proteins control information flow signaling pathways poorly understood: simply tether components precisely orient activate found yeast mitogen-activated protein map kinase scaffold ste5 tolerant major stereochemical perturbations heterologous protein interactions functionally replace native kinase recruitment interactions indicating simple tethering largely sufficient scaffold-mediated signaling moreover engineering scaffold tethers unique kinase set create synthetic map kinase pathway non-natural input-output properties findings demonstrate scaffolds highly flexible organizing factors can facilitate pathway evolution engineering
