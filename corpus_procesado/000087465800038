newly synthesized lithium interstellar medium 
astronomical observations elemental isotopic abundances provide means determine source elements reveal evolutionary pathways since formation galaxy billion years ago abundance lithium particularly interesting although thought primordial results spallation reactions galactic cosmic rays break apart larger nuclei interstellar medium spallation reactions crucial production light elements1 beryllium boron observations lithium isotopic abundances can used test model predictions2- light-element synthesis general report observations li- li- abundances several interstellar clouds lying direction star o persei rnd abundance ratio li-/li- significantly lower average solar system value refs abundance ratio clear evidence observed lithium must resulted entirely spallation confirming basic tenet light-element synthesis2- total lithium abundance however enhanced expected
