inhibition neuroepithelial patched-induced apoptosis sonic hedgehog
early development vertebrates sonic hedgehog shh produced notochord floor plate ventrodorsal gradient shh directs ventrodorsal patterning neural tube however shh also required survival neuroepithelial cells show patched ptc induces apoptotic cell death unless ligand shh present block signal moreover blockade ptc-induced cell death partly rescues chick spinal cord defect provoked shh deprivation thus proapoptotic activity unbound ptc positive effect shh-bound ptc cell differentiation probably cooperate achieve appropriate spinal cord development
