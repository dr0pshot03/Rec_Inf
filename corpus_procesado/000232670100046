shocks ion sputtering sharpen steep surface features
report regime ion beam sputtering occurs sufficiently steep slopes high slopes propagate large distances without dissipating steepest features propagation velocity dynamically selected slope universal independent details initial shape surface resulting behavior can understood propagation shock front self-selects stable slope previously observed thin-film fluid flows experiments confirm predictions theory important implication propagative behavior high surface slopes pattern can fabricated large length scale uniform ion irradiation reduced smaller length scale preserving even sharpening sharpest features
