towards bose-einstein condensation excitons potential traps
exciton electron-hole bound pair semiconductor low-density limit composite bose quasi-particle akin hydrogen atom just dilute atomic gases reducing temperature increasing exciton density increases occupation numbers low-energy states leading quantum degeneracy eventually bose-einstein condensation bec exciton mass small-even smaller free electron mass-exciton bec occur temperatures k many orders magnitude higher atoms however practice difficult reach bec conditions temperature excitons can considerably exceed semiconductor lattice search exciton bec concentrated long-lived excitons: exciton lifetime electron-hole recombination therefore exceed characteristic timescale cooling initially hot photo-generated excitons- now experiments atom condensation performed atomic gases confined potential traps inspired experiments using specially designed semiconductor nanostructures collected quasi-two-dimensional excitons in-plane potential trap photoluminescence measurements show quasi-two-dimensional excitons indeed condense bottom traps giving rise statistically degenerate bose gas
