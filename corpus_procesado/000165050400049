photorefractive organically modified silica glass high optical gain
photorefractive materials exhibit spatial modulation refractive index due redistribution photogenerated charges optically nonlinear medium ability manipulate light potentially important optical applications including image processing optical storage programmable optical interconnects simulation neural networks photorefractive materials generally crystals polymers glasses electro-optic birefringent properties noncentrosymmetric structure report photorefractive effect non-centrosymmetric centrosymmetric azo-dye-doped silica glasses refractive index gratings spatially phase-shifted respect incident light intensity pattern observed effect results nonlocal response material optical illumination enables transfer energy two interfering light beams asymmetric two-beam coupling although writing time present grating relatively slow achieved two-beam coupling optical gain cm- centrosymmetric glasses gain cm- non-centrosymmetric structures latter fabricated using corona discharge process induce permanent arrangement azo-dye chromophores
