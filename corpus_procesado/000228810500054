cellular microrna mediates antiviral defense human cells 
eukaryotes -nucteotide-long rnas engage sequence-specific interactions inhibit gene expression rna silencing process regulatory roles involving micrornas plants insects also forms basis defense mechanism directed small interfering rnas derive replicative integrated viral genomes show cellular microrna effectively restricts accumulation retrovirus primate foamy virus type pfv- human cells pfv- also encodes protein tas suppresses microrna-directed functions mammalian cells displays cross-kingdom antisilencing activities therefore fortuitous recognition foreign nucleic acids cellular micrornas direct antiviral effects addition regulatory functions
