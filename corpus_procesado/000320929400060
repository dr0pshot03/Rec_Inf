unusual architecture p7 channel hepatitis c virus 
hepatitis c virus hcv developed small membrane protein p7 remarkably can self-assemble large channel complex selectively conducts cations- wanted examine structural solution viroporin adopts order achieve selective cation conduction p7 homology known prokaryotic eukaryotic channel proteins activity p7 can inhibited amantadine rimantadine potent blockers influenza m2 channel licensed drugs influenza infections adamantane derivatives used hcv clinical trials large variation drug efficacy among various hcv genotypes difficult explain without detailed molecular structures determine structures hcv viroporin well drug-binding site using latest nuclear magnetic resonance nmr technologies structure exhibits unusual mode hexameric assembly individual p7 monomers interact immediate neighbours also reach farther associate i+ i+ monomers forming sophisticated funnel-like architecture structure also points mechanism cation selection: asparagine/histidine ring constricts narrow end funnel serves broad cation selectivity filter whereas arginine/lysine ring defines wide end funnel may selectively allow cation diffusion channel functional investigation using whole-cell channel recording shows residues critical channel activity nmr measurements channel-drug complex revealed six equivalent hydrophobic pockets peripheral pore-forming helices amantadine rimantadine binds compound binding specifically position may allosterically inhibit cation conduction preventing channel opening data provide molecular explanation p7-mediated cation conductance inhibition adamantane derivatives
