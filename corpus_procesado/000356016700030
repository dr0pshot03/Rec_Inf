cloning variation ground state intestinal stem cells 
stem cells gastrointestinal tract pancreas liver columnar epithelia collectively resist cloning elemental states demonstrate cloning propagation highly clonogenic ground state stem cells human intestine colon show derived stem-cell pedigrees sustain limited copy number sequence variation despite extensive serial passaging display exquisitely precise cell-autonomous commitment epithelial differentiation consistent origins along intestinal tract developmentally patterned epigenetically maintained commitment stem cells likely enforce functional specificity adult intestinal tract using clonally derived colonic epithelia show toxins b enteric pathogen clostridium difficile recapitulate salient features pseudomembranous colitis stability epigenetic commitment programs stem cells coupled unlimited replicative expansion maintained clonogenicity suggests certain advantages use disease modelling regenerative medicine
