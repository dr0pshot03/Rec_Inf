oocyte-specific deletion pten causes premature activation primordial follicle pool
mammalian ovary progressive activation primordial follicles dormant pool serves source fertilizable ova menopause end female reproductive life occurs primordial follicle pool exhausted however molecular mechanisms underlying follicle activation poorly understood provide genetic evidence mice lacking pten phosphatase tensin homolog deleted chromosome oocytes major negative regulator phosphatidylinositol kinase pi3k entire primordial follicle pool becomes activated subsequently primordial follicles become depleted early adulthood causing premature ovarian failure pof results show mammalian oocyte serves headquarters programming follicle activation oocyte pten pi3k pathway governs follicle activation control initiation oocyte growth
