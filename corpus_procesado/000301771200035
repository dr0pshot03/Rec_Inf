suppression antiviral response influenza histone mimic
viral infection commonly associated virus-driven hijacking host proteins describe novel mechanism influenza virus affects host cells interaction influenza non-structural protein ns1 infected cell epigenome show ns1 protein influenza h3n2 subtype possesses histone-like sequence histone mimic used virus target human paf1 transcription elongation complex hpaf1c demonstrate binding ns1 hpaf1c depends ns1 histone mimic results suppression hpaf1c-mediated transcriptional elongation furthermore human paf1 crucial role antiviral response loss hpaf1c binding ns1 attenuates influenza infection whereas hpaf1c deficiency reduces antiviral gene expression renders cells susceptible viruses propose histone mimic ns1 enables influenza virus affect inducible gene expression selectively thus contributing suppression antiviral response
