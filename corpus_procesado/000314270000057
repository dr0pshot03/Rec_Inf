emergent sensing complex environments mobile animal groups
capacity groups exhibit collective intelligence often-cited advantage group living previous studies shown social organisms frequently benefit pooling imperfect individual estimates however principle collective intelligence may also emerge interactions individuals rather enhancement personal estimates reveal emergent problem solving predominant mechanism mobile animal group responds complex environmental gradients robust collective sensing arises group level individuals modulating speed response local scalar measurements light social interaction others distributed sensing requires rudimentary cognition thus widespread across biological taxa addition appropriate cost-effective robotic agents
