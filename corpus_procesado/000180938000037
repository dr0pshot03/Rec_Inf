experimental realization freely propagating teleported qubits 
quantum teleportation1 central quantum communication plays important role number quantum computation protocols23 information-processing applications quantum teleportation include subsequent manipulation qubit teleported photon highly desirable teleportation procedure resulting high-quality freely flying qubits previous teleportation experiment4 teleported qubit detected thus destroyed verify success procedure report teleportation experiment results freely propagating individual qubits basic idea suppress unwanted coincidence detection events providing photon teleported much less frequently auxiliary entangled pair therefore case successful teleportation can identified high probability without need actually detect teleported photon experimental fidelity procedure surpasses theoretical limit required implementation quantum repeaters56
