rewiring yeast transcriptional network evolution motif usage
recent experiments revealed large-scale differences transcription programs related species yet little known genetic basis underlying evolution gene expression contribution phenotypic diversity describe large-scale modulation yeast transcription program connected emergence capacity rapid anaerobic growth genes coding mitochondrial cytoplasmic ribosomal proteins display strongly correlated expression pattern candida albicans correlation lost fermentative yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae provide evidence change gene expression connected loss specific cis-regulatory element dozens genes following apparent whole-genome duplication event results shed new light genetic mechanisms underlying large-scale evolution transcriptional networks
