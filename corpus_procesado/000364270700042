ion channels enable electrical communication bacterial communities 
study bacterial ion channels provided fundamental insights structural basis neuronal signalling however native role ion channels bacteria remained elusive show ion channels conduct long-range electrical signals within bacterial biofilm communities spatially propagating waves potassium waves result positive feedback loop metabolic trigger induces release intracellular potassium turn depolarizes neighbouring cells propagating biofilm wave depolarization coordinates metabolic states among cells interior periphery biofilm deletion potassium channel abolishes response predicted mathematical model show spatial propagation can hindered specific genetic perturbations potassium channel gating together results demonstrate function ion channels bacterial biofilms provide prokaryotic paradigm active long-range electrical signalling cellular communities
