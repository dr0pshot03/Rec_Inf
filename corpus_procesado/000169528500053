multiple pathways cooperate suppression genome instability saccharomyces cerevisiae
gross chromosome rearrangements gcrs translocations deletion chromosome arm interstitial deletions inversions often observed cancer cells- spontaneous gcrs rare saccharomyces cerevisiae however existence mutator mutants increased genome instability suggests gcrs actively suppressed show genetic analysis genome rearrangements probably result dna replication errors suppressed least three interacting pathways groups proteins: s-phase checkpoint functions recombination proteins proteins prevent de novo addition telomeres double-strand breaks dsbs mutations inactivate pathways cause high rates gcrs show synergistic interactions indicating pathways suppress gcrs compete dna substrates
