nmda receptor blockade rest triggers rapid behavioural antidepressant responses 
clinical studies consistently demonstrate single sub-psychomimetic dose ketamine ionotropic glutamatergic nmdar n-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist produces fast-acting antidepressant responses patients suffering major depressive disorder although underlying mechanism unclear- depressed patients report alleviation major depressive disorder symptoms within two hours single low-dose intravenous infusion ketamine effects lasting two weeks- unlike traditional antidepressants serotonin re-uptake inhibitors take weeks reach efficacy delay major drawback current therapies major depressive disorder faster-acting antidepressants needed particularly suicide-risk patients ability ketamine produce rapidly acting long-lasting antidepressant responses depressed patients provides unique opportunity investigate underlying cellular mechanisms show ketamine nmdar antagonists produce fast-acting behavioural antidepressant-like effects mouse models effects depend rapid synthesis brain-derived neurotrophic factor find ketamine-mediated blockade nmdar rest deactivates eukaryotic elongation factor eef2 kinase also called camkiii resulting reduced eef2 phosphorylation de-suppression translation brain-derived neurotrophic factor furthermore find inhibitors eef2 kinase induce fast-acting behavioural antidepressant-like effects findings indicate regulation protein synthesis spontaneous neurotransmission may serve viable therapeutic target development fast-acting antidepressants
