diversity quasars unified accretion orientation 
quasars rapidly accreting supermassive black holes centres massive galaxies display broad range properties across wavelengths reflecting diversity physical conditions regions close central engine properties however random form well-defined trends dominant trend known eigenvector l many properties correlate strength optical iron [o iii] emission- main physical driver eigenvector long suspected quasar luminosity normalized mass hole eddington ratio important parameter black hole accretion process definitive proof missing report analysis archival data reveals eddington ratio indeed drives eigenvector also find orientation plays significant role determining observed kinematics gas broad-line region implying flattened disk-like geometry fast-moving clouds close black hole results show diversity quasar phenomenology can unified using two simple quantities: eddington ratio orientation
