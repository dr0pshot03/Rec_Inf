netrin receptor unc5b mediates guidance events controlling morphogenesis vascular system 
blood vessels nerves complex branched structures share high degree anatomical similarity guidance vessels nerves exquisitely regulated ensure proper wiring systems several regulators axon guidance identified also expressed endothelial cells however extent guidance functions conserved vascular system still incompletely understood show repulsive netrin receptor unc5b expressed endothelial tip cells vascular system disruption unc5b gene mice unc5b netrin-1a zebrafish leads aberrant extension endothelial tip cell filopodia excessive vessel branching abnormal navigation netrin causes endothelial filopodial retraction unc5b present thus unc5b functions repulsive netrin receptor endothelial cells controlling morphogenesis vascular system
