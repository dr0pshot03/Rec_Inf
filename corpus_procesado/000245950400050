swifts control glide performance morphing wings 
gliding birds continually change shape size wings- presumably exploit profound effect wing morphology aerodynamic performance- birds adjust wing sweep suit glide speed predicted qualitatively analytical glide models extrapolated wings performance envelope aerodynamic theory describe aerodynamic structural performance actual swift wings measured wind tunnel basis build semiempirical glide model measuring inside outside swifts behavioural envelope show choosing suitable sweep can halve sink speed triple turning rate extended wings superior slow glides turns swept wings superior fast glides turns superiority due better aerodynamic performance exception fast turns swept wings less effective generating lift turning high speeds can bear extreme loads finally glide model predicts cost-effective gliding occurs speeds m s- whereas agility-related figures merit peak m s- fact swifts spend night roost flight m s- ref thus model can explain choice resting behaviour morphing adjusts birds wing performance task hand also control flight future aircraft
