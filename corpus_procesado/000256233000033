interfacial polygonal nanopatterning stable microbubbles 
micrometer sized bubbles unstable therefore difficult make store substantial lengths time short term stabilization achieved addition amphiphilic molecules reduce driving force dissolution molecules crystallize air/ liquid interface lifetime individual bubbles may extend months demonstrated low gas fraction dispersions mean bubble radii less micrometer stability lasting year insoluble self assembled surfactant layer covers surface microbubbles can result nanometer scale hexagonal patterning explain thermodynamic molecular models elastic response interface arrests shrinkage bubbles study identifies route fabricate highly stable dispersions microbubbles
