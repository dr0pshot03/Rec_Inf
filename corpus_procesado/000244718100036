observation two-channel kondo effect
intriguing problems solid-state physics arise motion one electron dramatically affects motion surrounding electrons traditionally highly correlated electron systems studied mainly materials complex transition metal chemistry past decade researchers learned confine one electrons within nanometre-scale semiconductor artificial atom understand control simple system detail combine artificial atoms create highly correlated electron system within nano-engineered semiconductor structure tune system situ quantum phase transition two distinct states version kondo state bound electron interacts surrounding mobile electrons boundary competing kondo states quantum critical point namely exotic previously elusive two-channel kondo state electrons two reservoirs entangled interaction single localized spin
