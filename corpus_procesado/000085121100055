dexh protein nph-ii processive directional motor unwinding rna
aspects cellular rna metabolism processing involve dexh/d proteins family enzymes unwind manipulate rna atp-dependent fashion dexh/d proteins also essential replication many viruses therefore provide targets development therapeutics dexh/d proteins characterized date hydrolyse nucleoside triphosphates cases activity stimulated addition rna dna several members family unwind rna duplexes ntp-dependent fashion vitro therefore proposed dexh/d proteins couple ntp hydrolysis rna conformational chang-e complex macromolecular assemblies despite central role dexh/d proteins mechanism rna helicase activity remains unknown show dexh protein nph-ii unwinds rna duplexes processive unidirectional fashion step size roughly one-half helix turn show quantitative connection atp utilization helicase processivity thereby providing direct evidence dexh/d proteins can function molecular motors rna
