indium phosphide nanowires building blocks nanoscale electronic optoelectronic devices 
nanowires nanotubes carry charge excitons efficiently therefore potentially ideal building blocks nanoscale electronics optoelectronics carbon nanotubes already exploited devices field-effect single-electron transistors practical utility nanotube components building electronic circuits limited yet possible selectively grow semiconducting metallic nanotubes report assembly functional nanoscale devices indium phosphide nanowires electrical properties controlled selective doping gate-voltage-dependent transport measurements demonstrate nanowires can predictably synthesized either n p-type doped nanowires function nanoscale field-effect transistors can assembled crossed-wire p-n junctions exhibit rectifying behaviour significantly p-n junctions emit light strongly perhaps smallest light-emitting diodes yet made finally show electric-field-directed assembly can used create highly integrated device arrays nanowire building blocks
