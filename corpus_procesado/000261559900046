enantiodivergent conversion chiral secondary alcohols tertiary alcohols 
receptors nose supramolecular biopolymers nature shows remarkable degree specificity recognition chiral molecules resulting mirror image arrangements two forms eliciting quite different biological responses12 thus critically important chemical synthesis chiral molecules one two three dimensional arrangements created although certain classes chiral molecules example secondary alcohols34 now easy make selectively single mirror image form one class containing quaternary stereogenic centres carbon atom four different non hydrogen substituents remains great challenge5- present general solution problem takes easily obtainable secondary alcohols single mirror image form two step sequence converts tertiary alcohols quaternary stereogenic centres overall process involves removing hydrogen atom attached carbon secondary alcohol effectively replacing alkyl alkenyl aryl group furthermore starting single mirror image form secondary alcohol either mirror image form tertiary alcohol can made high levels stereo control thus broad range tertiary alcohols can now easily made method high levels selectivity expect methodology find widespread application intermediate tertiary boronic esters can potentially converted range functional groups retention configuration
