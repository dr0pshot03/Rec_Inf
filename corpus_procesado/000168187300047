cooperation competition evolution atp-producing pathways 
heterotrophic organisms generally face trade-off rate yield adenosine triphosphate atp production trade-off may result evolutionary dilemma cells higher rate lower yield atp production may gain selective advantage competing shared energy resources using analysis model simulations biochemical observations show atp production low rate high yield can viewed form cooperative resource use may evolve spatially structured environments furthermore argue high atp yield respiration may facilitated evolutionary transition unicellular undifferentiated multicellular organisms
