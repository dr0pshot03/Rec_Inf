chromosome alignment segregation regulated ubiquitination survivin 
proper chromosome segregation requires attachment sister kinetochores microtubules opposite spindle poles form bi-oriented chromosomes metaphase spindle chromosome passenger complex containing survivin kinase aurora b regulates process centromeres report de-ubiquitinating enzyme hfam regulates chromosome alignment segregation controlling dynamic association survivin centromeres proper targeting survivin aurora b centromeres survivin ubiquitinated mitosis lys lys ubiquitin linkages lys de-ubiquitination mediated hfam required dissociation survivin centromeres whereas lys ubiquitination mediated ubiquitin binding protein ufd1 required association survivin centromeres thus ubiquitinaton regulates dynamic protein-protein interactions chromosome segregation independently protein degradation
