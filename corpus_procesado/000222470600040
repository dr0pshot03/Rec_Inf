export dissolved organic carbon peatlands elevated carbon dioxide levels 
peatlands represent vast store global carbon observations rapidly rising dissolved organic carbon concentrations rivers draining peatlands created concerns stores beginning destabilize three main factors put forward potential causal mechanisms appears two alternatives-warming increased river discharge-cannot offer satisfactory explanations show third proposed mechanism namely shifting trends proportion annual rainfall arriving summer similarly unable account trend instead infer previously unrecognized mechanism-carbon dioxide mediated stimulation primary productivity-is responsible elevated carbon dioxide levels proportion dissolved organic carbon derived recently assimilated carbon dioxide ten times higher control cases concentrations dissolved organic carbon appear far sensitive environmental drivers affect net primary productivity affecting decomposition alone
