neoplastic gene fusion mimics trans-splicing rnas normal human cells 
chromosomal rearrangements create gene fusions common features human tumors prevailing view resultant chimeric transcripts proteins abnormal tumor specific products provide tumor cells growth and/ survival advantage show normal endometrial stromal cells contain specific chimeric rna joining exons jazf1 gene chromosome 7p15 exons polycomb group gene jjaz1/suz12 chromosome 17q11 rna translated jazf1-jjaz1 protein anti apoptotic activity jazf1-jjaz1 rna appears arise physiologically regulated trans splicing precursor messenger rnas jazf1 jjaz1 chimeric rna protein identical produced gene fusion found human endometrial stromal tumors observations suggest certain gene fusions may pro neoplastic owing constitutive expression chimeric gene products normally generated trans splicing rnas developing tissues
