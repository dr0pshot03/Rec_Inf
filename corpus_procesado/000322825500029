observed correlation plume activity tidal stresses enceladus 
saturns moon enceladus emits plume water vapour micrometre-sized ice particles series warm fissures located near south pole- geological activity powered controlled variations tidal stresses experienced enceladus moves around slightly eccentric orbit specific mechanisms varying stresses converted heat however still debated- furthermore proved difficult find clear correlation predicted tidal forces measured temporal variations plumes gas content- particle flux individual sources report plumes horizontally integrated brightness several times greater enceladus near point eccentric orbit furthest saturn apocentre near point closest approach planet pericentre material therefore seems escaping beneath enceladus surface times geophysical models predict fissures tension therefore may wider open
