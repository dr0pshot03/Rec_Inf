engineered reversal beta-oxidation cycle synthesis fuels chemicals 
advanced long-chain fuels chemicals generated short-chain metabolic intermediates pathways require carbon-chain elongation condensation reactions mediating carbon-carbon bond formation can catalysed enzymes thiolase superfamily including beta-ketoacyl-acyl-carrier protein acp synthases polyketide synthases -hydroxy--methylglutaryl-coa synthases biosynthetic thiolases1 pathways involving enzymes exploited fuel chemical production fatty-acid biosynthesis beta-ketoacyl-acp synthases attracting attention recent years2- degradative thiolases part thiolase superfamily naturally function beta-oxidation fatty acids56 can also operate synthetic direction thus enable carbon-chain elongation demonstrate functional reversal beta-oxidation cycle can used metabolic platform synthesis alcohols carboxylic acids various chain lengths functionalities pathway operates coenzyme coa thioester intermediates directly uses acetylcoa acyl-chain elongation rather first requiring atp-dependent activation malonyl-coa characteristics enable product synthesis maximum carbon energy efficiency reversal beta-oxidation cycle engineered escherichia coli used combination endogenous dehydrogenases thioesterases synthesize n-alcohols fatty acids -hydroxy- -keto trans-delta2-carboxylic acids superior nature engineered pathway demonstrated producing higher-chain linear n-alcohols c > extracellular long-chain fatty acids c > higher efficiency previously reported247- ubiquitous nature beta-oxidation aldehyde/alcohol dehydrogenase thioesterase enzymes potential enable efficient synthesis products industrial organisms
