central image gravitationally lensed quasar 
galaxy can act gravitational lens producing multiple images background object theory predicts odd number images produced lens hitherto almost lensed objects two four images missing central images faint appear near centre lensing galaxy long sought probes galactic cores distant resolve ordinary observations- five candidates central images one case third image necessarily central one- others putative central images might foreground sources- report secure identification central image based radio observations one candidates lens models using central image reveal massive black hole centre lensing galaxy mass <2x10 solar masses m-&odot galaxys surface density location central image > m-circle dot pc- agreement expections based observations galaxies much closer earth
