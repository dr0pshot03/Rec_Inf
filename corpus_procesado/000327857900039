oscillatory control factors determining multipotency fate mouse neural progenitors
basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors ascl1/mash1 hes1 olig2 regulate fate choice neurons astrocytes oligodendrocytes respectively factors coexpressed neural progenitor cells found time-lapse imaging factors expressed oscillatory manner mouse neural progenitor cells differentiation lineage one factors becomes dominant used optogenetics control expression ascl1 found although sustained ascl1 expression promotes neuronal fate determination oscillatory ascl1 expression maintains proliferating neural progenitor cells thus multipotent state correlates oscillatory expression several fate-determination factors whereas differentiated state correlates sustained expression single factor
