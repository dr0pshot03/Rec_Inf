clustered star formation natural explanation h alpha cut-off disk galaxies 
rate star formation galaxy often determined observation emission h alpha line related presence short lived massive stars disk galaxies show strong cut h alpha radiation certain galactocentric distance led conclusion star formation suppressed outer regions disk galaxies seemingly contradiction recent observations ultraviolet imply disk galaxies star formation beyond h alpha cut star-formation-rate surface density linearly related underlying gas surface density shallower relationship derived h alpha luminosities galaxy wide formulation clustered nature star formation recently led insight total galactic h alpha luminosity nonlinearly related galaxy wide star formation rate show local formulation concept clustered star formation naturally leads steeper radial decrease h alpha surface luminosity star-formation-rate surface density quantitative agreement observations observed h alpha cut arises naturally
