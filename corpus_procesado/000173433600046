nitrogen loss unpolluted south american forests mainly via dissolved organic compounds 
conceptual- numerical- models nitrogen cycling temperate forests assume nitrogen lost ecosystems predominantly way inorganic forms nitrate ammonium ions nitrate thought particularly mobile responsible nitrogen loss deep soil stream waters human activities-such fossil fuel combustion fertilizer production land-use change-have substantially altered nitrogen cycle large regions making difficult separate natural aspects nitrogen cycling induced human perturbations report stream chemistry data unpolluted primary forests temperate south america although sites exhibit broad range environmental factors influence ecosystem nutrient cycles- climate parent material time ecosystem development topography biotic diversity observed remarkably consistent pattern nitrogen loss across forests contrast findings forests polluted regions streamwater nitrate concentrations exceedingly low nitrate ammonium ratios less unity dissolved organic nitrogen responsible majority nitrogen losses forests therefore suggest organic nitrogen losses considered models forest nutrient cycling help explain observations nutrient limitation temperate forest ecosystems
