kinetic redistribution native misfolded rnas dead-box chaperone 
dexd/h-box proteins ubiquitously involved rna-mediated processes use atp accelerate conformational changes rna however mechanisms action determines rna species targeted well understood show dexd/h-box protein cyt- general rna chaperone mediates atp-dependent unfolding native conformation long-lived misfolded conformation group catalytic rna efficiencies depend stabilities rna species specific structural features cyt- allows rna refold changing distribution equilibrium kinetic control misfolding favoured kinetically conditions allow unfolding native rna yield large increases population misfolded species results suggest dexd/h-box proteins act sufficient breadth efficiency allow structured rnas populate wider range conformations present equilibrium thus rnas may face selective pressure stabilize active conformations relative inactive ones avoid significant redistribution dexd/h-box proteins conversely rnas whose functions depend forming multiple conformations may rely dexd/h-box proteins increase populations less stable conformations thereby increasing overall efficiencies
