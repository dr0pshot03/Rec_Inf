asymptotic prey profitability drives star-nosed moles foraging speed limit
foraging theory provides models predicting predator diet choices assuming natural selection favoured predators maximize rate energy intake foraging- prey profitability energy gained divided prey handling time essential variable estimating optimal diet time constraints capturing consuming prey generally result handling times ranging minutes seconds yet profitability increases dramatically handling time approaches zero providing potential strong directional selection increasing predator speed high encounter rates tiny increments speed increase profitability markedly allowing expanded diets smaller prey provide evidence unusual anatomical behavioural specializations characterizing star-nosed moles resulted progressively stronger selection speed allowing progressive addition small prey diet report handling times short ms mean ms moles identifying eating prey double takes prey identification suggest star-nosed moles reached speed limit processing tactile information exceptional speed star-nosed moles coupled unusual specializations finding eating tiny prey provide new support optimal foraging theory
