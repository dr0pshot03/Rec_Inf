hippocampal place fields emerge upon single-cell manipulation excitability behavior 
origin spatial receptive fields hippocampal place cells established hippocampal ca1 pyramidal cell receives thousands synaptic inputs mostly spatially tuned neurons; however postsynaptic neurons cellular properties determine response inputs behavior unknown discovered contrary expectations basic models place cells neuronal integration small spatially uniform depolarization spatially untuned somatic membrane potential silent cell leads sudden reversible emergence spatially tuned subthreshold response place-field spiking gating inputs postsynaptic neuronal excitability reveals cellular mechanism receptive field origin may critical formation hippocampal memory representations
