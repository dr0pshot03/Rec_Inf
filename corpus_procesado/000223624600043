distinct ensemble codes hippocampal areas ca3 ca1
hippocampus differentiated extensively connected recurrent stage ca3 followed feed-forward stage ca1 examined function structural differentiation determining cell ensembles rat ca3 ca1 generate representations rooms common spatial elements ca3 distinct subsets pyramidal cells activated room regardless similarity testing enclosure ca1 activated populations overlapped overlap increased similar enclosures exposure novel room ensemble activity developed slower ca3 ca1 suggesting representations emerged independently
