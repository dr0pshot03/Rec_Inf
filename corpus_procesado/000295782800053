reserve stem cell population small intestine renders lgr5-positive cells dispensable
small intestine epithelium renews every days making one regenerative mammalian tissues genetic inducible fate mapping studies identified two principal epithelial stem cell pools tissue one pool consists columnar lgr5-expressing cells cycle rapidly present predominantly crypt base pool consists bmi1-expressing cells largely reside crypt base however relative functions two pools interrelationship understood specifically ablated lgr5-expressing cells mice using human diphtheria toxin receptor dtr gene knocked lgr5 locus found complete loss lgr5-expressing cells perturb homeostasis epithelium indicating cell types can compensate elimination population ablation lgr5-expressing cells progeny production bmi1-expressing cells increased indicating bmi1-expressing stem cells compensate loss lgr5-expressing cells indeed lineage tracing showed bmi1-expressing cells gave rise lgr5-expressing cells pointing hierarchy stem cells intestinal epithelium results demonstrate lgr5-expressing cells dispensable normal intestinal homeostasis absence cells bmi1-expressing cells can serve alternative stem cell pool data provide first experimental evidence interrelationship populations bmi1-expressing stem cells may represent reserve stem cell pool case injury small intestine epithelium source replenishment lgr5-expressing cells non-pathological conditions
