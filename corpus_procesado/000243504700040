reversible stress softening actin networks 
mechanical properties cells play essential role numerous physiological processes organized networks semiflexible actin filaments determine cell stiffness transmit force mechanotransduction cytokinesis cell motility cellular shape changes- although numerous actin-binding proteins identified organize networks mechanical properties actin networks physiological architectures concentrations difficult measure quantitatively studies mechanical properties vitro found crosslinked networks actin filaments formed solution exhibit stress stiffening arising entropic elasticity individual filaments crosslinkers resisting extension- report reversible stress-softening behaviour actin networks reconstituted vitro suggests critical role filaments resisting compression using modified atomic force microscope probe dendritic actin networks like formed lamellipodia motile cells observe stress stiffening followed regime reversible stress softening higher loads softening behaviour can explained elastic buckling individual filaments compression avoids catastrophic fracture network observation stress stiffening softening suggests complex interplay entropic enthalpic elasticity determining mechanical properties actin networks
