exactly solvable model quantum communications
information theory establishes ultimate limits performance noisy communication systems accurate models physical communication devices must include quantum effects typically make theory intractable- result communication capacities-the maximum possible rates data transmission-are known even transmission two users connected electromagnetic waveguide gaussian noise present exactly solvable model communication fully quantum electromagnetic field gives explicit expressions point-to-point capacities noisy quantum channels implications quantum key distribution fibre-optic communications also develop theory quantum communication networks solving rudimentary models including broadcast multiple-access channels compare predictions model orthodox gaussian model cases find agreement within bits high signal-to-noise ratios simple model captures relevant physics remaining amenable exact solution
