natural history evolutionary principles gene duplication fungi
gene duplication loss powerful source functional innovation however general principles govern process still largely unknown growing number sequenced genomes now possible examine events comprehensive unbiased manner develop procedure resolves evolutionary history genes large group species apply procedure seventeen fungal genomes create genome-wide catalogue gene trees determine precise orthology paralogy relations across species show gene duplication loss highly constrained functional properties interacting partners genes particular stress-related genes exhibit many duplications losses whereas growth-related genes show selection changes whole genome duplication circumvents constraint relaxes dichotomy resulting expanded functional scope gene duplication characterizing functional fate duplicate genes show duplicated genes rarely diverge respect biochemical function typically diverge respect regulatory control surprisingly paralogous modules genes rarely arise even whole-genome duplication rather gene duplication may drive modularization functional networks specialization thereby disentangling cellular systems
