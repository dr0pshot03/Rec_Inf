transport dynamics glutamate transporter homologue
glutamate transporters integral membrane proteins catalyse neurotransmitter uptake synaptic cleft cytoplasm glial cells neurons mechanism action involves transitions extracellular outward-facing intracellular inward-facing conformations whereby substrate binding sites become accessible either side membrane process proposed entail transmembrane movements three discrete transport domains within trimeric scaffold using single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer smfret imaging directly observed large-scale transport domain movements bacterial homologue glutamate transporters find individual transport domains alternate periods quiescence periods rapid transitions reminiscent bursting patterns first recorded single ion channels using patch-clamp methods propose switch dynamic mode glutamate transporters due separation transport domain trimeric scaffold precedes domain movements across bilayer spontaneous dislodging substrate-loaded transport domain approximately fold slower subsequent transmembrane movements may rate determining transport cycle
