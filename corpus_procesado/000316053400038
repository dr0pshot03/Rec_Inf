quantitative phosphoproteomics reveal mtorc1 activates de novo pyrimidine synthesis
ser-thr kinase mammalian target rapamycin mtor controls cell growth metabolism stimulating glycolysis synthesis proteins lipids understand central role mtor cell physiology used quantitative phosphoproteomics identify substrates downstream effectors two mtor complexes mtor controlled phosphorylation proteins including cad carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase aspartate transcarbamylase dihydroorotase cad catalyzes first three steps de novo pyrimidine synthesis mtorc1 indirectly phosphorylated cad-s1859 s6 kinase s6k cad-s1859 phosphorylation promoted cad oligomerization thereby stimulated de novo synthesis pyrimidines progression s phase cell cycle mammalian cells thus mtorc1 also stimulates synthesis nucleotides control cell proliferation
