distinct behavioural network correlates two interneuron types prefrontal cortex
neurons prefrontal cortex exhibit diverse behavioural correlates- observation attributed cell-type diversity link identified neuron types network behavioural functions recorded two largest genetically defined inhibitory interneuron classes perisomatically targeting parvalbumin pv dendritically targeting somatostatin som neurons- anterior cingulate cortex mice performing reward foraging task show pv subtype som neurons form functionally homogeneous populations showing double dissociation inhibitory effects behavioural correlates several events pertaining behaviour subtype som neurons selectively responded reward approach whereas pv neurons responded reward leaving encoded preceding stay duration behavioural correlates pv som neurons defined behavioural epoch decision variable important foraging whether stay leave crucial function attributed anterior cingulate cortex- furthermore pv neurons fire millisecond synchrony exerting fast powerful inhibition principal cell firing whereas inhibitory effect som neurons firing output weak variable consistent idea respectively control outputs inputs principal neurons- results suggest connection circuit-level function different interneuron types regulating flow information behavioural functions served cortical circuits moreover observations bolster hope functional response diversity behaviour can part explained cell-type diversity
