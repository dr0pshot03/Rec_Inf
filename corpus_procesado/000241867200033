global trends whole-genome duplications revealed ciliate paramecium tetraurelia
duplication entire genomes long recognized great potential evolutionary novelties mechanisms underlying resolution gene loss poorly understood show unicellular eukaryote paramecium tetraurelia ciliate nearly genes arose least three successive whole-genome duplications phylogenetic analysis indicates recent duplication coincides explosion speciation events gave rise p aurelia complex sibling species observed gene loss occurs long timescale initial massive event genes metabolic pathway protein complex common patterns gene loss highly expressed genes over-retained duplications conclusion analysis many genes maintained whole-genome duplication functional innovation gene dosage constraints
