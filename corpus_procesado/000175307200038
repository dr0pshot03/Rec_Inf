feedback soil biota contributes plant rarity invasiveness communities 
understanding relative abundance species plant communities unsolved problem- mechanisms competition resource partitioning dispersal ability predation tolerance- adequately explain relative abundance field conditions recent work suggests interactions plants soil microbes important- show interaction explains significant proportion variance relative abundance species plant communities rare plants exhibited relative decrease growth home soil pathogens chance accumulate whereas invasive plants benefited interactions mycorrhizal fungi plant species accumulate pathogens quickly maintain low densities result accumulation species-specific pathogens whereas others accumulate species-specific pathogens slowly experience negative feedback plant densities reach high levels results indicate plants different abilities influence abundance changing structure soil communities important regulator plant community structure
