clathrin regenerates synaptic vesicles endosomes
ultrafast endocytosis can retrieve single large endocytic vesicle fast ms synaptic vesicle fusion however fate large endocytic vesicles known demonstrate vesicles transition synaptic endosome one second stimulation endosome resolved coated vesicles s turn become small-diameter synaptic vesicles s stimulation disrupted clathrin function using rna interference rnai found clathrin required ultrafast endocytosis required generate synaptic vesicles endosome ultrafast endocytosis fails actin polymerization disrupted neurons stimulated room temperature instead physiological temperature absence ultrafast endocytosis synaptic vesicles retrieved directly plasma membrane clathrin-mediated endocytosis results may explain discrepancies among published experiments concerning role clathrin synaptic vesicle endocytosis
