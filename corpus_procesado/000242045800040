impact boreal forest fire climate warming
report measurements analysis boreal forest fire integrating effects greenhouse gases aerosols black carbon deposition snow sea ice postfire changes surface albedo net effect agents increase radiative forcing first year +/ watts per square meter burned area decrease radiative forcing averaged year fire cycle +/ watts per square meter multidecadal increases surface albedo larger impact fire-emitted greenhouse gases result implies future increases boreal fire may accelerate climate warming
