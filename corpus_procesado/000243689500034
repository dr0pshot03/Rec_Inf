infotaxis strategy searching without gradients
chemotactic bacteria rely local concentration gradients guide towards source nutrient local cues pointing towards location source always available macroscopic scales mixing flowing medium breaks regions high concentration random disconnected patches thus animals sensing odours air water detect intermittently patches sweep wind currents- macroscopic searcher must devise strategy movement based sporadic cues partial information propose search algorithm call infotaxis designed work conditions search process can thought acquisition information source location infotaxis information plays role similar concentration chemotaxis infotaxis strategy locally maximizes expected rate information gain demonstrate efficiency using computational model odour plume propagation experimental data mixing flows infotactic trajectories feature zigzagging casting paths similar observed flight moths proposed search algorithm relevant design olfactory robots- general idea infotaxis can applied broadly context searching sparse information
