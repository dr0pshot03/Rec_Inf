contribution stratospheric cooling satellite-inferred tropospheric temperature trends 
temperatures observed globally mid-tropospheric channel satellite-borne microwave sounding unit msu channel well inferred temperatures lower troposphere show small warming trends less k per decade refs surface temperatures based situ observations however exhibit larger warming similar to017 k per decade refs global climate models forced combined anthropogenic natural factors project increase tropospheric temperatures somewhat larger surface temperature increase6- show trends msu channel temperatures weak instrument partly records stratospheric temperatures whose large cooling trend9 offsets contributions tropospheric warming quantify stratospheric contribution msu channel temperatures using msu channel records stratospheric temperatures resulting trend reconstructed tropospheric temperatures satellite data physically consistent observed surface temperature trend tropics tropospheric warming similar to16 times surface warming expected moist adiabatic lapse rate
