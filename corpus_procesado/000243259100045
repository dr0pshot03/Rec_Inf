left-right dynein motor implicated selective chromatid segregation mouse cells 
cell division copies mouse chromosome segregated selectively randomly daughter cells depending cell type mechanism differential segregation unknown mouse left-right dynein lrd gene mutations result randomization visceral organs laterality hypothesized lrd may also function selective chromatid segregation indeed upon knock-down rna interference methods lrd depletion disrupts biased segregation lrd messenger rna presence absence correlates observed segregation patterns work supports claim lrd functions mechanism selective chromatid segregation
