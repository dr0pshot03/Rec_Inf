smad-dependent smad-independent pathways tgf-beta family signalling
transforming growth factor-beta tgf-beta proteins regulate cell function key roles development carcinogenesis intracellular effectors tgf-beta signalling smad proteins activated receptors translocate nucleus regulate transcription although pathway inherently simple combinatorial interactions heteromeric receptor smad complexes receptor-interacting smad-interacting proteins cooperation sequence-specific transcription factors allow substantial versatility diversification tgf-beta family responses signalling pathways regulate smad activation function addition tgf-beta receptors activate smad-independent pathways regulate smad signalling also allow smad-independent tgf-beta responses
