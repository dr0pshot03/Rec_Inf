lost found dark matter elliptical galaxies 
strong evidence mass universe dominated dark matter exerts gravitational attraction whose exact nature unknown particular galaxies believed embedded massive haloes dark matter view recently challenged observation surprisingly low random stellar velocities outskirts ordinary elliptical galaxies interpreted indicating lack dark matter show low velocities fact compatible galaxy formation dark-matter haloes using numerical simulations disk-galaxy mergers find stellar orbits outer regions resulting ellipticals elongated stars torn tidal forces original galaxies first close passage put outgoing trajectories elongated orbits combined steeply falling density profile observed tracers explain observed low velocities even presence large amounts dark matter projection effects viewing triaxial elliptical can lead even lower observed velocities along certain lines sight
