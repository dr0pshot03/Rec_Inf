predicting human interactive learning regret-driven neural networks
much human learning social context interactive nature: individual learns affected individuals learning time games represent widely accepted paradigm representing interactive decision making explored potential value neural networks modeling predicting human interactive learning repeated games found even simple learning networks driven regret based feedback accurately predict observed human behavior different experiments games unique equilibria mixed strategies introducing regret feedback dramatically improved performance neural network show regret based models provide better predictions learning established economic models
