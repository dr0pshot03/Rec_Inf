importance stirring development iron-fertilized phytoplankton bloom 
growth populations known influenced dispersal often described purely diffusive open ocean however tendrils filaments phytoplankton populations provide evidence dispersal stirring despite apparent importance horizontal stirring plankton ecology process remains poorly characterized investigate development discrete phytoplankton bloom initiated iron fertilization patch water km diameter southern ocean satellite images show striking km-long bloom near experimental site six weeks initial fertilization argue ribbon-like bloom produced fertilized patch stirring growth diffusion derive estimate stirring rate case stirring acts important control bloom development mixing phytoplankton iron patch also entraining silicate may prevented onset silicate limitation allowed bloom continue long sufficient iron stirring ocean likely variable blooms initially similar may develop differently
