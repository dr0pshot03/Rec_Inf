direct measurement reaction front chemically amplified photoresists 
continuing drive semiconductor industry fabricate smaller structures using photolithography will soon require dimensional control length scales comparable size polymeric molecules materials used pattern current technology chemically amplified photoresists uses complex reaction-diffusion process delineate patterned areas high spatial resolution however nanometer-level control critical process limited lack direct measurements reaction front demonstrate use x-ray neutron reflectometry general method measure spatial evolution reaction-diffusion process nanometer resolution measuring compositional profiles provided deuterium-labeled reactant groups neutron scattering contrast show reaction front within material broad rather sharply defined compositional profile altered development measuring density profile directly correlate developed film structure reaction front
