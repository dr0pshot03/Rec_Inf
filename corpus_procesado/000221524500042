disulfide-dependent multimeric assembly resistin family hormones
resistin founding member resistin-like molecule relm hormone family secreted selectively adipocytes induces liver-specific antagonism insulin action thus providing potential molecular link obesity diabetes crystal structures resistin relmbeta reveal unusual multimeric structure protomer comprises carboxy-terminal disulfide-rich beta-sandwich head domain amino-terminal alpha-helical tail segment alpha-helical segments associate form three-stranded coiled coils surface-exposed interchain disulfide linkages mediate formation tail-to-tail hexamers analysis serum samples shows resistin circulates two distinct assembly states likely corresponding hexamers trimers infusion resistin mutant lacking intertrimer disulfide bonds pancreatic-insulin clamp studies reveals substantially potent effects hepatic insulin sensitivity observed wildtype resistin result suggests processing intertrimer disulfide bonds may reflect obligatory step toward activation
