transformation olfactory representations drosophila antennal lobe
molecular genetics revealed precise stereotypy projection primary olfactory sensory neurons onto secondary neurons major challenge understand mapping translates odor responses second-order neurons investigated question drosophila using whole-cell recordings vivo observe monomolecular odors generally elicit responses large ensembles antennal lobe neurons comparison odor-evoked activity afferents postsynaptic neurons glomerulus revealed second-order neurons display broader tuning complex responses primary afferents indicates major transformation odor representations implicating lateral interactions within antennal lobe
