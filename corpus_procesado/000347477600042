heat released catalytic turnover enhances diffusion enzyme
recent studies shown diffusivity enzymes increases substrate-dependent manner catalysis although observation reported characterized several different systems- precise origin phenomenon unknown calorimetric methods often used determine enthalpies enzyme-catalysed reactions can therefore provide important insight reaction mechanisms ensemble averages involved traditional bulk calorimetry probe transient effects energy exchanged reaction may catalyst obtain single-molecule fluorescence correlation spectroscopy data analyse within framework stochastic theory demonstrate mechanistic link enhanced diffusion single enzyme molecule heat released reaction propose heat released catalysis generates asymmetric pressure wave results differential stress protein-solvent interface transiently displaces centre-of-mass enzyme chemoacoustic effect novel perspective enzymes respond energy released catalysis suggests possible effect heat reaction structural integrity internal degrees freedom enzyme
