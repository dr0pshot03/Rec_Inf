direct observation base-pair stepping rna polymerase 
transcription rna polymerase rnap moves processively along dna template creating complementary rna present development ultra-stable optical trapping system angstrom-level resolution used monitor transcriptional elongation single molecules escherichia coli rnap records showed discrete steps averaging +/ angstrom distance equivalent mean rise per base found b-dna combining results quantitative gel analysis conclude rnap advances along dna single base pair per nucleotide addition nascent rna also determined force-velocity relationship transcription saturating sub-saturating nucleotide concentrations; fits data returned characteristic distance parameter equivalent one base pair global fits inconsistent model movement incorporating power stroke tightly coupled pyrophosphate release consistent brownian ratchet model incorporating secondary ntp binding site
