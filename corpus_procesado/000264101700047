rsy local inhibitor presynaptic assembly c elegans
fundamental units neuronal communication chemical synapses composed presynaptic postsynaptic specializations form specific locations defined shape size synaptic assembly must tightly regulated prevent overgrowth synapse size number molecular mechanisms inhibit synapse assembly poorly understood identified regulator synaptogenesis rsy- evolutionarily conserved molecule locally antagonized presynaptic assembly loss rsy caenorhabditis elegans led formation extra synapses recruitment excessive synaptic material presynaptic sites rsy directly interacted negatively regulated syd-/liprin-alpha master assembly molecule recruits numerous synaptic components presynaptic sites rsy also bound regulated syd- synaptic protein required proper functioning syd- thus local inhibitory mechanisms govern synapse formation
