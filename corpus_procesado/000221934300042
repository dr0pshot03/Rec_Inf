phospholipid metabolism regulated transcription factor sensing phosphatidic acid 
cells regulate biophysical properties membranes coordinated synthesis different classes lipids identified highly dynamic feedback mechanism budding yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae can regulate phospholipid biosynthesis phosphatidic acid endoplasmic reticulum directly bound soluble transcriptional repressor opi1p maintain inactive outside nucleus addition lipid precursor inositol phosphatidic acid rapidly consumed releasing opi1p endoplasmic reticulum allowing nuclear translocation repression target genes thus phosphatidic acid appears essential ubiquitous metabolic intermediate signaling lipid
