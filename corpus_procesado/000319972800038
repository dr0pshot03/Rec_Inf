switch topological domains underlies hoxd genes collinearity mouse limbs 
hox genes major determinants animal body plan organize structures along trunk appendicular axes mouse limb development hoxd genes transcribed two waves: early arm forearm specified later digits form transition early late regulations involves functional switch two opposite topological domains switch reflected subset hoxd genes mapping centrally cluster initially interact telomeric domain subsequently swing toward centromeric domain establish new contacts transition independent regulatory landscapes illustrates modularity limbs distinct evolutionary histories various pieces also allows formation intermediate area low hox proteins content develops wrist transition arms hands regulatory strategy accounts collinear hox gene regulation land vertebrate appendages
