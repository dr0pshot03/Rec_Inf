virtual screening uses computer-based methods discover new ligands basis biological structures although widely heralded 1970s 1980s technique since struggled meet initial promise drug discovery remains dominated empirical screening recent successes predicting new ligands receptor-bound structures better rates ligand discovery compared empirical screening re-ignited interest virtual screening now widely used drug discovery albeit limited scale empirical screening
