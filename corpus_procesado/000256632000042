ultrasonic frogs show hyperacute phonotaxis female courtship calls
sound communication plays vital role frog reproduction vocal advertisement generally domain males females typically silent anuran species can produce feeble reciprocal call rapping sounds courtship males concave eared torrent frogs odorrana tormota demonstrated ultrasonic communication capacity although females o tormota unusually well developed vocal production system unclear whether produce calls passive partners communication system dominated males show ovulation gravid females o tormota emit calls distinct males advertisement calls higher fundamental frequencies harmonics shorter call duration field quiet darkened indoor arena female calls evoke vocalizations extraordinarily precise positive phonotaxis localization error < degrees rivalling vertebrates highest localization acuity barn owls dolphins elephants humans localization accuracy o tormota remarkable light small head size interaural distance < cm suggests additional selective advantage high frequency hearing beyond ability avoid masking low frequency background noise
