structural basis transfer rna mimicry conformational plasticity viral rna
rna arguably functionally diverse biological macromolecule cases single discrete rna sequence performs multiple roles can conferred complex three-dimensional structure multifunctionality can also driven enhanced ability given rna assume different conformational therefore functional states despite biological importance detailed structural understanding paradigm rna structure-driven multifunctionality lacking address gap useful study examples single-stranded positive-sense rna viruses prototype trna-like structure tls found end turnip yellow mosaic virus tymv tls acts like trna drive aminoacylation viral genomic grna- also interacts structures untranslated region grna contains promoter negative-strand synthesis influences several infection-critical processes tls rna can provide glimpse structural basis rna multifunctionality plasticity decades high-resolution structure remained elusive present crystal structure complete tymv tls angstrom resolution globally rna adopts shape mimics trna uses different set intramolecular interactions achieve shape interactions also allow tls readily switch conformations addition tls structure two faced: one face closely mimics trna drives aminoacylation face diverges trna enables additional functionality tls thus structured perform several functions interact diverse binding partners demonstrate ability specifically bind ribosomes
