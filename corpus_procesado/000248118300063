delayed ageing damage protection arf/p53 pathway
tumour-suppressor pathway formed alternative reading frame protein cdkn2a locus arf p53 also called trp53 plays central part detection elimination cellular damage constitutes basis potent cancer protection activity similar cancer ageing also results accumulation damage therefore reasoned arf/p53 anti-ageing activity alleviating load age-associated damage show genetically manipulated mice increased otherwise normally regulated levels arf p53 present strong cancer resistance decreased levels ageing-associated damage observations extend protective role arf/p53 ageing revealing previously unknown anti-ageing mechanism providing rationale co-evolution cancer resistance longevity
