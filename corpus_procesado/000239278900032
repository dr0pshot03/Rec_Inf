control detection chemical reactions microfluidic systems
recent years seen considerable progress development microfabricated systems use chemical biological sciences much development driven need perform rapid measurements small sample volumes however primary level interest miniaturized analytical systems stimulated fact physical processes can easily controlled harnessed instrumental dimensions reduced micrometre scale systems define new operational paradigms provide predictions molecular synthesis might revolutionized fields high-throughput synthesis chemical production
