fast synaptic subcortical control hippocampal circuits 
cortical information processing state-dependent control subcortical neuromodulatory systems although modulatory effect thought mediated mainly slow nonsynaptic metabotropic receptors mechanisms direct synaptic transmission possible yet currently unknown form subcortical control exists present direct evidence strong spatiotemporally precise excitatory input ascending neuromodulatory center selective stimulation serotonergic median raphe neurons produced rapid activation hippocampal interneurons network level subcortical drive manifested pattern effective disynaptic gabaergic inhibition spread throughout circuit form subcortical network regulation incorporated current concepts normal pathological cortical function
