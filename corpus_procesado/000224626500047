stable low-pressure hydrogen clusters stored binary clathrate hydrate 
thermodynamic x-ray diffraction raman nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy measurements show clusters h can stabilized stored low pressures sll binary clathrate hydrate clusters h molecules occupy small water cages whereas large water cages singly occupied tetrahydrofuran presence second guest component stabilizes clathrate pressures megapascals kelvin versus megapascals kelvin pure h hydrate
