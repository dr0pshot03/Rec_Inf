cortical representations olfactory input trans-synaptic tracing 
mouse class olfactory receptor neurons expressing given odorant receptor convergent axonal projections two specific glomeruli olfactory bulb thereby creating odour map however unclear map represented olfactory cortex combine rabies-virus-dependent retrograde mono-trans-synaptic labelling genetics control location number type starter cortical neurons trace presynaptic neurons find individual cortical neurons receive input multiple mitral cells representing broadly distributed glomeruli different cortical areas represent olfactory bulb input differently example cortical amygdala preferentially receives dorsal olfactory bulb input whereas piriform cortex samples whole olfactory bulb without obvious bias differences probably reflect different functions cortical areas mediating innate odour preference associative memory trans-synaptic labelling method described widely applicable mapping connections throughout mouse nervous system
