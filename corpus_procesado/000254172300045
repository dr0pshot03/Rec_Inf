drosophila egg-laying site selection system study simple decision-making processes
ability select better option multiple acceptable ones important animals optimize resources mechanisms underlie decision making processes well understood found selection egg laying site drosophila melanogaster suitable system probe neural circuit governs simple decision making processes first drosophila females pursue active probing environment depositing egg apparently evaluate site quality every egg second drosophila females can either accept reject sucrose containing medium depending context last communication acceptability sucrose containing medium egg laying option reproductive system depends function group insulin like peptide ilp7 producing neurons findings suggest selection egg laying site involves simple decision making process provide entry point toward systematic dissection process
