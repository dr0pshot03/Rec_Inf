fgf8 morphogen gradient forms source-sink mechanism freely diffusing molecules
widely accepted tissue differentiation morphogenesis multicellular organisms regulated tightly controlled concentration gradients morphogens exactly gradients formed however remains unclear- show fgf8 morphogen gradients living zebrafish embryos established andmaintained two essential factors: fast free diffusion single molecules away source extracellular space sink function receiving cells regulated receptor-mediated endocytosis evidence provided directly examining single molecules fgf8 living tissue fluorescence correlation spectroscopy quantifying local mobility concentration high precision changing degree uptake fgf8 target cells able alter shape fgf8 gradient results demonstrate freely diffusing morphogen can set concentration gradients complex multicellular tissue simple source-sink mechanism
