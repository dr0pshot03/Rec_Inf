sirna pathway prevents transgenerational retrotransposition plants subjected stress 
eukaryotic genomes consist significant extent retrotransposons suppressed host epigenetic mechanisms preventing uncontrolled propagation however clear achieved show arabidopsis seedlings subjected heat stress copia-type retrotransposon named onsen japanese hot spring became transcriptionally active also synthesized extrachromosomal dna copies heat-induced onsen accumulation stimulated mutants impaired biogenesis small interfering rnas sirnas however evidence transposition occurring vegetative tissues stress onsen transcripts extrachromosomal dna gradually decayed longer detected days surprisingly high frequency new onsen insertions observed progeny stressed plants deficient sirnas insertion patterns revealed transgenerational retrotransposition occurred flower development gametogenesis therefore plants compromised sirna biogenesis memory stress maintained throughout development priming onsen transpose differentiation generative organs retrotransposition observed progeny wild-type plants subjected stress non-stressed mutant controls pointing crucial role sirna pathway restricting retrotransposition triggered environmental stress finally found natural experimentally induced variants onsen insertions confer heat responsiveness nearby genes therefore mobility bursts may generate novel stress-responsive regulatory gene networks
