odorant receptor gene choice reset nuclear transfer mouse olfactory sensory neurons 
odorant receptor genes mouse genome olfactory sensory neuron osn thought express one gene one allele reminiscent immunoglobulin t-cell receptor genes undergo dna rearrangements lymphocytes test hypothesis gene choice controlled dna rearrangements osns using permanent genetic marking show choice osn express allele gene m71 irreversible using m71-expressing osns donors nuclear transfer generate blastocysts embryonic stem ntes cell lines clonal mice dna analysis cell lines whose genome clonally derived m71-expressing osn reveal dna rearrangements sequence alterations m71 locus osns differentiate ntes cells injection blastocysts restricted expression m71 can express genes thus m71 gene choice irreversible reset upon nuclear transfer accompanied genomic alterations
