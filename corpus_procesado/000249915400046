toward direct measurement atmospheric nucleation 
atmospheric aerosol formation known occur almost world importance particles climate air quality recognized although almost processes driving aerosol formation take place particle diameter nanometers observations cover larger particles introduce instrumental setup measure atmospheric concentrations neutral charged nanometer-sized clusters applying instruments field come three important conclusions: pool numerous neutral clusters sub nanometer size range continuously present ii processes initiating atmospheric aerosol formation start particle sizes similar nanometers iii neutral nucleation dominates ion-induced mechanism least boreal forest conditions
