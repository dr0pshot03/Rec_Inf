structural basis long-term potentiation single dendritic spines 
dendritic spines pyramidal neurons cerebral cortex undergo activity-dependent structural remodelling1- proposed cellular basis learning memory6 structural remodelling supports synaptic plasticity45 long-term potentiation7 whether plasticity input-specific level individual spine remained unknown investigated structural basis long-term potentiation using two-photon photolysis caged glutamate single spines hippocampal ca1 pyramidal neurons8 show repetitive quantum-like photorelease uncaging glutamate induces rapid selective enlargement stimulated spines transient large mushroom spines persistent small spines spine enlargement associated increase ampa-receptor-mediated currents stimulated synapse dependent nmda receptors calmodulin actin polymerization long-lasting spine enlargement also requires ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase ii results thus indicate spines individually follow hebbs postulate learning suggest small spines preferential sites long-term potentiation induction whereas large spines might represent physical traces long-term memory
