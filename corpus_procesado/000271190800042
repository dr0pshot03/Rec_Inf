gamma-ray burst redshift z approximate 
long-duration gamma-ray bursts grbs thought result explosions certain massive stars1 bright enough observable redshifts z > using current technology2- hitherto highest redshift measured object z lyman-alpha emitting galaxy5 report grb lies redshift z approximate implying massive stars produced dying grbs similar myr big bang burst also pinpoints location host galaxy
