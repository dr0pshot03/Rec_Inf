difference direct charge-parity violation charged neutral b meson decays
equal amounts matter antimatter predicted produced big bang observable universe clearly matter dominated one prerequisites understanding elimination antimatter nonconservation charge parity cp symmetry far two types cp violation observed neutral k meson k- b meson b- systems: cp violation involving mixing k antiparticle k bar likewise b b bar direct cp violation decay meson- observed effects types cp violation substantially larger b meson system however still consistent standard model particle physics unique source cp violation known small account matter-dominated universe report direct cp violation charged b-+/ -> k-+/ pi decay different neutral b counterpart direct cp violating decay rate asymmetry ak+/ pi difference number observed b -> k pi event versus b+ -> k+ pi events normalized sum events measured +% uncertainty reduced factor previous measurement however asymmetry ak+/- p-/+ b -> k pi+ versus b -> k+ pi- % level although susceptible strong interaction effects need clarification large deviation direct cp violation charged neutral b meson decays indication new sources cp violation help explain dominance matter universe
