strengthening materials engineering coherent internal boundaries nanoscale 
strengthening materials traditionally involves controlled creation internal defects boundaries obstruct dislocation motion strategies invariably compromise ductility ability material deform stretch change shape permanently without breaking outline approach optimize strength ductility identifying three essential structural characteristics boundaries: coherency surrounding matrix thermal mechanical stability smallest feature size finer nanometers assess current understanding strengthening propose methodology engineering coherent nanoscale internal boundaries specifically involving nanoscale twin boundaries additionally discuss perspectives strengthening preserving ductility along potential applications improving failure tolerance electrical conductivity resistance electromigration
