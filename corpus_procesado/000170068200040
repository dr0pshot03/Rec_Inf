magnetic reconnection process magnetic field lines opposite polarity reconfigure lower-energy state release magnetic energy surroundings reconnection earths dayside magnetopause magnetotail allows solar wind magnetosphere begins small `diffusion region kink newly reconnected lines produces jets plasma away region although plasma jets reconnection previously reported- physical processes underlie jet formation remained poorly understood scarcity situ observations minuscule diffusion region theoretically resistive collisionless processes can initiate reconnection- process dominates magnetosphere still debated report serendipitous encounter wind spacecraft active reconnection diffusion region detected key processes predicted models- collisionless reconnection data therefore demonstrate collisionless reconnection occurs magnetotail
