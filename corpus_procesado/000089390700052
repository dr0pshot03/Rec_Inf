protein aly links pre-messenger-rna splicing nuclear export metazoans 
metazoans pre-messenger rnas contain introns removed splicing spliced mrnas exported cytoplasm recent studies showed splicing promotes efficient mrna export mechanism coupling two processes known show aly metazoan homologue yeast mrna export factor yra1p ref recruited messenger ribonucleoprotein mrnp complexes generated splicing contrast aly associate mrnps assembled identical mrnas already introns heterogenous nuclear rnp hnrnp complexes aly recruited spliceosome assembly becomes tightly associated spliced mrnp aly shuttles nucleus cytoplasm excess recombinant aly increases rate efficiency mrna export vivo consistent splicing-dependent recruitment aly co-localizes splicing factors nucleus conclude splicing required efficient mrna export result coupling splicing mrna export machineries
