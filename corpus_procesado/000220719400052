neuronal activity related reward value motivation primate frontal cortex 
several areas macaque brain neurons re delayed-response tasks rate determined value reward expected end trial activity neurons might related value expected reward degree motivation induced expectation reward describe results indicating nature reward-dependent activity varies across areas neuronal activity orbitofrontal cortex represents value expected reward whereas neuronal activity premotor cortex reflects degree motivation
