archimedean-like tiling decagonal quasicrystalline surfaces
monolayers crystalline surfaces often form complex structures physical chemical properties differ strongly bulk phases hetero-epitactic overlayers currently used nanotechnology understanding growth mechanism important development new materials devices comparison crystals quasicrystalline surfaces exhibit much larger structural chemical complexity leading example unusual frictional catalytical optical properties deposition thin films substrates can lead structures may typical quasicrystalline properties recent experiments indeed showed fold symmetries diffraction pattern metallic layers adsorbed quasicrystals report real-space investigation phase behaviour colloidal monolayer interacting quasicrystalline decagonal substrate created interfering five laser beams find pseudomorphic phase shows crystalline quasicrystalline structural properties can described archimedean-like tiling consisting alternating rows square triangular tiles calculated diffraction pattern phase agreement recent observations copper adsorbed icosahedral alpdmn surfaces addition establishing link archimedean tilings quasicrystals experiments allow us investigate real space single-element monolayers can form commensurate structures quasicrystalline surfaces
