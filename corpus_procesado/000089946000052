natural selection reinforcement mate recognition
natural selection mate recognition may often contribute speciation resulting reproductive character displacement field populations drosophila serrata display reproductive character displacement cuticular hydrocarbons sympatric drosophila birchii exposed field sympatric allopatric populations d serrata experimental sympatry d birchii nine generations cuticular hydrocarbons field allopatric d serrata populations evolved resemble field sympatric populations whereas field sympatric d serrata populations remained unchanged experiment indicates natural selection mate recognition resulted field pattern reproductive character displacement
