female germ cell aneuploidy embryo death mice lacking meiosis-specific protein scp3 
aneuploidy trisomy monosomy leading genetic cause pregnancy loss humans results errors meiotic chromosome segregation show absence synaptonemal complex protein scp3 promotes aneuploidy murine oocytes inducing defective meiotic chromosome segregation abnormal oocyte karyotype inherited embryos die utero early stage development addition embryo death scp3-deficient females increases advancing maternal age found scp3 required chiasmata formation structural integrity meiotic chromosomes suggesting altered chromosomal structure triggers nondisjunction scp3 thus linked inherited aneuploidy female germ cells provides model system studying age-dependent degeneration oocytes
