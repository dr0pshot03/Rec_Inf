notum deacylates wnt proteins suppress signalling activity
signalling wnt proteins finely balanced ensure normal development tissue homeostasis avoiding diseases cancer achieved part notum highly conserved secreted feedback antagonist notum thought act phospholipase shedding glypicans associated wnt proteins cell surface however view fails explain specificity glypicans bind many extracellular ligands provide genetic evidence drosophila notum requires glypicans suppress wnt signalling cleave glycophosphatidylinositol anchor structural analyses reveal glycosaminoglycan binding sites notum probably help notum co-localize wnt proteins also identify active site human drosophila notum large hydrophobic pocket accommodates palmitoleate kinetic mass spectrometric analyses human proteins show notum carboxylesterase removes essential palmitoleate moiety wnt proteins thus constitutes first known extracellular protein deacylase
