fringe glycosyltransferase modifies notch 
notch receptors function highly conserved intercellular signalling pathways direct cell-fate decisions proliferation apoptosis metazoans fringe proteins can positively negatively modulate ability notch ligands activate notch receptor establish biochemical mechanism fringe action drosophila mammalian fringe proteins possess fucose-specific beta n-acetylglucosaminyltransferase activity initiates elongation o-linked fucose residues attached epidermal growth factor-like sequence repeats notch obtained biological evidence fringe-dependent elongation o-linked fucose notch modulates notch signalling using co-culture assays mammalian cells expression enzymatically inactive fringe mutant drosophila post-translational modification notch fringe represents striking example modulation signalling event differential receptor glycosylation identifies mechanism likely relevant signalling pathways
