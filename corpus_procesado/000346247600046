positional toll receptor code directs convergent extension drosophila 
elongation head-to-tail body axis convergent extension conserved developmental process throughout metazoans drosophila patterns transcription factor expression provide spatial cues induce systematically oriented cell movements promote tissue elongation however mechanisms patterned transcriptional inputs control cell polarity behaviour long elusive demonstrate three toll family receptors toll- toll- toll- expressed overlapping transverse stripes along anterior-posterior axis act combination direct planar polarity polarized cell rearrangements convergent extension simultaneous disruption three receptors strongly reduces actomyosin driven junctional remodelling axis elongation ectopic stripe toll receptor expression sufficient induce planar polarized actomyosin contractility results demonstrate tissue-level patterns toll receptor expression provide spatial signals link positional information anterior-posterior patterning system essential cell behaviours drive convergent extension
