sea urchin spine calcite forms via transient amorphous calcium carbonate phase
skeletons adult echinoderms comprise large single crystals calcite smooth convoluted fenestrated morphologies raising many questions form using water etching infrared spectroscopy electron diffraction environmental scanning electron microscopy show sea urchin spine regeneration proceeds via initial deposition amorphous calcium carbonate echinoderms produce type skeletal material probably use mechanism deposition transient amorphous phases strategy producing single crystals complex morphology may interesting implications development sophisticated materials
