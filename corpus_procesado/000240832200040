genomic evolution hox gene clusters 
family hox genes number per genome depending animal control morphologies main body axis nearly metazoans conventional wisdom hox genes arranged chromosomal clusters colinear order expression patterns body axis however recent evidence shown hox gene clusters fragmented reduced expanded many animals findings correlate interesting morphological changes evolution hox gene clusters also contain many noncoding rnas intergenic regulatory transcripts evolutionarily conserved micrornas whose developmental functions recently explored
