guest transport nonporous organic solid via dynamic van der waals cooperativity 
well-known organic host compound undergoes single-crystal single-crystal phase transitions upon guest uptake release despite lack porosity material guest transport solid occurs readily thermodynamically stable structure achieved order actively facilitate dynamic process host molecules undergo significant positional and/or orientational rearrangement transformation host lattice triggered weak van der waals interactions molecular components order material maintain macroscopic integrity extensive cooperativity must exist molecules throughout crystal rearrangement can occur well-orchestrated fashion demonstrate even weak dispersive forces can exert profound influence solid-state dynamics
