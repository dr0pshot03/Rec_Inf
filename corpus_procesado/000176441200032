nature transport mechanism hydrated hydroxide ions aqueous solution 
compared ions protons h+ hydroxide ions oh- exhibit anomalously high mobilities aqueous solutions qualitative level behaviour long explained structural diffusion-the continuous interconversion hydration complexes driven fluctuations solvation shell hydrated ions detailed investigations led clear understanding proton transport mechanism molecular level- contrast hydroxide ion mobility basic solutions received far less attention even though bases base catalysis play important roles many organic biochemical reactions chemical industry reason may attributed century-old notion hydrated oh can regarded water molecule missing proton transport mechanism proton hole can inferred excess proton simply reversing hydrogen bond polarities- however recent studies identified oh hydration complexes bear little structural similarity proton hydration complexes report solution structures transport mechanisms hydrated hydroxide obtained first-principles computer simulations explicitly treat quantum thermal fluctuations nuclei- find transport mechanism differs significantly proton hole picture involves interplay previously identified hydration complexes strongly influenced nuclear quantum effects
