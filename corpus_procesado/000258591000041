pathogen protein espfu hijacks actin polymerization using mimicry multivalency
enterohaemorrhagic escherichia coli attaches intestine actin pedestals formed bacterium injects protein espfu also known tccp host cells espfu potently activates host wasp wiskott aldrich syndrome protein family actin nucleating factors normally activated gtpase cdc42 among signalling molecules apart amino terminal type iii secretion signal espfu consists five half amino acid repeats show residue motif within espfu repeat sufficient interaction n wasp also known wasl unlike pathogen proteins interface cytoskeletal machinery motif mimic natural upstream activators: instead mimicking activated state cdc42 espfu mimics auto-nhibitory element found within n wasp thus espfu activates n wasp competitively disrupting autoinhibited state mimicking internal regulatory element natural activator espfu selectively activates precise subset cdc42 activated processes although one repeat able stimulate actin polymerization show multiple repeat fragments notably increased potency activities espfu fragments correlate ability coordinate activation least two n wasp proteins thus pathogen used simple autoinhibitory fragment component build highly effective actin polymerization machine
