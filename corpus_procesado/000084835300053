molecular evidence regarding origin echolocation flight bats 
bats order chiroptera one orders mammals echolocate group capacity powered flight order subdivided microchiroptera megachiroptera array characteristics defining group including complex laryngeal echolocation systems microbats enhanced visual acuity megabats respective monophylies two suborders tacitly assumed although microbat monophyly uncorroborated molecular data present phylogenetic analysis bat relationships using dna sequence data four nuclear genes three mitochondrial genes total base pairs indicating microbat families superfamily rhinolophoidea closely related megabats microbats implies echolocation systems either evolved independently rhinolophoids microbats lost evolution megabats data also reject flying lemur order dermoptera bat sister group indicating presumed shared derived characters flying lemurs bats convergent features evolved association gliding flight respectively
