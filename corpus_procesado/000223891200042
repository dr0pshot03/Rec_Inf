activation endogenous cdc42 visualized living cells 
signaling proteins tightly regulated spatially temporally perform multiple functions cdc42 guanosine triphosphatases subcellular location activation critical determinant cell behavior however current approaches limited ability examine dynamics cdc42 activity living cells report development biosensor capable visualizing changing activation endogenous unlabeled cdc42 living cells use dye reports protein interactions biosensor revealed localized activation trans-golgi apparatus microtubule-dependent cdc42 activation cell periphery activation kinetics precisely coordinated cell extension retraction
