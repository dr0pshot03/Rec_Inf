src mediates switch microtubule actin-based motility vaccinia virus
cascade events leads vaccinia-induced actin polymerization requires src-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation viral membrane protein a36r found localized outside-in signaling cascade induced viral membrane protein b5r required potently activate src induce a36r phosphorylation plasma membrane addition src-mediated phosphorylation a36r regulated ability virus particles recruit release conventional kinesin thus src activity regulates transition cytoplasmic microtubule transport actin-based motility plasma membrane
