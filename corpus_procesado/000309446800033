two stellar-mass black holes globular cluster m22 
hundreds stellar-mass black holes probably form typical globular star cluster one predicted ejected dynamical interactions- observational support idea provided lack x-ray-emitting binary stars comprising one black hole one star black-hole/x-ray binaries milky way globular clusters even though many neutron-star/x-ray binaries known although black holes seen globular clusters around galaxies masses determined may intermediate-mass black holes form exotic mechanisms report presence two flat-spectrum radio sources milky way globular cluster m22 argue objects black holes stellar mass similar times massive sun accreting matter find high ratio radio-to-x-ray flux black holes consistent larger predicted masses black holes globular clusters compared outside identification two black holes one cluster shows ejection black holes efficient predicted models argue m22 may contain total population similar black holes large core radius m22 arise heating produced black holes
