trpv family ion channel required hearing drosophila
many types insect ear share common sensory element chordotonal organ sound-induced antennal tympanal vibrations transmitted ciliated sensory neurons transduced receptor potentials however molecular identity transducing ion channels chordotonal neurons auditory system still unknown drosophila mutant nompc transient receptor potential trp superfamily ion channel lack receptor potentials currents tactile bristles retain antennal sound-evoked response suggesting different channel primary transducer chordotonal organs describe drosophila nanchung nan protein ion channel subunit similar vanilloid-receptor-related trpv channels trp superfamily nan mediates hypo-osmotically activated calcium influx cation currents cultured cells expressed vivo exclusively chordotonal neurons localized sensory cilia antennal sound-evoked potentials completely absent mutants lacking nan showing essential component chordotonal mechanotransducer
