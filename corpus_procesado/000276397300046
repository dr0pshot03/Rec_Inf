kinetics two-dimensional tcr pmhc interactions determine t-cell responsiveness 
t-cell receptor tcr interacts peptide-major histocompatibility complexes pmhc discriminate pathogens self-antigens trigger adaptive immune responses direct physical contact required t cell antigen-presenting cell cross-junctional binding tcr pmhc anchored two-dimensional 2d membranes apposing cells despite 2d nature tcr-pmhc binding kinetics analysed three-dimensionally 3d varying degree correlation t-cell responsiveness- use two mechanical assays show high 2d affinities tcr antigenic pmhc driven rapid on-rates compared 3d counterparts 2d affinities on-rates tcr panel pmhc ligands possess far broader dynamic ranges match corresponding t-cell responses best 3d predictor response off-rate agonist pmhc dissociating slowest- contrast 2d off-rates -fold faster agonist pmhc dissociating fastest 2d data suggest rapid antigen sampling t cells serial engagement agonist pmhcs tcrs large self pmhc background thus cellular environment amplifies intrinsic tcr-pmhc binding generate broad affinities rapid kinetics determine t-cell responsiveness
