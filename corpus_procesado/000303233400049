gbp5 promotes nlrp3 inflammasome assembly immunity mammals
inflammasomes sensory complexes alert immune system presence infection tissue damage complexes assemble nlr nucleotide binding oligomerization leucine-rich repeat alr absent melanoma like receptor proteins activate caspase cleavage interleukin il beta/il secretion identified non-nlr/alr human protein stimulates inflammasome assembly: guanylate binding protein gbp5 gbp5 promoted selective nlrp3 inflammasome responses pathogenic bacteria soluble crystalline inflammasome priming agents generation gbp5-/- mice revealed pronounced caspase il beta/il cleavage defects vitro impaired host defense nlrp3-dependent inflammatory responses vivo thus gbp5 serves unique rheostat nlrp3 inflammasome activation extends understanding inflammasome complex beyond core machinery
