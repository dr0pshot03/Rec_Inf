cd8 alpha alpha-mediated survival differentiation cd8 memory t cell precursors
memory t cells long-lived antigen-experienced t cells generally accepted direct descendants proliferating primary effector cells however factors permit selective survival t cells well established show homodimeric alpha chains cd8 molecule cd8alphaalpha transiently induced selected subset cd8alphabeta+ t cells upon antigenic stimulation cd8alphaalpha molecules promote survival differentiation activated lymphocytes memory cd8 t cells thus memory precursors can identified among primary effector cells selected survival differentiation cd8alphaalpha
