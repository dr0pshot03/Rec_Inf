quantum versus classical annealing ising spin glasses
quantum annealers use quantum fluctuations escape local minima find low-energy configurations physical system strong evidence superiority quantum annealing qa come comparing qa implemented quantum monte carlo qmc simulations classical annealing motivated recent experiments revisit question quantum speedup may expected although better scaling seen qa two-dimensional ising spin glasses advantage due time discretization artifacts measurements possible physical quantum annealer simulations physically relevant continuous time limit hand show superiority results imply care must taken using qmc simulations assess potential quantum speedup
