non-classical receptive field mediates switch sensory neurons frequency tuning 
animals developed stereotyped communication calls specific sensory neurons well tuned communication calls must discriminated environmental signals produced prey sensory systems might evolved neural circuitry encode categories weakly electric fish prey communication signals differ spatial extent frequency content show stimuli different spatial extents mimicking prey communication signals cause switch frequency tuning spike-timing precision electrosensory pyramidal neurons resulting selective optimal encoding stimulus categories sensory systems pyramidal neurons respond stimuli located within restricted region space known classical receptive field crf systems stimulation outside crf within non-classical receptive field ncrf can modulate neural response crf stimulation even though ncrf stimulation alone fails elicit responses show pyramidal neurons possess ncrf can modulate response crf stimuli induce neurobiological switch frequency tuning
