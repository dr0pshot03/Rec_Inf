photonic quantum information interface
quantum communication requires transfer quantum states quantum bits information qubits one place another fundamental perspective allows distribution entanglement demonstration quantum non-locality significant distances- within context applications quantum cryptography offers provably secure way establish confidential key distant partners photons represent natural flying qubit carriers quantum communication presence telecommunications optical fibres makes wavelengths nm nm particularly suitable distribution long distances however qubits encoded alkaline atoms absorb emit wavelengths around nm considered storage processing quantum information hence future quantum information networks made telecommunications channels alkaline memories will require interfaces enable qubit transfers useful wavelengths preserving quantum coherence entanglement- report demonstration qubit transfer photons wavelength nm nm mechanism nonlinear up-conversion process success probability greater per cent event successful qubit transfer observe strong two-photon interference nm photon third photon nm initially entangled nm photon although never directly interacted corresponding fidelity higher per cent
