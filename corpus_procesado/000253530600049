transgenic inhibition synaptic transmission reveals role ca3 output hippocampal learning
hippocampus area brain involved learning memory contains parallel excitatory pathways referred trisynaptic pathway carries information follows: entorhinal cortex -> dentate gyrus -> ca3 -> ca1 -> entorhinal cortex monosynaptic pathway entorhinal cortex -> ca1 -> entorhinal cortex developed generally applicable tetanus toxin based method transgenic mice permits inducible reversible inhibition synaptic transmission applied trisynaptic pathway preserving transmission monosynaptic pathway found synaptic output ca3 trisynaptic pathway dispensable short monosynaptic pathway sufficient incremental spatial learning contrast full trisynaptic pathway containing ca3 required rapid one trial contextual learning pattern completion based memory recall spatial tuning ca1 cells
