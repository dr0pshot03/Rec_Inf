molecular genomic data identify closest living relative primates
full understanding primate morphological genomic evolution requires identification closest living relative order resolve ancestral relationships among primates closest relatives searched multispecies genome alignments phylogenetically informative rare genomic changes within superordinal group euarchonta includes orders primates dermoptera colugos scandentia treeshrews also constructed phylogenetic trees kilobases nuclear genes representatives major primate lineages extant colugos multiple treeshrews including pentail treeshrew ptilocercus lowii living member family ptilocercidae relaxed molecular clock analysis including ptilocercus suggests treeshrews arose approximately million years ago data show colugos closest living relatives primates indicate divergence occurred cretaceous
