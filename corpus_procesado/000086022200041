towards clarity limit optical fibre 
important scientific technological goal- held optical communications achievement clarity limit optical fibres-that ensuring sio2 glass fibres made transparent possible clarity wavelength transmission window width window existing fibres already sufficient form basis world-wide optical communication system yet still limited contamination fibre water measure spatial distribution water glass rods optical fibres drawn explain distribution quantitatively mathematical model diffusion medium essentially perfect cylindrical symmetry analysis shows water enters outside rod diffuses molten flowing glass much faster expected extrapolation low-temperature measurements elucidation physics underlying contamination process already led fabrication dry fibres clarified broadened communications window improved operational range wavelengths yield applications new lasers optical amplifiers detectors substantially increase information-carrying capacity optical communications systems
