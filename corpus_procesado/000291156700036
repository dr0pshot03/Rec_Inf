thermodynamic meaning negative entropy
heat generated computations obstacle circuit miniaturization also fundamental aspect relationship information theory thermodynamics principle reversible operations may performed energy cost given irreversible computations can always decomposed reversible operations followed erasure data problem calculating energy cost reduced study erasure landauers principle states erasure data stored system inherent work cost therefore dissipates heat- however consideration assumes information system erased classical extend general case observer may quantum information system erased instance means quantum memory entangled system show standard formulation implications landauers principle longer valid presence quantum information main result work cost erasure determined entropy system conditioned quantum information observer words observer knows system less costs erase result gives direct thermodynamic significance conditional entropies originally introduced information theory furthermore provides new bounds heat generation computations: conditional entropies can become negative quantum case observer strongly correlated system may gain work erasing thereby cooling environment
