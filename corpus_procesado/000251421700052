ketamine-induced loss phenotype fast-spiking interneurons mediated nadph-oxidase
abuse dissociative anesthetic ketamine can lead syndrome indistinguishable schizophrenia animals repetitive exposure n-methyl-d-aspartate-receptor antagonist induces dysfunction subset cortical fast-spiking inhibitory interneurons loss expression parvalbumin gamma-aminobutyric acid-producing enzyme gad67 show exposure mice ketamine induced persistent increase brain superoxide due activation neurons reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate nadph oxidase decreasing superoxide production prevented effects ketamine inhibitory interneurons prefrontal cortex results suggest nadph oxidase may represent novel target treatment ketamine-induced psychosis
