proteomics study genes genomes 
proteomics large-scale analysis proteins will contribute greatly understanding gene function post-genomic era proteomics can divided three main areas: protein micro-characterization large-scale identification proteins post-translational modifications differential display proteomics comparison protein levels potential application wide range diseases studies protein-protein interactions using techniques mass spectrometry yeast two-hybrid system often difficult predict function protein based homology proteins even three-dimensional structure determination components protein complex cellular structure central functional analysis aspect proteomic studies perhaps area greatest promise revolution molecular biology exemplified ease cloning dna methods proteomics will add understanding biochemistry proteins processes pathways years come
