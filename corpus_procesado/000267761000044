unlimited multistability multisite phosphorylation systems
reversible phosphorylation serine threonine tyrosine widely studied posttranslational modification proteins number phosphorylated sites protein n shows significant increase prokaryotes n < sites eukaryotes examples n > sites multisite phosphorylation many roles site conservation indicates increasing numbers sites due merely promiscuous phosphorylation substrate n sites exponential number n phospho-forms individual phospho-forms may distinct biological effects distribution phospho-forms distribution regulated remained unknown show kinase phosphatase act opposition multisite substrate system can exhibit distinct stable phospho-form distributions steady state maximum number distributions increases n whereas stable distributions focused single phospho-form others diffuse giving phosphoproteome potential behave fluid regulatory network able encode information flexibly respond varying demands plasticity may underlie complex information processing eukaryotic cells suggests functional advantage many sites results follow unusual geometry steady-state phospho-form concentrations show constitute rational algebraic curve irrespective n thereby reduce complexity calculating steady states simulating x n differential equations solving two algebraic equations treating parameters symbolically anticipate methods can extended systems multiple substrates multiple enzymes catalysing different modifications found posttranslational modification codes histone code whereas simulations struggle exponentially increasing molecular complexity mathematical methods kind developed can provide new language articulate principles cellular information processing
