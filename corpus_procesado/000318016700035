vaterite crystals contain two interspersed crystal structures 
calcite aragonite vaterite three anhydrous polymorphs calcium carbonate order decreasing thermodynamic stability although vaterite commonly found geological settings important precursor several carbonate-forming systems can found biological settings difficulties obtaining large pure single crystals crystal structure vaterite elusive almost century using aberration-corrected high-resolution transmission electron microscopy found vaterite actually composed least two different crystallographic structures coexist within pseudo-single crystal major structure exhibits hexagonal symmetry minor structure existing nanodomains within major matrix still unknown
