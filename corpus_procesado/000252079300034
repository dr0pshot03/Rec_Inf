behavioural report single neuron stimulation somatosensory cortex 
understanding neural activity sensory cortices relates perception central theme neuroscience action potentials sensory cortical neurons can strongly correlated properties sensory stimuli reflect subjective judgements individual stimuli microstimulation experiments established direct link sensory activity behaviour suggesting small neuronal populations can influence sensory decisions however microstimulation allow identification quantification stimulated cellular elements sensory impact individual cortical neurons therefore remains unknown show stimulation single neurons somatosensory cortex affects behavioural responses detection task trained rats respond microstimulation barrel cortex low current intensities initiated short trains action potentials single neurons juxtacellular stimulation animals responded significantly often single cell stimulation trials catch trials without stimulation stimulation effects varied greatly cells average % trials response induced whereas stimulation putative excitatory neurons led weak biases towards responding stimulation putative inhibitory neurons led variable stronger sensory effects reaction times single cell stimulation long variable results demonstrate single neuron activity can cause change animals detection behaviour suggesting much sparser cortical code sensations previously anticipated
