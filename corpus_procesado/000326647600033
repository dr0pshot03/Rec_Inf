epithelial plasticity: common theme embryonic cancer cells
embryonic development many cells born far final destination must travel long distances become motile invasive embryonic epithelial cells undergo process mesenchymal conversion known epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition emt likewise emt can seen cancer cells leave primary tumor disseminate parts body colonize distant organs form metastases addition reverse process mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition normal carcinoma cells revert epithelial phenotype respectively differentiate organs form secondary tumors parallels phenotypic plasticity normal morphogenesis cancer highlight importance studying embryo understand tumor progression aid design improved therapeutic strategies
