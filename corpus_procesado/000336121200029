nucleotide signalling inflammation
inflammatory conditions associated extracellular release nucleotides particularly atp extracellular compartment atp predominantly functions signalling molecule activation purinergic p2 receptors metabotropic p2y receptors g-protein-coupled whereas ionotropic p2x receptors atp-gated ion channels discuss signalling events p2 receptors alter outcomes inflammatory infectious diseases recent studies implicate role p2x/p2ysignalling mounting appropriate inflammatory responses critical host defence invading pathogens tumours conversely p2x/p2ysignalling can promote chronic inflammation ischaemia reperfusion injury inflammatory bowel disease acute chronic diseases lungs although nucleotide signalling used clinically patients research indicates expanding field opportunities specifically targeting individual p2 receptors treatment inflammatory infectious diseases
