kanadi regulates organ polarity arabidopsis
leaves floral organs polarized along adaxial-abaxial dorsal-ventral axis arabidopsis difference particularly obvious first two rosette leaves possess trichomes leaf hairs adaxial surface abaxial surface- mutant alleles kanadi kan identified screen mutants produce abaxial trichomes first two leaves kan mutations originally identified enhancers mutant floral phenotype crabs claw crc gene specifies abaxial identity carpels show kan required abaxial identity leaves carpels encodes nuclear-localized protein garp family putative transcription factors expression pattern kan messenger rna effect ectopically expressing kan regulation cauliflower mosaic virus camv 35s promoter indicate kan may also specify peripheral identity developing embryo
