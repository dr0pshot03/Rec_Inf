host resistance lung infection mediated major vault protein epithelial cells
airway epithelium plays essential role innate immunity lung pathogens ribonucleoprotein particles primarily composed major vault protein mvp highly expressed cells encounter xenobiotics however clear biologic function mvp established report mvp rapidly recruited lipid rafts human lung epithelial cells infected pseudomonas aeruginosa maximal recruitment dependent bacterial binding cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator mvp also essential optimal epithelial cell internalization clearance p aeruginosa results suggest mvp makes substantial contribution epithelial cell-mediated resistance infection
