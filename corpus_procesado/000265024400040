curved plasma channel generation using ultraintense airy beams 
plasma channel generation filamentation using ultraintense laser pulses dielectric media wide spectrum applications ranging remote sensing terahertz generation lightning control far laser filamentation triggered use ultrafast pulses axially symmetric spatial beam profiles thereby generating straight filaments report experimental observation curved plasma channels generated air using femtosecond airy beams unusual propagation regime tightly confined main intensity feature axially nonsymmetric laser beam propagates along bent trajectory leaving curved plasma channel behind secondary channels bifurcate primary bent channel several locations along beam path broadband radiation emanating different longitudinal sections curved filament propagates along angularly resolved trajectories
