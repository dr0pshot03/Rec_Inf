enantioselective heck arylations acyclic alkenyl alcohols using redox-relay strategy 
progress development asymmetric heck couplings arenes acyclic olefins limited tenuous understanding factors dictate selectivity migratory insertion beta-hydride elimination basis key mechanistic insight recently garnered exploration selective heck reactions report enantioselective variant delivers beta- gamma- delta-aryl carbonyl products acyclic alkenol substrates catalyst system imparts notable regioselectivity migratory insertion promotes migration alkenes unsaturation toward alcohol ultimately form ketone product reaction uses aryldiazonium salts arene source yields enantiomeric products opposite starting alkene configurations uses readily accessible ligand racemic nature alkenol substrate bias enantioselection
