eukaryotes accurate chromosome segregation mitosis meiosis coordinated kinetochores unique chromosomal sites microtubule attachment centromeres specify kinetochore formation sites individual chromosomes epigenetically marked assembly nucleosomes containing centromere-specific histone h3 variant cenp-a- although underlying mechanism unclear centromere inheritance probably dictated architecture centromeric nucleosome report crystal structure human centromeric nucleosome containing cenp-a cognate alpha-satellite dna derivative base pairs human cenp-a nucleosome dna wrapped around histone octamer consisting two histones h2a h2b h4 cenp-a left-handed orientation however unlike canonical h3 nucleosome central base pairs dna visible thirteen base pairs ends dna invisible crystal structure alpha n helix cenp-a shorter h3 known important orientation dna ends canonical h3 nucleosome structural comparison cenp-a h3 nucleosomes revealed cenp-a contains two extra amino acid residues arg gly loop region completely exposed solvent mutations cenp-a loop residues reduced cenp-a retention centromeres human cells therefore cenp-a loop may function stabilizing centromeric chromatin containing cenp-a possibly providing binding site trans-acting factors structure provides first atomic-resolution picture centromere-specific nucleosome
