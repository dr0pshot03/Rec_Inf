peroxidase/dual oxidase system modulates midgut epithelial immunity anopheles gambiae 
extracellular matrices diverse biological systems cross-linked dityrosine covalent bonds catalyzed peroxidase/oxidase system show peroxidase secreted anopheles gambiae midgut dual oxidase form dityrosine network decreases gut permeability immune elicitors network protects microbiota preventing activation epithelial immunity also provides suitable environment malaria parasites develop within midgut lumen without inducing nitric oxide synthase expression disruption barrier results strong effective pathogen-specific immune responses
