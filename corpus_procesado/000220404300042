imaging cortical correlates illusion early visual cortex 
exploring visual illusions reveals fundamental principles cortical processing illusory motion perception non-moving stimuli described almost century ago gestalt psychologists however underlying neuronal mechanisms remain unknown explore cortical mechanisms underlying linemotion illusion used real-time optical imaging- highly sensitive subthreshold activity examined visual cortex anaesthetized cat responses five stimuli: stationary small square long bar moving square drawnout bar well-known line-motion illusion stationary square briefly preceding long stationary bar presentation whereas flashing bar alone evoked expected localized short latency high amplitude activity patterns presenting square ms bar induced dynamic activity patterns resembling fast movement preceding square even though physically non-moving created gradually propagating subthreshold cortical activity must contribute illusory motion indistinguishable cortical representations real motion area findings demonstrate effect spatio-temporal patterns subthreshold synaptic potentials cortical processing shaping perception
