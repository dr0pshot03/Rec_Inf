synthesis carbenes substitution reactions carbene center
anaminophosphino carbene can transformed intoaminophosphonio carbenes undergo nucleophilic intermolecular well intramolecular substitution reactions carbene center variety carbenes can synthesized starting single carbene precursor resulting gamut electronic steric effects possible open way detailed study mechanism also subsequent improvement catalytic reactions involve carbene-transition metal complexes
