glass transition water based hyperquenching experiments 
glass transition temperature t-g water still uncertain conflicting values reported literature hyperquenched glasses water exhibits large relaxation exotherm reheating normal rate kelvin k per minute release heat indicates transformation high enthalpy state tower one found slow-cooled glasses exotherm temperature scaled t-g good glass-formers show common pattern however hyperquenched water analysis performed using commonly accepted t-g k behavior appears completely different case enthalpy relaxation fundamental calorimetric glass transition t-g k normal behavior restored comparison hyperquenched glasses binary solution behavior network-former systems h2o zncl2 bef2 plus second component revised value relevance understanding water-biomolecule interactions
