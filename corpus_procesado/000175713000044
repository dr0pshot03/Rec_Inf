structural basis transcription initiation: rna polymerase holoenzyme angstrom resolution 
crystal structure initiating form thermus aquaticus rna polymerase containing core rna polymerase alphabetabetaomega promoter specificity subunit determined angstrom resolution important structural features rna polymerase roles positioning within initiation complex delineated well role played modulating opening rna polymerase active-site channel two carboxyl-terminal domains separated angstroms surface rna polymerase linked extended loop loop winds near rna polymerase active site may play role initiating nucleotide substrate binding rna exit channel advancing rna transcript must displace loop leading abortive initiation ultimately release
