fluorescence-force spectroscopy maps two-dimensional reaction landscape holliday junction 
despite recent advances single-molecule manipulation techniques purely mechanical approaches detect subtle conformational changes biologically important regime weak forces developed hybrid scheme combining force fluorescence allowed us examine effect subpiconewton forces nanometer scale motion holliday junction hj -hertz bandwidth hj exquisitely sensitive force sensor whose force response amplified increase arm lengths demonstrating lever-arm effect nanometer-length scale mechanical interrogation hj three different directions helped elucidate structures transient species populated conformational changes method mapping two-dimensional reaction landscapes low forces readily applicable nucleic acid systems interactions proteins enzymes
