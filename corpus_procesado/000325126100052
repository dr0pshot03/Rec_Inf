ultrathin molecular-sieving graphene oxide membranes selective hydrogen separation
ultrathin molecular-sieving membranes great potential realize high-flux high-selectivity mixture separation low energy cost current microporous membranes [pore size < nanometer nm] however usually relatively thick use current membrane materials techniques difficult prepare microporous membranes thinner nm without introducing extra defects report ultrathin graphene oxide go membranes thickness approaching nm prepared facile filtration process membranes showed mixture separation selectivities high h-/co2 h-/n mixtures respectively selective structural defects go
