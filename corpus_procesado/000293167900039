history human population size important understanding human evolution various studies- found evidence founder event bottleneck east asian european populations associated human dispersal out-of-africa event around thousand years kyr ago however studies assume simplified demographic models parameters provide precise date start stop times bottleneck fewer assumptions population size changes present detailed history human population sizes approximately ten thousand million years ago using pairwise sequentially markovian coalescent model applied complete diploid genome sequences chinese male yh korean male sjk three european individuals j c venter na12891 na12878 ref two yoruba males na18507 ref na19239 infer european chinese populations similar population-size histories kyr ago populations experienced severe bottleneck kyr ago whereas african populations experienced milder bottleneck recovered earlier three populations elevated effective population size kyr ago possibly due population substructure also infer differentiation genetically modern humans may started early kyr ago considerable genetic exchanges may still occurred kyr ago
