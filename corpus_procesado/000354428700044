microtubule detyrosination guides chromosomes mitosis 
chromosomes segregate daughter cells align mitotic spindle equator process known chromosome congression centromere-associated protein e cenp-e/kinesin- microtubule plus-end-directed kinetochore motor required congression pole-proximal chromosomes plus-ends many astral microtubules spindle point cell cortex remains unknown cenp-e guides pole-proximal chromosomes specifically toward equator found congression pole-proximal chromosomes depended specific posttranslational detyrosination spindle microtubules point equator vitro reconstitution experiments demonstrated cenp-e-dependent transport strongly enhanced detyrosinated microtubules blocking tubulin tyrosination cells caused ubiquitous detyrosination spindle microtubules cenp-e transported chromosomes away spindle poles random directions thus cenp-e-driven chromosome congression guided microtubule detyrosination
