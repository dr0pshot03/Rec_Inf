ephrin signalling controls brain size regulating apoptosis neural progenitors
mechanisms controlling brain size include regulation neural progenitor cell proliferation differentiation survival migration show ephrin-a/epha receptor signalling plays key role controlling size mouse cerebral cortex regulating cortical progenitor cell apoptosis vivo gain epha receptor function achieved ectopic expression ephrin-a5 early cortical progenitors expressing epha7 caused transient wave neural progenitor cell apoptosis resulting premature depletion progenitors subsequent dramatic decrease cortical size vitro treatment soluble ephrin-a ligands similarly induced rapid death cultured dissociated cortical progenitors caspase--dependent manner thereby confirming direct effect ephrin/eph signalling apoptotic cascades conversely vivo loss epha function achieved epha7 gene disruption caused reduction apoptosis occurring normally forebrain neural progenitors resulting increase cortical size extreme cases exencephalic forebrain overgrowth together results identify ephrin/eph signalling physiological trigger apoptosis can alter brain size shape regulating number neural progenitors
