rewiring cellular morphology pathways synthetic guanine nucleotide exchange factors 
eukaryotic cells mobilize actin cytoskeleton generate remarkable diversity morphological behaviours including motility phagocytosis cytokinesis much diversity mediated guanine nucleotide exchange factors gefs activate rho family gtpases master regulators actin cytoskeleton- rho gefs human genome compared genes rho gtpases evolution new diverse gefs thought provide mechanism linking core cytoskeletal machinery wide range new control inputs test hypothesis ask can systematically reprogramme cellular morphology engineering synthetic gef proteins focused dbl family rho gefs highly modular structure common many signalling proteins: contain catalytic dbl homology dh domain linked diverse regulatory domains many autoinhibit gef activity show recombining catalytic gef domains new regulatory modules can generate synthetic gefs activated non-native inputs used synthetic gefs reprogramme cellular behaviour diverse ways gefs can used link specific cytoskeletal responses normally unrelated upstream signalling pathways addition multiple synthetic gefs can linked components series form artificial cascade improved signal processing behaviour results show high degree evolutionary plasticity important family modular signalling proteins indicate may possible use synthetic biology approaches manipulate complex spatio-temporal control cell morphology
