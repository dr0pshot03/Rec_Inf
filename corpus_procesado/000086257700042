soluble air-stable organic semiconductor high electron mobility 
electronic devices based organic semiconductors offer attractive alternative conventional inorganic devices due potentially lower costs simpler packaging compatibility flexible substrates case silicon-based microelectronics use complementary logic elements-requiring n p-type semiconductors whose majority charge carriers electrons holes respectively-is expected crucial achieving low-power high-speed performance similarly electron-segregating domains photovoltaic assemblies require n p-type semiconductors- stable organic p-type semiconductors known practically useful n-type semiconductor materials proved difficult develop reflecting unfavourable electrochemical properties known electron-demanding polymers although high electron mobilities obtained organic materials values usually obtained single crystals low temperatures whereas practically useful field-effect transistors fets will made polycrystalline films remain functional room temperature organic n-type semiconductors can used fets known suffer low electron mobility poor stability air and/or demanding processing conditions- report crystallographically engineered naphthalenetetracarboxylic diimide derivative allows us fabricate solution-cast n-channel fets promising performance ambient conditions integrating n-channel fets solution-deposited p-channel fets able produce complementary inverter circuit whose active layers deposited entirely liquid phase expect complementary circuit designs can realized approach well
