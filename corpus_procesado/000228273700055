assortative mating sympatric host races european corn borer 
although growing body work supports plausibility sympatric speciation animals practical difficulties directly quantifying reproductive isolation diverging taxa remain obstacle analyzing process used combination genetic biogeochemical markers produce direct field estimate assortative mating phytophagous insect populations show individuals insect species european corn borer ostrinia nubilalis develop different host plants can display almost absolute reproductive isolation-the proportion assortative mating >%-even absence temporal spatial isolation
