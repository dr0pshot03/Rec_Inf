three-state mechanism couples ligand temperature sensing riboswitches 
riboswitches cis-acting gene-regulatory rna elements can function level transcription translation rna cleavage- commonly accepted molecular mechanism riboswitch function proposes ligand-dependent conformational switch two mutually exclusive states according mechanism ligand binding aptamer domain induces allosteric conformational switch expression platform leading activation repression ligand-related gene expression however many riboswitch properties explained pure two-state mechanism show regulation mechanism adenine-sensing riboswitch encoded add gene chromosome ii human gram-negative pathogenic bacterium vibrio vulnificus notably different two-state switch mechanism involves three distinct stable conformations characterized temperature mg2+ dependence population ratios three conformations kinetics interconversion nucleotide resolution observed temperature dependence pre-equilibrium involving two structurally distinct ligand-free conformations add riboswitch conferred efficient regulation physiologically relevant temperature range robust switching key requirement gene regulation bacteria adapt environments varying temperatures translational adenine-sensing riboswitch represents first example knowledge temperature-compensated regulatory rna element
