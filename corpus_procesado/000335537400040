restoration large damage volumes polymers 
regenerative power tissues organs biology analog synthetic materials although self-healing microscopic defects demonstrated regrowth material lost catastrophic damage requires regenerative-like approach demonstrate vascular synthetic system restores mechanical performance response large-scale damage gap-filling scaffolds created two-stage polymer chemistry initially forms shape-conforming dynamic gel later polymerizes solid structural polymer robust mechanical properties control reaction kinetics vascular delivery rate filled impacted regions exceed mm diameter within min restored mechanical function within hours restoration impact damage % total absorbed energy recovered comparison initial impact tests
