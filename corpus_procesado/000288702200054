developmental transcriptome drosophila melanogaster 
drosophila melanogaster one well studied genetic model organisms; nonetheless genome still contains unannotated coding non-coding genes transcripts exons rna editing sites full discovery annotation pre-requisites understanding regulation transcription splicing rna editing directs development complex organism used rna-seq tiling microarrays cdna sequencing explore transcriptome distinct developmental stages identified new elements including thousands genes coding non-coding transcripts exons splicing editing events inferred protein isoforms previously eluded discovery using established experimental prediction conservation-based approaches data substantially expand number known transcribed elements drosophila genome provide high-resolution view transcriptome dynamics throughout development
