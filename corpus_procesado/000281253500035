trapping diradical transition state mechanochemical polymer extension
transition state structures central rates outcomes chemical reactions fleeting existence often leaves properties inferred rather observed treating polybutadiene difluorocarbene source embedded gem-difluorocyclopropanes gdfcs along polymer backbone report mechanochemical activation polymer tension opens gdfcs traps -diradical formally transition state stress-free electrocyclic isomerization trapped diradical lives long enough can observe noncanonical participation bimolecular addition reactions furthermore application transient tensile force induces net isomerization trans-gdfc less-stable cis isomer leading counterintuitive result gdfc contracts response transient force extension
