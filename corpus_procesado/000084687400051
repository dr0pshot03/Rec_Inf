caspase mediates endoplasmic-reticulum-specific apoptosis cytotoxicity amyloid-beta 
apoptosis cellular suicide important normal development tissue homeostasis much little apoptosis can also cause disease family cysteine proteases so-called caspases critical mediators programmed cell death thus far family members identified caspase- refs mediate signal transduction downstream death receptors located plasma membrane others caspase ref mediate apoptotic signals mitochondrial damage stress endoplasmic reticulum er can also result apoptosis show caspase localized er activated er stress including disruption er calcium homeostasis accumulation excess proteins er membrane mitochondrial-targeted apoptotic signals mice deficient caspase resistant er stress-induced apoptosis cells undergo apoptosis response death stimuli furthermore show caspase--deficient cortical neurons defective apoptosis induced amyloid-beta protein staurosporine trophic factor deprivation thus caspase mediates er-specific apoptosis pathway may contribute amyloid-beta neurotoxicity
