taste receptor cells discriminate bitter stimuli 
recent studies showing single taste bud cells express multiple bitter taste receptors reignited long-standing controversy whether single gustatory receptor cells respond selectively broadly tastants examined calcium responses rat taste receptor cells situ panel bitter compounds determine whether individual cells distinguish bitter stimuli bitter-responsive taste cells activated one five compounds tested taste cells responded multiple stimuli significant associations two stimuli bitter sensation appear occur activation homogeneous population broadly tuned bitter-sensitive taste cells instead different bitter stimuli may activate different subpopulations bitter-sensitive taste cells
