crystal structure potassium ion transporter trkh
trkh/trkg/ktrb proteins mediate k+ uptake bacteria probably evolved simple k+ channels multiple gene duplications fusions present crystal structure trkh vibrio parahaemolyticus trkh homodimer protomer contains ion permeation pathway selectivity filter similar architecture k+ channels significantly shorter lined backbone side-chain oxygen atoms functional studies showed trkh selective permeation k+ rb+ smaller ions na+ li+ immediately intracellular selectivity filter intramembrane loop arginine residue highly conserved constrict permeation pathway substituting arginine alanine significantly increases rate k+ flux results reveal molecular basis k+ selectivity suggest novel gating mechanism large important family membrane transport proteins
