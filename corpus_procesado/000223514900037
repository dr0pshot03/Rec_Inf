detachment fronts onset dynamic friction
dynamics friction studied hundreds years yet many aspects everyday processes understood one aspect onset frictional motion slip first described years ago transition static dynamic friction onset slip central fields diverse physics- tribology mechanics earthquakes- fracture- show onset frictional slip governed three different types coherent crack-like fronts: observed real-time visualization net contact area forms interface separating two blocks like material two fronts propagate subsonic intersonic velocities subject intensive recent interest- show third type front propagates order magnitude slowly dominant mechanism rupture interface overall motion sliding blocks occurs either slower two fronts traverses entire interface
