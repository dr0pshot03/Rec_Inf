v1 spinal neurons regulate speed vertebrate locomotor outputs 
neuronal networks generate vertebrate movements walking swimming embedded spinal cord- networks referred central pattern generators cpgs ideal systems determining ensembles neurons generate simple behavioural outputs spite efforts address organization locomotor cpg walking animals- little known identity function spinal interneuron cell types contribute locomotor networks use four complementary genetic approaches directly address function mouse v1 neurons class local circuit inhibitory interneurons selectively express transcription factor engrailed1 results show v1 neurons shape motor outputs locomotion required generating fast motor bursting findings outline important role inhibition regulating frequency locomotor cpg rhythm also suggest v1 neurons may evolutionarily conserved role controlling speed vertebrate locomotor movements
