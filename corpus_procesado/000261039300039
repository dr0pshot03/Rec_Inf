interaction predation competition 
competition predation heavily investigated species interactions ecology dominating studies species diversity maintenance however two interactions commonly viewed highly asymmetrically competition resources seen primary interaction limiting diversity predation modifying competition although theoretical models long supported diverse views- show using comprehensive three trophic level model competition predation viewed symmetrically: two interactions equally able either limit promote diversity diversity maintenance requires within species density feedback loops stronger species feedback loops quantify contributions predation competition loops simple interpretable form showing equivalent potential strengthen weaken diversity maintenance moreover show competition predation can undermine tendency stronger interaction promote limit diversity prevailing past failure appreciate symmetrical effects interactions competition predation unduly restricted diversity maintenance studies multitrophic perspective adopted examine greater variety possible effects predation generally considered past conservation management strategies need much concerned implications changes strengths trophic interactions
