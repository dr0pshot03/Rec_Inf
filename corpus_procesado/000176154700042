density-dependent mortality latitudinal gradient species diversity 
ecologists long postulated density-dependent mortality maintains high tree diversity tropics- species experience greater mortality abundant rare species can persist- agents density-dependent mortality host-specific predators pathogens may prevalent stronger effects tropical forests limited climatic factors- decreasing density-dependent mortality increasing latitude partially explain observed latitudinal gradient tree diversity- hypothesis never tested latitudinal data show several temperate tree species experience density-dependent mortality seed dispersal seedling establishment proportion species affected equivalent tropical forests- failing support hypothesis mechanism prevalent tropical latitudes show density-dependent mortality misinterpreted previous studies results evidence studies suggest density-dependent mortality important many forests thus unless strength density-dependent mortality varies latitude mechanism likely explain high diversity tropical forests
