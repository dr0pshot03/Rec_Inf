negligible glacial-interglacial variation continental chemical weathering rates
chemical weathering continents central regulation atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations hence global climate million-year timescales silicate weathering leads draw-down carbon dioxide millennial timescales chemical weathering affects calcium carbonate saturation state oceans hence uptake carbon dioxide however variations chemical weathering rates glacial interglacial cycles remain uncertain glacial periods cold dry conditions reduce rate chemical weathering intense physical weathering exposure carbonates continental shelves due low sea levels may increase rate present high-resolution records lead isotope composition ferromanganese crusts north atlantic ocean cover past years combining records simple quantitative model changes lead isotope composition deep north atlantic ocean response chemical weathering find chemical weathering rates two three times lower glaciated interior north atlantic region glacial periods intervening interglacial periods decrease roughly balances increase chemical weathering caused exposure continental shelves indicating chemical weathering rates remained relatively constant glacial interglacial timescales timescales million years however suggest enhanced weathering silicate glacial sediments interglacial periods results net draw-down atmospheric carbon dioxide creating positive feedback global climate initiated promotes cooling glaciation
