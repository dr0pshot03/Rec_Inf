amino-acid imbalance explains extension lifespan dietary restriction drosophila 
dietary restriction extends healthy lifespan diverse organisms reduces fecundity widely assumed induce adaptive reallocation nutrients reproduction somatic maintenance aiding survival food shortages nature- case long life dietary restriction high fecundity full feeding mutually exclusive competition limiting nutrients report test idea identified nutrients producing responses lifespan fecundity dietary restriction drosophila adding essential amino acids dietary restriction condition increased fecundity decreased lifespan similar effects full feeding nutrients little effect however methionine alone necessary sufficient increase fecundity much full feeding without reducing lifespan reallocation nutrients therefore explain responses dietary restriction lifespan decreased addition amino acids interaction methionine essential amino acids key role hence imbalance dietary amino acids away ratio optimal reproduction shortens lifespan full feeding limits fecundity dietary restriction reduced activity insulin/insulin-like growth factor signalling pathway extends lifespan diverse organisms find also protects shortening lifespan full feeding organisms including mammals may possible obtain benefits lifespan dietary restriction without incurring reduction fecundity suitable balance nutrients diet
