complete quantum control single quantum dot spin using ultrafast optical pulses 
basic requirement quantum information processing systems ability completely control state single qubit1- qubits based electron spin universal single qubit gate realized rotation spin angle arbitrary axis driven coherent rabi oscillations two spin states can used demonstrate control rotation angle ramsey interference produced two coherent spin rotations separated variable time delay demonstrates control axis rotation full quantum control electron spin quantum dot previously demonstrated using resonant radio frequency pulses require many spin precession periods7- however optical manipulation spin allows quantum control picosecond femtosecond timescale11- permitting arbitrary rotation completed within one spin precession period6 recent work optical single-spin control demonstrated initialization spin state quantumdot19- well ultrafast manipulation coherence largely unpolarized single spin state17 demonstrate complete coherent control initialized electron spin state quantum dot using picosecond optical pulses first vary intensity single optical pulse observe six rabi oscillations two spin states; apply two sequential pulses observe high contrast ramsey interference two pulse sequence realizes arbitrary single qubit gate completed picosecond timescale along spin initialization final projective measurement spin state results demonstrate complete set optical single qubit operations
