single-pulse coherently controlled nonlinear raman spectroscopy microscopy 
molecular vibrations oscillation periods reflect molecular structure hence used spectroscopic fingerprint detection identification present nonlinear spectroscopy schemes use two laser beams measure vibrations1 availability ultrashort femtosecond optical pulses durations shorter typical molecular vibration periods enabled coherent excitation molecular vibrations using single pulse2 perform single-pulse vibrational spectroscopy several molecules liquid phase excitation readout processes performed pulse main difficulty single-pulse spectroscopy vibrational levels energies within pulse bandwidth excited achieve high spectral resolution nearly two orders magnitude better pulse bandwidth using quantum coherent control techniques appropriately modulating spectral phase pulse able exploit quantum interference multiple paths selectively populate given vibrational level probe population using pulse scheme using single broadband laser source particularly attractive nonlinear microscopy applications demonstrate constructing coherent anti-stokes raman cars microscope operating single laser beam
