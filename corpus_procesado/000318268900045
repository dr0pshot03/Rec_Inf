amplifying genetic logic gates
organisms must process information encoded via developmental environmental signals survive reproduce researchers also engineered synthetic genetic logic realize simpler independent control biological processes developed three-terminal device architecture termed transcriptor uses bacteriophage serine integrases control flow rna polymerase along dna integrase-mediated inversion deletion dna encoding transcription terminators promoter modulates transcription rates realized permanent amplifying nand xor xnor gates actuated across common control signal ranges sequential logic supporting autonomous cell-cell communication dna encoding distinct logic-gate states single-layer digital logic architecture developed enables engineering amplifying logic gates control transcription rates within across diverse organisms
