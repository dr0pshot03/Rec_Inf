extremely short-lived reaction resonances cl plus hd v1 > dcl plus h due chemical bond softening 
cl + h- reaction important benchmark system study chemical reaction dynamics always appeared proceed via direct abstraction mechanism clear signature reaction resonances report high-resolution crossed-molecular beam study cl + hd v j > dcl + h reaction v vibrational quantum number j rotational quantum number forward scattered products observed however two distinctive peaks collision energies kilocalories per mole dcl v product detected backward scattering direction detailed quantum dynamics calculations highly accurate potential energy surface suggested features originate two short-lived dynamical resonances trapped peculiar h-dcl v vibrational adiabatic potential wells result chemical bond softening anticipate dynamical resonances trapped wells exist many reactions involving vibrationally excited molecules
