reversible microbial colonization germ-free mice reveals dynamics iga immune responses 
lower intestine adult mammals densely colonized nonpathogenic commensal microbes gut bacteria induce protective immune responses ensure host-microbial mutualism continuous presence commensal intestinal bacteria made difficult study mucosal immune dynamics report reversible germ-free colonization system mice independent diet antibiotic manipulation slow days onset long-lived half-life weeks highly specific anticommensal immunoglobulin iga response germ-free mice observed ongoing commensal exposure colonized mice rapidly abrogated response sequential doses lacked classical prime-boost effect seen systemic vaccination specific iga induction occurred stepwise response current bacterial exposure antibody repertoire matched existing commensal content
