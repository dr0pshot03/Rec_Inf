cdc14 inhibits transcription rna polymerase anaphase 
chromosome condensation global repression gene transcription features mitosis inmost eukaryotes logic behind phenomenon chromosome condensation prevents activity rna polymerases budding yeast however transcription proposed continuous mitosis show cdc14 protein phosphatase required nucleolar segregation mitotic exit inhibits transcription yeast ribosomal genes rdna anaphase phosphatase activity cdc14 required rna polymerase pol inhibition vitro vivo moreover cdc14-dependent inhibition involves nucleolar exclusion pol subunits demonstrate transcription inhibition necessary complete chromosome disjunction ribosomal rna rrna transcripts block condensin binding rdna show bypassing role cdc14 nucleolar segregation requires vivo degradation nascent transcripts results show transcription interferes chromosome condensation reverse conclude budding yeast like eukaryotes inhibit pol transcription segregation prerequisite chromosome condensation faithful genome separation
