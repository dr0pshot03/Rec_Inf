yeast prion mod5 promotes acquired drug resistance cell survival environmental stress
prion conversion soluble protein aggregated state may involved cellular adaptation yeast environment however remains unclear whether cells actively use prion conversion acquire fitness advantage response environmental stress identified mod5 yeast transfer rna isopentenyltransferase lacking glutamine/asparagine-rich domains yeast prion protein found prion conversion yeast regulated sterol biosynthetic pathway acquired cellular resistance antifungal agents furthermore selective pressure antifungal drugs yeast facilitated de novo appearance mod5 prion states cell survival thus phenotypic changes caused active prion conversion environmental selection may contribute cellular adaptation living organisms
