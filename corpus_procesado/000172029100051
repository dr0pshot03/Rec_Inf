asynchronous replication allelic exclusion immune system 
development mature b cells involves series molecular decisions culminate expression single light-chain heavy-chain antigen receptor cell surface two alleles receptor locus ultimate choice one receptor type must involve process allelic exclusion one way feedback mechanism downregulates rearrangement generation productive receptor molecule recent work suggests monoallelic epigenetic changes may also take place even rearrangement better understand basis distinguishing alleles analysed dna replication timing show b-cell-receptor loci mu kappa lambda tcr beta locus replicate asynchronously pattern established randomly cell early development maintained cloning represents epigenetic mark allelic exclusion almost always early-replicating allele initially selected undergo rearrangement b cells results indicate allelic exclusion immune system may similar process x chromosome inactivation
