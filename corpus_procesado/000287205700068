hspc117 essential subunit human trna splicing ligase complex
splicing mammalian precursor transfer rna trna molecules involves two enzymatic steps first intron removal trna splicing endonuclease generates separate exons animals second step predominantly entails direct exon ligation elusive rna ligase using activity-guided purification trna ligase hela cell extracts identified hspc117 member upf0027 rtcb family essential subunit trna ligase complex rna interference-mediated depletion hspc117 inhibited maturation intron-containing pre-trna vitro living cells high sequence conservation hspc117/rtcb proteins suggestive rna ligase roles protein family various organisms
