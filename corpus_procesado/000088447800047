low-friction nanoscale linear bearing realized multiwall carbon nanotubes 
demonstrate controlled reversible telescopic extension multiwall carbon nanotubes thus realizing ultralow-friction nanoscale linear bearings constant-force nanosprings measurements performed situ individual custom-engineered nanotubes inside high-resolution transmission electron microscope demonstrated anticipated van der waals energy-based retraction force enabled us place quantitative limits static dynamic interwall frictional forces nested nanotubes repeated extension retraction telescoping nanotube segments revealed wear fatigue atomic scale hence nanotubes may constitute near perfect wear-free surfaces
