broken translational rotational symmetry via charge stripe order underdoped yba2cu3o6+y
discovery stripelike order lanthanum-based copper oxide superconductors charge-ordering instabilities observed cuprate families however proven difficult distinguish unidirectional stripes bidirectional checkerboard charge order yttrium-and bismuth-based materials used resonant x-ray scattering measure two-dimensional structure factor superconductor yba2cu3o6+y reciprocal space data reveal presence charge stripe order ie locally unidirectional density waves may represent true microscopic nature charge modulation cuprates time find well-established competition charge order superconductivity stronger charge correlations across stripes along provides additional evidence intrinsic unidirectional nature charge order
