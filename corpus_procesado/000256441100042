strong dissipation inhibits losses induces correlations cold molecular gases
atomic quantum gases strong correlation regime offer unique possibilities explore variety many body quantum phenomena reaching regime usually required strong elastic weak inelastic interactions latter produce losses show strong inelastic collisions can actually inhibit particle losses drive system strongly correlated regime studying dynamics ultracold molecules optical lattice confined one dimension show particle loss rate reduced factor adding lattice along one dimension increases reduction factor results open possibility observe exotic quantum many body phenomena systems suffer strong inelastic collisions
