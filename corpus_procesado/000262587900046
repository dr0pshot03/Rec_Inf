complexin controls force transfer snare complexes membranes fusion
trans snap receptor snare snap defined soluble nsf attachment protein nsf defined n ethylmaleimide sensitive factor complexes catalyze synaptic vesicle fusion bind complexin function complexin binding snare complexes remains unclear show neuronal synapses complexin simultaneously suppressed spontaneous fusion activated fast calcium ion evoked fusion dual function complexin required snare binding also involved distinct amino terminal sequences complexin localize point trans snare complexes insert fusing membranes suggesting complexin controls force trans snare complexes apply onto fusing membranes consistent hypothesis mutation membrane insertion sequence v snare synaptobrevin/ vesicle associated membrane protein vamp phenocopied complexin loss function state without impairing complexin binding snare complexes thus complexin probably activates clamps force transfer assembled trans snare complexes onto fusing membranes
