baff-r newly identified tnf receptor specifically interacts baff
b cell homeostasis shown critically depend baff b cell activation factor tumor necrosis factor tnf family although baff already known bind two receptors bcma taci identified third receptor baff termed baff-r baff-r binding appears highly specific baff suggesting unique role ligand-receptor interaction consistent baff-r locus disrupted a/wysnj mice display b cell phenotype qualitatively similar baff-deficient mice thus baff-r appears principal receptor baff-mediated mature b cell survival
