topology abstract mathematical constructs often manifests physics pivotal role understanding natural phenomena notably discovery topological phases condensed-matter systems changed modern conception phases matter- global nature topological ordering however makes direct experimental probing outstanding challenge present experimental tools mainly indirect result inadequate studying topology physical systems fundamental level employ exquisite control afforded state-of-the-art superconducting quantum circuits investigate topological properties various quantum systems essence approach infer geometric curvature measuring deflection quantum trajectories curved space hamiltonian topological properties revealed integrating curvature closed surfaces quantum analogue gauss-bonnet theorem benchmark technique investigating basic topological concepts historically important haldane model mapping momentum space condensed-matter model parameter space single-qubit hamiltonian addition constructing topological phase diagram able visualize microscopic spin texture associated states evolution across topological phase transition going beyond non-interacting systems demonstrate power method studying topology interacting quantum system required anew qubit architecture allows simultaneous control every term two-qubit hamiltonian exploring parameter space hamiltonian discover emergence interaction-induced topological phase work establishes powerful generalizable experimental platform study topological phenomena quantum systems
