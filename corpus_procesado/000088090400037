topographic mapping quantum hall liquid using few-electron bubble 
scanning probe technique used obtain high-resolution map random electrostatic potential inside quantum hall liquid sharp metal tip scanned semiconductor surface sensed charges embedded two-dimensional 2d electron gas quantum hall effect conditions applying positive voltage tip locally enhanced 2d electron density created bubble electrons otherwise unoccupied landau level rip scanned along sample surface bubble followed underneath tip sensed motions single electrons entering leaving bubble response changes local 2d electrostatic potential
