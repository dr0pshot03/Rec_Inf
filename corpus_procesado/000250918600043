legionella pneumophila proteins regulate rab1 membrane cycling
rab1 gtpase regulates transport endoplasmic-reticulum-derived vesicles eukaryotic cells intracellular pathogen legionella pneumophila subverts rab1 function create vacuole supports bacterial replication mechanism well understood describe l pneumophila proteins control rab1 activity directly show region drra defect rab1 recruitment protein required recruitment rab1 membranes functions guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor displacement factor second region drra protein stimulated rab1 activation functioning guanine nucleotide exchange factor lepb protein found inactivate rab1 stimulating gtp hydrolysis indicating lepb gtpase-activating protein activity regulates removal rab proteins membranes thus l pneumophila encodes proteins regulate three distinct biochemical reactions critical rab gtpase membrane cycling redirect rab1 pathogen-occupied vacuole control rab1 function
