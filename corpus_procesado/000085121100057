design single-layer beta-sheets without hydrophobic core 
hydrophobic effect main thermodynamic driving force folding water-soluble proteins exclusion nonpolar moieties aqueous solvent results formation hydrophobic core protein generally considered essential specifying stabilizing folded structures proteins- outer surface protein ospa borrelia burgdorferi contains three-stranded beta-sheet segment connects two globular domains although single-layer beta sheet segment exposed solvent faces thus contain hydrophobic core segment high conformational stability report engineering ospa variants contain larger single-layer beta-sheets comprising five seven beta-strands duplicating beta-hairpin unit within beta-sheet nuclear magnetic resonance small-angle x-ray scattering analyses reveal extended single-layer beta-sheets formed designed amide hydrogen-deuterium exchange chemical denaturation show stable thus interactions within beta-hairpin unit adjacent units involve formation hydrophobic core sufficient specify stabilize single-layer beta-sheet structure results provide expanded view protein folding misfolding design
