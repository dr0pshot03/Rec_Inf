dynamics nucleosome remodelling individual acf complexes 
atp-dependent chromatin assembly remodelling factor acf functions generate regularly spaced nucleosomes required heritable gene silencing mechanism acf mobilizes nucleosomes remains poorly understood report single-molecule fret study monitors remodelling individual nucleosomes acf real time revealing previously unknown remodelling intermediates dynamics presence acf atp nucleosomes exhibit gradual translocation along dna interrupted well-defined kinetic pauses occurred approximately seven three four base pairs translocation binding acf translocation dna exiting translocation pauses atp-dependent revealing three distinct functional roles atp remodelling equilibrium continuously bound acf complex can move nucleosome back-and-forth many times dissociation indicating acf highly processive bidirectional nucleosome translocase
