evolution increased complexity molecular machine
many cellular processes carried molecular machines-assemblies multiple differentiated proteins physically interact execute biological functions- despite much speculation strong evidence mechanisms assemblies evolved lacking use ancestral gene resurrection- manipulative genetic experiments determine complexity essential molecular machine-the hexameric transmembrane ring eukaryotic v-atpase proton pump-increased hundreds millions years ago show ring fungi composed three paralogous proteins evolved ancient two-paralogue complex gene duplication followed loss daughter copy specific interfaces interacts ring proteins losses complementary copies became obligate components restricted spatial roles complex reintroducing single historical mutation paralogue lineage resurrected ancestral proteins sufficient recapitulate asymmetric degeneration trigger requirement elaborate three-component ring experiments show increased complexity essential molecular machine evolved simple high-probability evolutionary processes without apparent evolution novel functions point plausible mechanism evolution complexity multi-paralogue protein complexes
