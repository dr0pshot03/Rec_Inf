molecular architecture cadherins native epidermal desmosomes 
desmosomes cadherin based adhesive intercellular junctions present tissues heart skin despite considerable efforts molecular interfaces mediate adhesion remain obscure apply cryo electron tomography vitreous sections human epidermis visualize three dimensional molecular architecture desmosomal cadherins close native conditions three dimensional reconstructions show regular array densities similar angstrom intervals along midline curved shape resembling x ray structure c cadherin representative classical cadherin model independent three dimensional image processing extracted sub tomograms reveals cadherin organization fitting c cadherin atomic structure averaged sub tomograms see periodic arrangement trans w like cis v like interaction corresponding molecules opposing membranes cell membrane respectively resulting model cadherin organization explains existing two dimensional data yields insights possible mechanism cadherin based cell adhesion
