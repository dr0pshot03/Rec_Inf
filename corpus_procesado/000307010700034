increase observed net carbon dioxide uptake land oceans past years 
one greatest sources uncertainty future climate predictions response global carbon cycle climate change although approximately one-half total co2 emissions present taken combined land ocean carbon reservoirs models predict decline future carbon uptake reservoirs resulting positive carbon-climate feedback several recent studies suggest rates carbon uptake land- ocean- remained constant declined recent decades work however called question reported decline- use global-scale atmospheric co2 measurements co2 emission inventories full range uncertainties calculate changes global co2 sources sinks past years mass balance analysis shows net global carbon uptake increased significantly billion tonnes carbon per year global carbon uptake doubled +/ +/ billion tonnes per year therefore unlikely land ocean carbon sinks decreased global scale since approximately billion tonnes carbon emitted humans atmosphere per cent moved land oceans thus identifying mechanisms locations responsible increasing global carbon uptake remains critical challenge constraining modern global carbon budget predicting future carbon-climate interactions
