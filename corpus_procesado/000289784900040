latitudinal gradients greenhouse seawater delta o-: evidence eocene sirenian tooth enamel
eocene greenhouse climate state linked vigorous hydrologic cycle mid-and high latitudes similar information precipitation levels low latitudes however limited oxygen isotopic fluxes track moisture fluxes thus delta o values ocean surface waters can provide insight hydrologic cycle changes offset tropical d18o values sampled eocene sirenian tooth enamel modern surface waters greater expected per mil increase due increased continental ice volume increased offset result suppression surface-water delta o values tropical annual moisture balance substantially wetter today results atmospheric general circulation model support interpretation suggest eocene low latitudes extremely wet
