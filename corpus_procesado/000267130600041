atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration across mid-pleistocene transition
dominant period pleistocene glacial cycles changed mid-pleistocene years years yet unknown reasons present -million-year record sea surface partial pressure co2 pco based boron isotopes planktic foraminifer shells suggests atmospheric partial pressure co2 pco relatively stable mid-pleistocene climate transition glacial pco similar microatmospheres higher transition million years ago interglacial pco similar late pleistocene interglacial cycles < years ago estimates consistent close linkage atmospheric co2 concentration global climate lack gradual decrease interglacial pco support suggestion long-term drawdown atmospheric co2 main cause climate transition
