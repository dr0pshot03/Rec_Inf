cdk1 sufficient drive mammalian cell cycle 
unicellular organisms yeasts require single cyclin-dependent kinase cdk1 drive cell division1 contrast mammalian cells thought require sequential activation least four different cyclin dependent kinases cdk2 cdk3 cdk4 cdk6 drive cells interphase well cdk1 proceed mitosis2 model challenged recent genetic evidence mice survive absence individual interphase cdks3- moreover mouse cell types proliferate absence two even three interphase cdks8- similar results obtained ablation activating subunits cdks d type e type cyclins11- show mouse embryos lacking interphase cdks cdk2 cdk3 cdk4 cdk6 undergo organogenesis develop midgestation embryos cdk1 binds cyclins resulting phosphorylation retinoblastoma protein prb expression genes regulated e2f transcription factors mouse embryonic fibroblasts derived embryos proliferate vitro albeit extended cell cycle due inefficient inactivation rb proteins however become immortal continuous passage also report embryos fail develop morula blastocyst stages absence cdk1 results indicate cdk1 essential cell cycle cdk moreover show absence interphase cdks cdk1 can execute events required drive cell division
