tremor-tide correlations near-lithostatic pore pressure deep san andreas fault 
since initial discovery nearly decade ago non-volcanic tremor provided information region earth previously thought incapable generating seismic radiation thorough explanation geologic process responsible tremor generation however yet determined owing location plate interface temporal correlation geodetically measured slow-slip events dominant shear wave energy tremor observations southwest japan interpreted superposition many low-frequency earthquakes represent slip fault surface fluids may also fundamental failure process subduction zone environments teleseismic tidal modulation tremor cascadia japan high poisson ratios source regions indicative pressurized pore fluids- identify robust correlation extremely small tidally induced shear stress parallel san andreas fault non-volcanic tremor activity near parkfield california suggest tremor represents shear failure critically stressed fault presence near-lithostatic pore pressure number similarities tremor subduction zone environments cascadia japan tremor deep san andreas transform- suggesting results presented may also applicable tectonic settings
