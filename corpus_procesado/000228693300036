giant gamma-ray flare magnetar sgr - 
two classes rotating neutron stars-soft gamma-ray repeaters sgrs anomalous x-ray pulsars-are magnetars1 whose x-ray emission powered strong magnetic field b approximate g sgrs occasionally become active producing many short x-ray bursts extremely rarely sgr emits giant flare total energy thousand times higher typical burst2- report sgr - emitted giant flare december total isotropic flare energy x erg hundred times higher two previously observed giant flares energy release probably occurred catastrophic reconfiguration neutron stars magnetic field event occurred larger distance within megaparsecs resembled short hard gamma-ray burst suggesting flares extragalactic sgrs may form subclass bursts
