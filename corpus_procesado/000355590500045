rapid nitrous oxide cycling suboxic ocean 
nitrous oxide n2o powerful greenhouse gas major cause stratospheric ozone depletion yet sources sinks remain poorly quantified oceans used isotope tracers directly measure n2o reduction rates eastern tropical north pacific incomplete denitrification n2o cycling rates order magnitude higher predicted current models suboxic regions spatial distribution suggests strong dependence organic carbon dissolved oxygen concentrations furthermore n2o turnover times higher net atmospheric efflux rapid rate cycling coupled expected expansion suboxic ocean waters implies future increases n2o emissions
