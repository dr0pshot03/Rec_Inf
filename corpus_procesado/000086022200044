seismic hazard marmara sea region following august izmit earthquake 
august destructive magnitude earthquake occurred km east istanbul near city izmit north anatolian fault -km-long plate boundary slips average rate cm yr- refs historically site many devastating earthquakes century alone ruptured km length models earthquake-induced stress change combined active fault maps used forecast epicentral area izmit event indeed likely location occurrence large earthquake show event significantly modifies stress distribution resulting previous fault interactions new stress models take account events region magnitudes greater occurred since ref well secular interseismic stress change constrained gps data models provide consistent picture long term spatio-temporal behaviour north anatolian fault indicate two events magnitude equal greater izmit earthquake likely occur within next decades beneath marmara sea south istanbul
