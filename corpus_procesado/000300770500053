deleted colorectal carcinoma suppresses metastasis p53-deficient mammary tumours 
since discovery early 1990s deleted colorectal cancer dcc gene located chromosome 18q21 proposed tumour suppressor gene loss implicated majority advanced colorectal many cancers dcc belongs family netrin receptors function dependence receptors control survival apoptosis depending ligand binding however role dcc tumour suppressor remains controversial rarity dcc-specific mutations presence tumour suppressor genes chromosomal region show mouse model mammary carcinoma based somatic inactivation p53 additional loss dcc promotes metastasis formation without affecting primary tumour phenotype furthermore demonstrate cell cultures derived p53-deficient mouse mammary tumours dcc expression controls netrin--dependent cell survival providing mechanistic basis enhanced metastatic capacity tumour cells lacking dcc consistent idea vivo tumour-cell survival enhanced dcc loss together data support function dcc context-dependent tumour suppressor limits survival disseminated tumour cells
