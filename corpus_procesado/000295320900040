innate immune recognition bacterial ligands naips determines inflammasome specificity 
inflammasomes family cytosolic multiprotein complexes initiate innate immune responses pathogenic microbes activating caspase protease although genetic data support critical role inflammasomes immune defence inflammatory diseases molecular basis individual inflammasomes respond specific stimuli remains poorly understood inflammasome contains nlrc4 nlr family card domain containing protein previously shown activated response two distinct bacterial proteins flagellin prgj conserved component pathogen-associated type iii secretion systems however direct binding nlrc4 flagellin prgj never demonstrated homologue nlrc4 naip5 nlr family apoptosis inhibitory protein implicated activation nlrc4 refs widely assumed auxiliary role naip5 often dispensable nlrc4 activation however naip5 member small multigene family raising possibility redundancy functional specialization among naip genes show mice different naip paralogues determine specificity nlrc4 inflammasome distinct bacterial ligands particular found activation endogenous nlrc4 bacterial prgj requires naip2 previously uncharacterized member naip gene family whereas naip5 naip6 activate nlrc4 specifically response bacterial flagellin dissected biochemical mechanism underlying requirement naip proteins use reconstituted nlrc4 inflammasome system found naip proteins control ligand-dependent oligomerization nlrc4 naip2-nlrc4 complex physically associates prgj flagellin whereas naip5-nlrc4 associates flagellin prgj results identify naips immune sensor proteins provide biochemical evidence simple receptor-ligand model activation naip-nlrc4 inflammasomes
