frequency dependence osmo-adaptation saccharomyces cerevisiae 
propagation information signaling cascades spans wide range time scales including rapid ligand receptor interaction much slower response downstream gene expression determine dynamic range dominates response used periodic stimuli measure frequency dependence signal transduction osmo adaptation pathway saccharomyces cerevisiae applied system identification methods infer concise predictive model found dynamics osmo adaptation response dominated fast-acting negative feedback kinase hog1 require protein synthesis large osmotic shocks additional much slower negative feedback gene expression allows cells respond faster future stimuli
