observation brownian motion liquids short times: instantaneous velocity memory loss
measurement instantaneous velocity brownian motion suspended particles liquid probes microscopic foundations statistical mechanics soft condensed matter however instantaneous velocity eluded experimental observation century since einsteins prediction small length time scales involved report shot-noise-limited high-bandwidth measurements brownian motion micrometer-sized beads suspended water acetone optical tweezer observe hydrodynamic instantaneous velocity brownian motion liquid follows modified energy equipartition theorem accounts kinetic energy fluid displaced moving bead also observe anticorrelated thermal force conventionally assumed uncorrelated
