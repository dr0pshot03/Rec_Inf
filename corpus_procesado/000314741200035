reconstructing state mixtures diffraction measurements 
progress imaging metrology depends exquisite control comprehensive characterization wave fields reflected name coherent diffractive imaging relies high coherence reconstructing highly resolved images diffraction intensities alone without need image-forming lenses- fully coherent light can described adequately single pure state yet partial coherence imperfect detection often need accounted requiring statistical optics superposition states furthermore dynamics samples increasingly objectives experiments provide general analytic approach characterization diffractive imaging systems can described low-rank mixed states use experimental data simulations show reconstruction technique compensates characterizes various sources decoherence quantitatively based ptychography procedure closely related quantum state tomography equally applicable high-resolution microscopy wave sensing fluctuation measurements result stringent experimental conditions ptychography can relaxed susceptibility imaging artefacts reduced furthermore method yields high-resolution images mixed states within sample may include quantum mixtures fast stationary stochastic processes vibrations switching steady flows
