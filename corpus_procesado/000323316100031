onset deglacial warming west antarctica driven local orbital forcing 
cause warming southern hemisphere recent deglaciation remains matter debate hypotheses northern hemisphere trigger oceanic redistributions heat based part abrupt onset warming seen east antarctic ice cores dated years ago several thousand years high-latitude northern hemisphere summer insolation intensity began increasing minimum approximately years ago alternative explanation local solar insolation changes cause southern hemisphere warm independently present results new annually resolved ice-core record west antarctica reconciles two views records show years ago snow accumulation west antarctica began increasing coincident increasing carbon dioxide concentrations warming east antarctica cooling northern hemisphere associated abrupt decrease atlantic meridional overturning circulation however significant warming west antarctica began least years earlier circum-antarctic sea-ice decline driven increasing local insolation likely cause warming marine-influenced west antarctic records suggest active role southern ocean onset deglaciation inferred ice cores east antarctic interior largely isolated sea-ice changes
