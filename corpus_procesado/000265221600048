dna binding site sequence directs glucocorticoid receptor structure activity
genes simply turned instead expression fine-tuned meet needs cell genes modulated precisely well understood glucocorticoid receptor gr regulates target genes associating specific dna binding sites sequences differ genes traditionally binding sites viewed docking sites using structural biochemical cell-based assays show gr binding sequences differing little single base pair differentially affect gr conformation regulatory activity therefore propose dna sequence-specific allosteric ligand gr tailors activity receptor toward specific target genes
