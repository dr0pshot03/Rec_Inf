kcnq1 gain-of-function mutation familial atrial fibrillation
atrial fibrillation af common cardiac arrhythmia whose molecular etiology poorly understood studied family hereditary persistent af identified causative mutation s140g kcnq1 kvlqt1 gene chromosome 11p15 kcnq1 gene encodes pore-forming alpha subunit cardiac i-ks channel kcnq1/kcne1 kcnq1/kcne2 kcnq1/kcne3 potassium channels functional analysis s140g mutant revealed gain-of-function effect kcnq1/kcne1 kcnq1/kcne2 currents contrasts dominant negative loss-of-function effects kcnq1 mutations previously identified patients long qt syndrome thus s140g mutation likely initiate maintain af reducing action potential duration effective refractory period atrial myocytes
