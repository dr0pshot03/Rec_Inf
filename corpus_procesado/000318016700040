pink1-phosphorylated mitofusin parkin receptor culling damaged mitochondria 
senescent damaged mitochondria undergo selective mitophagic elimination mechanisms requiring two parkinsons disease factors mitochondrial kinase pink1 pten-induced putative kinase protein pten phosphatase tensin homolog cytosolic ubiquitin ligase parkin nature pink-parkin interaction identity key factors directing parkin damaged mitochondria unknown show mitochondrial outer membrane guanosine triphosphatase mitofusin mfn mediates parkin recruitment damaged mitochondria parkin bound mfn2 pink1-dependent manner pink1 phosphorylated mfn2 promoted parkin-mediated ubiqitination ablation mfn2 mouse cardiac myocytes prevented depolarization-induced translocation parkin mitochondria suppressed mitophagy accumulation morphologically functionally abnormal mitochondria induced respiratory dysfunction mfn2-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts cardiomyocytes parkin-deficient drosophila heart tubes causing dilated cardiomyopathy thus mfn2 functions mitochondrial receptor parkin required quality control cardiac mitochondria
