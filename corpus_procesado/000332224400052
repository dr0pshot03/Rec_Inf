ultraviolet-radiation-induced inflammation promotes angiotropism metastasis melanoma 
intermittent intense ultraviolet uv exposure represents important aetiological factor development malignant melanoma ability uv radiation cause tumour-initiating dna mutations melanocytes now firmly established microenvironmental effects uv radiation influence melanoma pathogenesis fully understood report repetitive uv exposure primary cutaneous melanomas genetically engineered mouse model promotes metastatic progression independent tumour-initiating effects uv irradiation enhanced expansion tumour cells along abluminal blood vessel surfaces increased number lung metastases effect depended recruitment activation neutrophils initiated release high mobility group box hmgb1 uv-damaged epidermal keratinocytes driven toll-like receptor tlr4 uv-induced neutrophilic inflammatory response stimulated angiogenesis promoted ability melanoma cells migrate towards endothelial cells use selective motility cues surfaces results reveal uv irradiation epidermal keratinocytes sensed innate immune system also show resulting inflammatory response catalyses reciprocal melanoma-endothelial cell interactions leading perivascular invasion phenomenon originally described angiotropism human melanomas histopathologists angiotropism represents hitherto underappreciated mechanism metastasis also increases likelihood intravasation haematogenous dissemination consistent findings ulcerated primary human melanomas abundant neutrophils reactive angiogenesis frequently show angiotropism high risk metastases work indicates targeting inflammation-induced phenotypic plasticity melanoma cells association endothelial cells represent rational strategies specifically interfere metastatic progression
