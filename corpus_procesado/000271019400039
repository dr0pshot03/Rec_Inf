temporal spatial variability lunar hydration observed deep impact spacecraft
moon generally anhydrous yet deep impact spacecraft found entire surface hydrated portions day hydroxyl oh water ho absorptions near infrared strongest near north pole consistent < weight percent ho hydration varied temperature rather cumulative solar radiation inherent absorptivity differences composition observed however comparisons data collected week quarter lunar day apart show dynamic process diurnal changes hydration greater mare basalts similar % highlands similar % hydration loss return steady state occurred entirely local morning evening requiring ready daytime source water-group ions consistent solar wind origin
