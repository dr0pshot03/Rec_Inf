positive-feedback-based bistable memory module governs cell fate decision 
maturation xenopus oocytes can thought process cell fate induction immature oocyte representing default fate mature oocyte representing induced fate12 crucial mediators xenopus oocyte maturation including p42 mitogen-activated protein kinase mapk cell-division cycle protein kinase cdc2 known organized positive feedback loops3 principle positive feedback loops produce actively maintained memory transient inductive stimulus explain irreversibility maturation3- show p42 mapk cdc2 system normally generates irreversible biochemical response transient stimulus response becomes transient positive feedback blocked results explain group intrinsically reversible signal transducers can generate irreversible response systems level show cell fate can maintained self-sustaining pattern protein kinase activation
