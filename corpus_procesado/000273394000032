iron partitioning density changes pyrolite earths lower mantle 
phase transitions chemical composition minerals earths interior influence geophysical interpretations deep structure dynamics pressure-induced spin transition olivine suggested influence iron partitioning depletion resulting distinct layered structure earths lower mantle realistic mantle composition pyrolite observed considerable change iron-magnesium partition coefficient gigapascals explained spin transition much lower pressures however small depletion iron observed major high-pressure phase magnesium silicate perovskite may explained preferential retention iron ion fe3+ changes mineral proportions density associated change partition coefficient observed density profile agrees well seismological models suggests pyrolite good model composition upper middle parts lower mantle
