dynamically controlled protein tunneling paths photosynthetic reaction centers 
marcus theory explained thermal nuclear motions modulate energy gap donor acceptor sites protein electron transfer reactions thermal motions however may also modulate electron tunneling reactions identify new mechanism nuclear dynamics amplification plays central role interference among dominant tunneling pathway tubes destructive cases tunneling takes place protein conformations far equilibrium minimize destructive interference example demonstrate dynamical amplification mechanism affects certain reaction rates photosynthetic reaction center therefore may critical biological function
