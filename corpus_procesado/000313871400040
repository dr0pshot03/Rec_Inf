serine starvation induces stress p53-dependent metabolic remodelling cancer cells
cancer cells acquire distinct metabolic adaptations survive stress associated tumour growth satisfy anabolic demands proliferation tumour suppressor protein p53 also known tp53 influences range cellular metabolic processes including glycolysis oxidative phosphorylation glutaminolysis anti-oxidant response contrast role promoting apoptosis dna-damaging stress p53 can promote cell survival metabolic stress function may contribute tumour suppression also non-cancer-associated functions p53 show human cancer cells rapidly use exogenous serine serine deprivation triggered activation serine synthesis pathway rapidly suppressed aerobic glycolysis resulting increased flux tricarboxylic acid cycle transient p53-p21 also known cdkn1a activation cell-cycle arrest promoted cell survival efficiently channelling depleted serine stores glutathione synthesis thus preserving cellular anti-oxidant capacity cells lacking p53 failed complete response serine depletion resulting oxidative stress reduced viability severely impaired proliferation role p53 supporting cancer cell proliferation serine starvation translated vivo model indicating serine depletion potential role treatment p53-deficient tumours
