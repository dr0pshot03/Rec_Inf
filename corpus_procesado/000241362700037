roles intracellular protein-degradation pathways neurodegeneration
many late-onset neurodegenerative diseases including parkinsons disease huntingtons disease associated formation intracellular aggregates toxic proteins therefore crucial understand factors regulate steady-state levels toxins synthetic degradation stages degradation pathways acting aggregate-prone cytosolic proteins include ubiquitin proteasome system macroautophagy dysfunction ubiquitin proteasome macroautophagy pathways might contribute pathology various neurodegenerative conditions however enhancing macroautophagy drugs rapamycin offer tractable therapeutic strategy number diseases
