single gene affects ecological divergence mate choice drosophila
evolutionary changes traits involved ecological divergence mate choice may produce reproductive isolation speciation however examples dual traits genetic molecular bases evolution identified show methyl-branched cuticular hydrocarbons mbchcs dual trait affects desiccation resistance mate choice drosophila serrata identify fatty acid synthase mfas cg3524 responsible mbchc production drosophila find expression mfas undetectable oenocytes cells produce chcs closely related desiccation-sensitive species d birchii due part multiple changes cis-regulatory sequences mfas suggest ecologically influenced changes production mbchcs contributed reproductive isolation two species
