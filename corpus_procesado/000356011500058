sex determination mosquito aedes aegypti governed dominant male-determining factor m factor located within y chromosome-like region called m locus show m-locus gene nix functions m factor aegypti nix exhibits persistent m linkage early embryonic expression two characteristics required m factor nix knockout clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats crispr-cas9 resulted largely feminized genetic males production female isoforms two key regulators sexual differentiation: doublesex fruitless ectopic expression nix resulted genetic females nearly complete male genitalia thus nix required sufficient initiate male development study provides foundation mosquito control strategies convert female mosquitoes harmless males
