food thought: lower-than-expected crop yield stimulation rising co2 concentrations 
model projections suggest although increased temperature decreased soil moisture will act reduce global crop yields direct fertilization effect rising carbon dioxide concentration [co2] will offset tosses co2 fertilization factors used models project future yields derived enclosure studies conducted approximately years ago free-air concentration enrichment face technology now facilitated large-scale trials major grain crops elevated [co2] fully open-air field conditions trials elevated [co2] enhanced yield similar % less enclosure studies casts serious doubt projections rising [co2] will fully offset losses due climate change
