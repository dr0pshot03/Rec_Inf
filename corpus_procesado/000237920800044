thermodynamic control asymmetric amplification amino acid catalysis
ever since pasteur noticed tartrate crystals exist two non-superimposable forms mirror images one another left right hands phenomenon chirality intrigued scientists molecular level chirality often profound impact recognition interaction events thus important biochemistry pharmacology chemical synthesis much effort directed towards developing asymmetric synthesis strategies yield product molecules significant excess either left-handed right-handed enantiomer usually achieved making use chiral auxiliaries catalysts influence course reaction enantiomeric excess ee product linearly related ee auxiliary catalyst used recent years however increasing number asymmetric reactions documented relationship nonlinear effect can lead asymmetric amplification theoretical models long suggested autocatalytic processes can result kinetically controlled asymmetric amplification prediction now verified experimentally- rationalized mechanistically- autocatalytic alkylation reaction show alternative mechanism gives rise asymmetric amplification based equilibrium solid-liquid phase behaviour amino acids solution amplification mechanismis robust can operate aqueous systems making appealing proposition explaining one tantalizing examples asymmetric amplification development high enantiomeric excess biomolecules presumably racemic prebiotic world
