quantum spin hall effect two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides
quantum spin hall qsh effect materials feature edge states topologically protected backscattering however small band gap materials identified qsh insulators limits applications use first-principles calculations predict class large-gap qsh insulators two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides 1t structure namely 1t-mx2 m tungsten molybdenum x tellurium selenium sulfur structural distortion causes intrinsic band inversion chalcogenide-p metal-d bands additionally spin-orbit coupling opens gap tunable vertical electric field strain propose topological field effect transistor made van der waals heterostructures 1t-mx2 two-dimensional dielectric layers can rapidly switched electric field topological phase transition instead carrier depletion
