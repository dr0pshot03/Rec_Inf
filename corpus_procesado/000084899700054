glutamate release severe brain ischaemia mainly reversed uptake
release glutamate brain anoxia ischaemia triggers death neurons causing mental physical handicap mechanism glutamate release controversial however four release mechanisms postulated: vesicular release dependent external calcium ca+ released intracellular stores release swelling-activated onion channels indomethacin-sensitive process astrocytes- reversed operation glutamate transporters mimicked severe ischaemia hippocampal slices monitored glutamate release receptor-gated current ca1 pyramidal cells killed preferentially ischaemic hippocampus using blockers different release mechanisms demonstrate glutamate release largely reversed operation neuronal glutamate transporters plays key role generating anoxic depolarization abolishes information processing central nervous system minutes start ischaemia mathematical model incorporating k+ channels reversible uptake carriers nmda n-methyl-d-aspartate receptor channels reproduces main features response ischaemia thus transporter-mediated glutamate homeostasis fails dramatically ischaemia: instead removing extracellular glutamate protect neurons transporters release glutamate triggering neuronal death
