memory metamaterials 
resonant elements grant metamaterials distinct properties fundamental limitation restricting useable frequency bandwidth development frequency-agile metamaterials helped alleviate bandwidth restrictions allowing real-time tuning metamaterial frequency response demonstrate electrically controlled persistent frequency tuning metamaterial allows lasting modification response using transient stimulus work demonstrates form memory capacitance interfaces metamaterials class devices known collectively memory devices
