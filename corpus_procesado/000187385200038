observation two distinct superconducting phases cecu2si2
report presence two disconnected superconducting domes pressure-temperature phase diagram partially germanium substituted cecu2si2 lower density superconducting dome lies threshold antiferromagnetic order indicating magnetically mediated pairing whereas higher density superconducting regime straddles weakly first-order volume collapse suggesting pairing interaction based spatially extended density fluctuations two distinct pairing mechanisms thus appear operate single wide superconducting range stoichiometric cecu2si2 might apply generally classes correlated electron systems
