surface mobility postsynaptic ampars tunes synaptic transmission 
ampa glutamate receptors ampars mediate fast excitatory synaptic transmission upon fast consecutive synaptic stimulation transmission can depressed recuperation fast synaptic depression attributed solely recovery transmitter release and/or ampar desensitization show ampar lateral diffusion observed intact hippocampi cultured neurons allows fast exchange desensitized receptors naive functional ones within near postsynaptic density recovery depression tens millisecond time range can explained part fast receptor exchange preventing ampar surface movements cross-linking endogenous clustering calcium rise slow recovery depression physiological regulation postsynaptic receptor mobility affects fidelity synaptic transmission shaping frequency dependence synaptic responses
