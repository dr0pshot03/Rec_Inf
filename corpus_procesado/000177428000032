long-range transport excitonic dark states coupled quantum wells 
past ten years coupled quantum wells emerged promising system experiments bose condensation excitons numerous theoretical- experimental- studies aimed demonstration effect one issues driving studies possibility long-range coherent transport excitons excitons quantum wells typically diffuse micrometres spot generated laser pulse diffusion limited lifetime typically nanoseconds scattering due disorder well structure report photoluminescence measurements ingaas quantum wells observation effect luminescence excitons appears hundreds micrometres away laser excitation spot luminescence appears ring around laser spot almost none appears region laser spot ring implies excitons must travel dark state reach critical distance collectively revert luminescing states unclear whether effect related macroscopic coherence caused bose condensation excitons
