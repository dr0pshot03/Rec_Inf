rotationally resolved infrared spectrum charge transfer complex [ar-n-]+ 
difficulties preparing cluster ions spectroscopic studies limited understanding intermolecular forces charged complexes typical many reactive intermediates infrared spectrum charge transfer complex [ar-n-]+ recorded supersonic planar plasma tunable diode laser spectrometer presented adjacent rovibrational transitions measured near wave numbers assigned molecular nitrogen stretching fundamental sigma+ ground state [ar-n-]+ accurate structural parameters determined confirm linear structure show major part charge located argon atom latter result surprising implies charge switch cationic center upon complexation
