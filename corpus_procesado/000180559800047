tracheal respiration insects visualized synchrotron x-ray imaging 
insects known exchange respiratory gases system tracheal tubes using either diffusion changes internal pressure produced body motion hemolymph circulation however inability see inside living insects limited understanding respiration mechanisms used synchrotron beam obtain x-ray videos living breathing insects beetles crickets ants exhibited rapid cycles tracheal compression expansion head thorax body movements hemolymph circulation account cycles; therefore observations demonstrate previously unknown mechanism respiration insects analogous inflation deflation vertebrate lungs
