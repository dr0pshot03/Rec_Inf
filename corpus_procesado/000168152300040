solid acids fuel cell electrolytes
fuel cells attractive alternatives combustion engines electrical power generation high efficiencies low pollution levels polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells generally considered viable approach mobile applications however membranes require humid operating conditions limit temperature operation less degreesc also permeable methanol hydrogen lowers fuel efficiency solid inorganic acid compounds simply solid acids cshso4 rb3hseo4 widely studied high proton conductivities phase-transition behaviour fuel-cell applications offer advantages anhydrous proton transport high-temperature stability degreesc now however solid acids considered viable fuel-cell electrolyte alternatives owing solubility water extreme ductility raised temperatures approximately degreesc show cell made cshso4 electrolyte membrane mm thick operating degreesc h-/o configuration exhibits promising electrochemical performances: open circuit voltages v current densities ma cm- short circuit moreover solid-acid properties affected exposure humid atmospheres although initial results show promise applications use solid acids fuel cells will require development fabrication techniques reduce electrolyte thickness assessment possible sulphur reduction following prolonged exposure hydrogen
