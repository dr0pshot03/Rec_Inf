splay fault branching along nankai subduction zone 
seismic reflection profiles reveal steeply landward dipping splay faults rupture area magnitude m tonankai earthquake nankai subduction zone splay faults branch upward plate-boundary interface subduction zone depth similar to10 kilometers similar to50 kilometers landward trough axis breaking upper crustal plate slip active splay fault may important mechanism accommodates elastic strain caused relative plate motion
