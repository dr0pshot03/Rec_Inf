evolutionary radiations convergences structural organization mammalian brains 
sizes mammalian brain components seem mostly related sizes whole brain body suggesting one-dimensional scale encephalization- previous multivariate study data concludes evolutionary selection enlargement one brain part constrained selection concerted enlargement whole brain however interactions structurally related pairs brain parts confirm reports differential change brain nuclei imply mosaic rather concerted evolution analyse large number variables simultaneously using multi-dimensional methods show relative proportions different systems functionally integrated brain structures vary independently different mammalian orders demonstrating separate evolutionary radiations mammalian brain organization within major order identify clusters unrelated species occupy similar behavioural niches convergently evolved similar brain proportions conclude within orders mosaic brain organization caused selective adaptation whereas orders suggests interplay selection constraints
