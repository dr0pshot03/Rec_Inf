mars: new core-crystallization regime
evolution martian core widely assumed mirror characteristics observed earths core data experiments performed iron-sulfur iron-nickel-sulfur systems pressures corresponding center mars indicate core presently completely liquid will form outwardly crystallizing iron-rich inner core earth instead planetary cooling will lead core crystallization following either snowing-core model whereby iron-rich solids nucleate outer portions core sink toward center sulfide inner-core model iron-sulfide phase crystallizes form solid inner core
