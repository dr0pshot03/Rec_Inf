tail reconnection triggering substorm onset 
magnetospheric substorms explosively release solar wind energy previously stored earths magnetotail encompassing entire magnetosphere producing spectacular auroral displays unclear whether substorm triggered disruption electrical current flowing across near earth magnetotail similar re re: earth radius kilometers process magnetic reconnection typically seen farther magnetotail similar re report simultaneous measurements magnetotail multiple distances time substorm onset reconnection observed re least minutes auroral intensification least minutes substorm expansion minutes near earth current disruption results demonstrate substorms likely initiated tail reconnection
