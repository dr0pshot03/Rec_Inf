coadministration tumor-penetrating peptide enhances efficacy cancer drugs
poor penetration anticancer drugs tumors can important factor limiting efficacy studied mouse tumor models show previously characterized tumor-penetrating peptide irgd increased vascular tissue permeability tumor-specific neuropilin--dependent manner allowing coadministered drugs penetrate extravascular tumor tissue importantly effect require drugs chemically conjugated peptide systemic injection irgd improved therapeutic index drugs various compositions including small molecule doxorubicin nanoparticles nab-paclitaxel doxorubicin liposomes monoclonal antibody trastuzumab thus coadministration irgd may valuable way enhance efficacy anticancer drugs reducing side effects primary goal cancer therapy research
