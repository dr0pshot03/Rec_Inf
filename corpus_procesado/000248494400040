cylindrical block copolymer micelles co-micelles controlled length architecture
block copolymers consist two chemically different polymers connected covalent linkages solution repulsion blocks leads variety morphologies thermodynamically driven polyferrocenyldimethylsilane block copolymers show unusual propensity forming cylindrical micelles solution found micelle structure grows epitaxially addition polymer producing micelles narrow size dispersity process analogous growth living polymer adding different block copolymer form co-micelles also able selectively functionalize different parts micelle potential applications materials include use lithographic etch resists redox-active templates catalytically active metal nanoparticle precursors
