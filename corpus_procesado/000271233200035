control iron homeostasis iron-regulated ubiquitin ligase 
eukaryotic cells require iron survival developed regulatory mechanisms maintaining appropriate intracellular iron concentrations degradation iron regulatory protein irp2 iron-replete cells key event pathway e3 ubiquitin ligase responsible proteolysis remained elusive found skp1-cul1-fbxl5 ubiquitin ligase protein complex associates promotes iron-dependent ubiquitination degradation irp2 f-box substrate adaptor protein fbxl5 degraded upon iron oxygen depletion process required iron-binding hemerythrin-like domain n terminus thus iron homeostasis regulated proteolytic pathway couples irp2 degradation intracellular iron levels stability activity fbxl5
