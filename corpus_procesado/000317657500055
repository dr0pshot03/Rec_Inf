krab/kap1-mirna cascade regulates erythropoiesis stage-specific control mitophagy 
hematopoiesis lineage stage-specific transcription factors work concert chromatin modifiers direct differentiation blood cells explored role krab-containing zinc finger proteins krab-zfps cofactor kap1 process mice hematopoietic-restricted deletion kap1 resulted severe hypoproliferative anemia kap1-deleted erythroblasts failed induce mitophagy-associated genes retained mitochondria due persistent expression micrornas mirnas targeting mitophagy transcripts secondary lack repression stage-specific krab-zfps krab/kap1-mirna regulatory cascade evolutionarily conserved also controls mitophagy human erythropoiesis thus multilayered transcription regulatory system present protein rna-based repressors superimposed combinatorial fashion govern timely triggering important differentiation event
