absence neutrinos associated cosmic-ray acceleration gamma-ray bursts 
energetic astrophysical events required accelerate cosmic rays electronvolts grbs c-ray bursts proposed possible candidate sources- grb fireball model cosmic-ray acceleration accompanied neutrinos produced decay charged pions created interactions high-energy cosmic-ray protons gamma-rays previous searches neutrinos found none constraints weak sensitivity best approximately equal predicted flux- report upper limit flux energetic neutrinos associated grbs least factor predictions- implies either grbs sources cosmic rays energies exceeding electronvolts efficiency neutrino production much lower predicted
