modulation a-type potassium channels family calcium sensors 
brain heart rapidly inactivating a-type voltage-gated potassium kv currents operate subthreshold membrane potentials control excitability neurons cardiac myocytes12 although pore-forming alpha-subunits kv4 shal-related channel family form a-type currents heterologous cells3 differ significantly native a-type currents describe three kv channel-interacting proteins kchips bind cytoplasmic amino termini kv4 alpha-subunits find expression kchip kv4 together reconstitutes several features native a-type currents modulating density inactivation kinetics rate recovery inactivation kv4 channels heterologous cells three kchips co-localize co-immunoprecipitate brain kv4 alpha-subunits thus integral components native kv4 channel complexes kchips four ef-hand-like domains bind calcium ions activity density neuronal a-type currents tightly control responses excitatory synaptic inputs kchips may regulate a-type currents hence neuronal excitability response changes intracellular calcium
