optogenetic stimulation hippocampal engram activates fear memory recall 
specific memory thought encoded sparse population neurons neurons can tagged learning subsequent identification manipulation- moreover ablation inactivation results reduced memory expression suggesting necessity mnemonic processes however question sufficiency remains: unclear whether possible elicit behavioural output specific memory directly activating population neurons active learning show mice optogenetic reactivation hippocampal neurons activated fear conditioning sufficient induce freezing behaviour labelled population hippocampal dentate gyrus neurons activated fear learning channelrhodopsin chr2 later optically reactivated neurons different context mice showed increased freezing upon light stimulation indicating light-induced fear memory recall freezing detected non-fear-conditioned mice expressing chr2 similar proportion cells fear-conditioned mice cells labelled enhanced yellow fluorescent protein instead chr2 finally activation cells labelled context associated fear evoke freezing mice previously fear-conditioned different context suggesting light-induced fear memory recall context-specific together findings indicate activating sparse specific ensemble hippocampal neurons contribute memory engram sufficient recall memory moreover experimental approach offers general method mapping cellular populations bearing memory engrams
