coherent two-dimensional nanoscopy
introduce spectroscopic method determines nonlinear quantum mechanical response functions beyond optical diffraction limit allows direct imaging nanoscale coherence established coherent two-dimensional 2d spectroscopy four-wave-mixing responses measured using three ingoing waves one outgoing wave thus method diffraction-limited spatial resolution coherent 2d nanoscopy use four ingoing waves detect final state via photoemission electron microscopy nanometer spatial resolution recorded local nanospectra corrugated silver surface observed subwavelength 2d line shape variations plasmonic phase coherence localized excitations persisted femtoseconds exhibited coherent beats observations best explained model coupled oscillators lead fano-like resonances hybridized dark-and bright-mode response
