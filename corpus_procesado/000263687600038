synchronous hyperactivity intercellular calcium waves astrocytes alzheimer mice
although senile plaques focally disrupt neuronal health functional response astrocytes alzheimers disease pathology unknown using multiphoton fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy vivo quantitatively imaged astrocytic calcium homeostasis mouse model alzheimers disease resting calcium globally elevated astrocytic network independent proximity individual plaques time-lapse imaging revealed calcium transients astrocytes frequent synchronously coordinated across long distances uncoupled neuronal activity furthermore rare intercellular calcium waves observed mice amyloid-beta plaques originating near plaques spreading radially least micrometers thus although neurotoxicity observed near amyloid-beta deposits exists general astrocyte-based network response focal pathology
