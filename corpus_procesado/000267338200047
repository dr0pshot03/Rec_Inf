ventral tegmental area bdnf induces opiate-dependent-like reward state naive rats 
neural mechanisms underlying transition drug-nondependent drug-dependent state remain elusive chronic exposure drugs shown increase brain-derived neurotrophic factor bdnf levels ventral tegmental area vta neurons bdnf infusions vta potentiate several behavioral effects drugs including psychomotor sensitization cue-induced drug seeking found single infusion bdnf vta promotes shift dopamine-independent dopamine-dependent opiate reward system identical seen opiate-naive rat becomes dependent withdrawn shift involves switch gamma-aminobutyric acid type gabaa receptors vta gabaergic neurons inhibitory excitatory signaling
