mechanism limiting centrosome duplication per cell cycle 
centrosome organizes microtubule cytoskeleton consists pair centrioles surrounded pericentriolar material cells begin cell cycle single centrosome duplicates mitosis duplication new centrioles grow orthogonally existing ones remain engaged tightly opposed centrioles late mitosis early g1 phase become disengaged relationship centriole engagement/disengagement centriole duplication potential understood mechanisms control processes known show centriole disengagement requires protease separase anaphase disengagement licences centriole duplication next cell cycle describe vitro system using xenopus egg extract purified centrioles centriole disengagement centriole growth occur centriole disengagement anaphase independent mitotic exit cdk2/cyclin e activity requires anaphase-promoting complex separase contrast disengagement new centriole growth occurs interphase dependent cdk2/cyclin e requires previously disengaged centrioles suggests re-duplication centrioles within cell cycle prevented centriole engagement propose once-only control centrosome duplication achieved temporally separating licensing anaphase growth new centrioles s phase involvement separase centriole disengagement sister chromatid separation prevent premature centriole disengagement anaphase onset can lead multipolar spindles genomic instability
