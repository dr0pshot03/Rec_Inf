paracrine wingless signalling controls self-renewal drosophila intestinal stem cells 
drosophila midgut multipotent intestinal stem cells iscs scattered along epithelial basement membrane maintain tissue homeostasis ability steadily produce daughters differentiate either enterocytes enteroendocrine cells depending levels notch activity1- however mechanisms controlling isc self renewal remain elusive show canonical wnt signalling pathway controls isc self-renewal ligand wingless wg specifically expressed circular muscles next iscs separated thin layer basement membrane reduced function wg causes isc quiescence differentiation whereas wg overexpression produces excessive isc like cells express high levels notch ligand delta clonal analysis shows main downstream components wg pathway including frizzled dishevelled armadillo autonomously required isc self renewal furthermore epistatic analysis suggests notch acts downstream wg pathway hierarchy wg/notch signalling pathways controls balance self renewal differentiation iscs data suggest underlying circular muscle constitutes isc niche produce wg signals act directly iscs promote isc self-renewal study demonstrates markedly conserved mechanisms regulating iscs drosophila mammals identification drosophila isc niche principal self renewal signal will facilitate understanding intestinal homeostasis control tumorigenesis
