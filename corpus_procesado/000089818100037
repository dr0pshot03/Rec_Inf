optical gain stimulated emission nanocrystal quantum dots
development optical gain chemically synthesized semiconductor nanoparticles nanocrystal quantum dots intensely studied first step toward nanocrystal quantum dot lasers examined competing dynamical processes involved optical amplification lasing nanocrystal quantum dots found despite highly efficient intrinsic nonradiative auger recombination large optical gain can developed wavelength emitting transition close-packed solids dots narrowband stimulated emission pronounced gain threshold wavelengths tunable size nanocrystal observed expected quantum confinement effects results unambiguously demonstrate feasibility nanocrystal quantum dot lasers
