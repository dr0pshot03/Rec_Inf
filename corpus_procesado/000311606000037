visualizing transient low-populated structures rna 
visualization rna conformational changes provided fundamental insights regulatory rnas carry biological functions rna structural transitions characterized far involve long-lived species can captured structure characterization techniques report nuclear magnetic resonance visualization rna transitions towards invisible excited states ess exist little abundance -% short duration ms allow structural characterization conventional techniques transitions towards ess result localized rearrangements base-pairing alter building block elements rna architecture including helix-junction-helix motifs apical loops es can inhibit function sequestering residues involved recognition signalling promote atp-independent strand exchange thus rnas adopt single conformation rather exist rapid equilibrium alternative ess can stabilized cellular cues affect functional outcomes
