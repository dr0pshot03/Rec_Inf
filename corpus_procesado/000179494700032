high brightness electron beam multi-walled carbon nanotube 
carbon nanotubes can act electron sources rigid structures making particularly interesting use point electron sources high-resolution electron-beam instruments promising results reported respect important requirements applications: stable emitted current long lifetime two parameters electron source affect resolution instruments: energy spread emitted electrons parameter called reduced brightness depends angular current density virtual source size several authors measured low energy spread associated electron emission measure reduced brightness find value factor ten larger provided state-of-the-art electron sources electron microscopes addition show individual multi-walled carbon nanotube emits current single narrow beam basis results expect carbon nanotube electron sources will lead significant improvement performance high-resolution electron-beam instruments
