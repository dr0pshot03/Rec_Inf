morphological disparity ammonoids mark permian mass extinctions 
taxonomic diversity ammonoids terms number taxa preserved provides incomplete picture extinction pattern permian strongly biased fossil record analysis morphological disparity variety shell shapes powerful complementary tool testing hypotheses selectivity extinction permits recognition three distinct patterns first trend decreasing disparity ranging million years led minimum disparity immediately permian-triassic boundary second strongly selective capitanian crisis fits model background extinction driven standard environmental changes third end-permian mass extinction operated random nonselective sorting morphologies consistent catastrophic cause
