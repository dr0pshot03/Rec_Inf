dissociative hydrogen adsorption palladium requires aggregates three vacancies
reaction catalyst surface usually interacts constantly fluctuating mix reactants products spectators participate reaction species either promote inhibit activity catalyst molecules adsorb dissociate dynamic conditions often poorly understood example dissociative adsorption diatomic molecule h--a central step many industrially important catalytic processes-is generally assumed require least two adjacent empty atomic adsorption sites vacancies creation active sites h dissociation will thus involve formation individual vacancies subsequent diffusion aggregation- coupling events determining activity catalyst surface even though active sites central component reaction models processes controlling formation hence activity catalyst surface never captured experimentally report scanning tunnelling microscopy observations transient formation active sites dissociative adsorption h molecules palladium surface find contrary conventional thinking two-vacancy sites seem inactive aggregates three hydrogen vacancies required efficient h dissociation
