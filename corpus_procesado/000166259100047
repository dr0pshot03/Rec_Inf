broad-spectrum mildew resistance arabidopsis thaliana mediated rpw8
plant disease resistance r genes control recognition specific pathogens activate subsequent defense responses show arabidopsis thaliana locus resistance powdery mildew8 rpw8 contains two naturally polymorphic dominant r genes rpw8 rpw8 individually control resistance broad range powdery mildew pathogens although predicted rpw8 rpw8 proteins different previously characterized r proteins induce localized salicylic acid-dependent defenses similar induced r genes control specific resistance apparently broad-spectrum resistance mediated rpw8 uses mechanisms specific resistance
