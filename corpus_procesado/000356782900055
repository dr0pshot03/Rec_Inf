ubix flavin prenyltransferase required bacterial ubiquinone biosynthesis 
ubiquinone also known coenzyme q ubiquitous lipid-soluble redox cofactor essential component electron transfer chains1 eleven genes implicated bacterial ubiquinone biosynthesis including ubix ubid responsible decarboxylation -octaprenyl--hydroxy-benzoate precursor2 despite structural biochemical characterization ubix flavin mononucleotide fmn-binding protein decarboxylase activity detected34 report ubix produces novel flavin-derived cofactor required decarboxylase activity ubid5 ubix acts flavin prenyltransferase linking dimethylallyl moiety flavin n5 c6 atoms adds fourth non-aromatic ring flavin isoalloxazine group contrast prenyltransferases67 ubix metal-independent requires dimethylallyl-monophosphate substrate kinetic crystallography reveals prenyltransferase mechanism ubix resembles terpene synthases8 active site environment dominated pi systems assist phosphate-c1 bond breakage following fmn reduction leading formation n5-c1 bond ubix acts chaperone adduct reorientation via transient carbocation species leading ultimately formation dimethylallyl c3-c6 bond findings establish mechanism formation new flavin-derived cofactor extending flavin terpenoid biochemical repertoires
