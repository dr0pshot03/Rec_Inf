creb coactivator torc2 key regulator fasting glucose metabolism 
glucose homeostasis regulated systemically hormones insulin glucagon cellular level energy status glucagon enhances glucose output liver fasting stimulating transcription gluconeogenic genes via cyclic amp-inducible factor creb cre binding protein cellular atp levels low however energy-sensing kinase ampk inhibits hepatic gluconeogenesis unknown mechanism show hormonal energy-sensing pathways converge coactivator torc2 transducer regulated creb activity modulate glucose output sequestered cytoplasm feeding conditions torc2 dephosphorylated transported nucleus enhances creb-dependent transcription response fasting stimuli conversely signals activate ampk attenuate gluconeogenic programme promoting torc2 phosphorylation blocking nuclear accumulation individuals type diabetes often exhibit fasting hyperglycaemia due elevated gluconeogenesis; compounds enhance torc2 phosphorylation may offer therapeutic benefits setting
