gamma-ray emission shell supernova remnant w44 revealed fermi lat
recent observations supernova remnants snrs hint accelerate cosmic rays energies close similar electron volts however nature particles produce emission remains ambiguous report observations snr w44 fermi large area telescope energies x electron volts x electron volts detection source morphology corresponding snr shell implies emission produced particles accelerated gamma-ray spectrum well modeled emission protons nuclei steepening similar electron volts provides probe study particle acceleration responds environmental effects shock propagation dense clouds accelerated particles released interstellar space
