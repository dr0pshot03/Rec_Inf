structural basis protein antiaggregation activity trigger factor chaperone 
molecular chaperones prevent aggregation misfolding proteins scarcity structural data impeded understanding recognition antiaggregation mechanisms report solution structure dynamics energetics three trigger factor tf chaperone molecules complex alkaline phosphatase phoa captured unfolded state data show tf uses multiple sites bind several regions phoa substrate protein primarily hydrophobic contacts nuclear magnetic resonance nmr relaxation experiments show tf interacts phoa highly dynamic fashion number length phoa regions engaged tf increase stable complex gradually emerges multivalent binding keeps substrate protein extended unfolded conformation results show molecular chaperones recognize unfolded polypeptides acting unfoldases holdases prevent aggregation premature misfolding unfolded proteins
