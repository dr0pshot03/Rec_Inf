spindle multipolarity prevented centrosomal clustering 
tumor cells characterized increased genomic instability chromosome segregational defects often associated hyperamplification centrosome formation multipolar spindles however extra centrosomes always lead multipolarity describe process centrosomal clustering prevented formation multipolar spindles noncancer cells noncancer cells needed overcome clustering mechanism allow multipolar spindles form high frequency microtubule motor cytoplasmic dynein critical part coalescing machinery tumor cells overexpression spindle protein numa interfered dynein localization promoting multipolarity
