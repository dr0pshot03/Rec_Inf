functional link brca1 ataxia telangiectasia gene product dna damage response 
brca1 encodes familial breast cancer suppressor critical role cellular responses dna damage mouse cells deficient brca1 show genetic instability defective g2-m checkpoint control reduced homologous recombination brca1 also directly interacts proteins dna repair machinery regulates expression p21 gadd45 genes- however remains unclear dna damage signals transmitted modulate repair function brca1 show brca1-associated protein ctip- becomes hyperphosphorylated dissociated brca1 upon ionizing radiation phosphorylation event requires protein kinase atm mutated disease ataxia telangiectasia atm phosphorylates ctip serine residues mutation sites alanine abrogates dissociation brca1 ctip resulting persistent repression brca1-dependent induction gadd45 upon ionizing radiation conclude atm phosphorylating ctip upon ionizing radiation may modulate brca1-mediated regulation dna damage-response gadd45 gene thus providing potential link atm deficiency breast cancer
