direct reprogramming somatic cells promoted maternal transcription factor glis1
induced pluripotent stem cells ipscs generated somatic cells transgenic expression three transcription factors collectively called osk: oct3/ also called pou5f1 sox2 klf4 however conversion ipscs inefficient protooncogene myc enhances efficiency ipsc generation osk also increases tumorigenicity resulting ipscs show gli-like transcription factor glis1 glis family zinc finger markedly enhances generation ipscs mouse human fibroblasts expressed together osk mouse ipscs generated using combination transcription factors can form germline-competent chimaeras glis1 enriched unfertilized oocytes embryos one-cell stage dna microarray analyses show glis1 promotes multiple pro-reprogramming pathways including myc nanog lin28 wnt essrb mesenchymal-epithelial transition results therefore show glis1 effectively promotes direct reprogramming somatic cells ipsc generation
