dislocations bilayer graphene 
dislocations represent one fascinating fundamental concepts materials science1- importantly dislocations main carriers plastic deformation crystalline materials4- furthermore can strongly affect local electronic optical properties semiconductors ionic crystals78 materials small dimensions experience extensive image forces attract surface release strain energy9 however layered crystals graphite dislocation movement mainly restricted basal plane thus dislocations escape enabling confinement crystals thin two monolayers explore nature dislocations extreme boundary conditions material choice bilayer graphene thinnest possible quasi-two-dimensional crystal linear defects can confined homogeneous robust graphene membranes derived high-quality epitaxial graphene silicon carbide10 provide ideal platform investigation report direct observation basal-plane dislocations freestanding bilayer graphene using transmission electron microscopy detailed investigation diffraction contrast analysis atomistic simulations investigation reveals two striking size effects first absence stacking-fault energy unique property bilayer graphene leads characteristic dislocation pattern corresponds alternating ab <-> ac change stacking order second experiments combination atomistic simulations reveal pronounced buckling bilayer graphene membrane results directly accommodation strain fact buckling changes strain state bilayer graphene key importance electronic properties11- findings will contribute understanding dislocations role structural mechanical electronic properties bilayer few-layer graphene
