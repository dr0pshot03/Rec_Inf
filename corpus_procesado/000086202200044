structure rna polymerase domain e-coli primase 
cellular organisms use specialized rna polymerases called "primases" synthesize rna primers initiation dna replication high-resolution crystal structure primase comprising catalytic core escherichia coli dnag protein determined core structure contains active-site architecture unrelated dna rna polymerase palm folds instead related "toprim" fold basis structure likely dnag binds nucleic acid groove clustered invariant residues dnag positioned within replisome accept single-stranded dna directly replicative helicase
