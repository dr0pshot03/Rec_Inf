optical control protein activity fluorescent protein domains 
fluorescent proteins fps widely used optical sensors whereas light-absorbing domains used optical control protein localization activity describe light-dependent dissociation association mutant photochromic fp dronpa used control protein activities light created fluorescent light-inducible protein design dronpa domains fused termini enzyme domain dark dronpa domains associate cage protein light induces dronpa dissociation activates protein method enabled optical control guanine nucleotide exchange factor protease domains without extensive screening findings extend applications fps exclusively sensing functions also encompass optogenetic control
