mechanism divergent growth factor effects mesenchymal stem cell differentiation 
closely related signals often lead different cellular outcomes found differentiation human mesenchymal stem cells bone-forming cells stimulated epidermal growth factor egf platelet-derived growth factor pdgf used mass spectrometry-based proteomics comprehensively compare proteins tyrosine phosphorylated response egf pdgf associated partners % signaling proteins used ligands whereas phosphatidylinositol -kinase pi3k pathway exclusively activated pdgf implicating possible control point indeed chemical inhibition pi3k pdgf-stimulated cells removed differential effect two growth factors bestowing full differentiation effect onto pdgf thus quantitative proteomics can directly compare entire signaling networks discover critical differences capable changing cell fate
