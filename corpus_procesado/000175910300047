new uag-encoded residue structure methanogen methyltransferase
genes encoding methanogenic methylamine methyltransferases contain in-frame amber uag codon read translation identified uag-encoded residue angstrom resolution structure methanosarcina barkeri monomethylamine methyltransferase mtmb structure reveals homohexamer comprised individual subunits tim barrel fold electron density uag-encoded residue distinct natural amino acids instead appears consistent lysine amide-linkage 4rsr--substituted-pyrroline--carboxylate suggest amino acid named l-pyrrolysine
