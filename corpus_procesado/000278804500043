ubiquitin-dependent dna damage bypass separable genome replication 
post-replication repair prr pathway allows cells bypass overcome lesions dna replication eukaryotes damage bypass activated ubiquitylation replication clamp pcna components rad6 pathway whereas monoubiquitylation pcna allows mutagenic translesion synthesis damage-tolerant dna polymerases- polyubiquitylation required error-free pathway probably involves template switch undamaged sister chromatid timing prr events cell cycle location relative replication forks well factors required downstream pcna ubiquitylation remained poorly characterized demonstrate rad6 pathway normally operates s phase however using inducible system dna damage bypass budding yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae show process separable time space genome replication thus allowing direct visualization quantification productive prr tracts found s phase ultraviolet-radiation-induced lesions bypassed predominantly via translesion synthesis whereas error-free pathway functions backup system approach revealed distribution prr tracts synchronized cell population will allow in-depth mechanistic analysis cells manage processing lesions genomes replication
