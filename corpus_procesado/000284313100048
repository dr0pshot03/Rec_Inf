integrating carbon-halogen bond formation medicinal plant metabolism 
halogenation considered rare occurrence nature now observed many natural product biosynthetic pathways however small fraction halogenated compounds isolated terrestrial plants given impact halogenation can biological activity natural products reasoned introduction halides medicinal plant metabolism provide opportunity rationally bioengineer broad variety novel plant products altered perhaps improved pharmacological properties report chlorination biosynthetic machinery soil bacteria can successfully introduced medicinal plant catharanthus roseus madagascar periwinkle prokaryotic halogenases function within context plant cell generate chlorinated tryptophan shuttled monoterpene indole alkaloid metabolism yield chlorinated alkaloids new functional group-a halide-is thereby introduced complex metabolism c roseus incorporated predictable regioselective manner onto plant alkaloid products medicinal plants despite genetic developmental complexity therefore seem viable platform synthetic biology efforts
