genetic analysis digestive physiology using fluorescent phospholipid reporters 
zebrafish valuable model mammalian lipid metabolism; larvae process lipids similarly intestine hepatobiliary system respond drugs block cholesterol synthesis humans ingestion fluorescently quenched phospholipids endogenous lipase activity rapid transport cleavage products results intense gall bladder fluorescence genetic screening identifies zebrafish mutants fat free show normal digestive organ morphology severely reduced phospholipid cholesterol processing thus fluorescent lipids provide sensitive readout lipid metabolism powerful tool identifying genes mediate vertebrate digestive physiology
