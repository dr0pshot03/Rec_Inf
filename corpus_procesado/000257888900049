molecular determinant establishment sister chromatid cohesion
chromosome segregation transcriptional regulation repair dna double strand breaks require cohesin protein complex cohesin holds replicated chromosomes sister chromatids together mediate sister chromatid cohesion mechanism cohesion established unknown found budding yeast head domain smc3p subunit cohesin acetylated eco1p acetyltransferase two evolutionarily conserved residues promoting chromatin bound cohesin tether sister chromatids smc3p acetylation induced s phase chromatin loading cohesin suppressed g g/m smc3 head acetylation cell cycle regulation provide important insights biology mechanism cohesion establishment
