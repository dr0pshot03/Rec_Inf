clamping mechanism involved snare-dependent exocytosis 
neurotransmitter release synapse influx calcium ions stimulates release neurotransmitter however mechanism synaptic vesicle fusion coupled calcium unclear despite identification core fusion machinery [soluble n-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor snare] principal calcium sensor synaptotagmin describe may represent basic principle coupling mechanism: reversible clamping protein complexin can freeze snarepin assembled fusion-competent intermediate en route fusion calcium binds calcium sensor synaptotagmin clamp released snare proteins key regulators like synaptotagmin complexin can ectopically expressed cell surface celts expressing flipped synaptic snares fuse constitutively coexpressed complexin fusion blocked adding back calcium triggered fusion intermediate presence synaptotagmin
