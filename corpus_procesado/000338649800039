quasiparticle engineering entanglement propagation quantum many-body system
key explaining controlling range quantum phenomena study information propagates around many-body systems quantum dynamics can described particle-like carriers information emerge collective behaviour underlying system so-called quasiparticles elementary excitations predicted distribute quantum information fashion determined systems interactions report quasiparticle dynamics observed quantum many-body system trapped atomic ions first observe entanglement distributed quasiparticles trace light-cone-like wavefronts- second using ability tune interaction range system observe information propagation experimental regime effective-light-cone picture apply results will enable experimental studies range quantum phenomena including transport thermalization localization entanglement growth represent first step towards newquantum-optic regime engineered quasiparticles tunable nonlinear interactions
