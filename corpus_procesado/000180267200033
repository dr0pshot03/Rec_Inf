early lunar core dynamo driven thermochemical mantle convection
although moon currently internally generated magnetic field palaeomagnetic data combined radiometric ages apollo samples provide evidence magnetic field similar to3 billion years gyr ago possibly owing ancient lunar dynamo presence lunar dynamo time period difficult explain- thermal evolution models moon yield insufficient core heat flux power dynamo similar to4 gyr ago show transient increase core heat flux overturn initially stratified lunar mantle might explain existence timing early lunar dynamo using three-dimensional spherical convection model show dense layer enriched radioactive elements thermal blanket base lunar mantle can initially prevent core cooling thereby inhibiting core convection magnetic field generation subsequent radioactive heating progressively increases buoyancy thermal blanket ultimately causing rise back mantle removal thermal blanket proposed explain eruption thorium titanium-rich lunar mare basalts plausibly results core heat flux sufficient power short-lived lunar dynamo
