axon regeneration requires conserved map kinase pathway 
regeneration injured neurons can restore function neurons regenerate poorly failure regenerate cases due lack activation cell intrinsic regeneration pathways pathways might targeted development therapies can restore neuron function injury disease show dlk mitogen-activated protein map kinase pathway essential regeneration caenorhabditis elegans motor neurons loss pathway eliminates regeneration whereas activating improves regeneration proteins also regulate later step growth cone migration conclude axon injury activation map kinase cascade required switch mature neuron aplastic state state capable growth
