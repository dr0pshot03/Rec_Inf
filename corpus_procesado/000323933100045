neuroendocrine control drosophila larval light preference
animal development coupled innate behaviors maximize chances survival show prothoracicotropic hormone ptth neuropeptide controls developmental transition juvenile stage sexual maturation also regulates light avoidance drosophila melanogaster larvae ptth receptor torso acts two light sensors-the bolwigs organ peripheral class iv dendritic arborization neurons-to regulate light avoidance found ptth concomitantly promotes steroidogenesis light avoidance end larval stage driving animals toward darker environment initiate immobile maturation phase thus ptth controls decisions animals undergo metamorphosis optimizing conditions adult development
