uncoupling leading lagging-strand dna replication lesion bypass vivo
numerous agents attack dna forming lesions impair normal replication specialized dna polymerases transiently replace replicative polymerase copy past lesions thus generating mutations major initiating cause cancer monitored escherichia coli kinetics replication strands dna molecules containing single replication block either leading lagging strand despite block leading strand lagging-strand synthesis proceeded implying transient uncoupling concurrent strand synthesis replication lesion requires specialized dna polymerases achieved similar kinetics efficiencies strands
