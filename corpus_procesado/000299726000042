maternal paternal genomes contribute equally transcriptome early plant embryos 
animals maternal gene products deposited eggs regulate embryonic development activation zygotic genome1 plants analogous period prolonged maternal control embryogenesis thought occur based gene-expression studies2- however gene-expression studies genetic analyses show transcripts must derive early zygotic genome7- implying prevailing model fully explain nature zygotic genome activation plants determine maternal paternal zygotic contributions early embryonic transcriptome sequenced transcripts hybrid embryos crosses two polymorphic inbred lines arabidopsis thaliana used single-nucleotide polymorphisms diagnostic parental line quantify parental contributions although transcripts seemed either inherited primarily one parent transcribed imprinted loci vast majority transcripts produced near-equal amounts maternal paternal alleles even initial stages embryogenesis results reporter experiments analyses transcripts genes expressed sperm egg indicate early widespread zygotic transcription thus contrast early animal embryogenesis early plant embryogenesis mostly zygotic control
