observation interpretation time-delayed mechanism hydrogen exchange reaction
extensive theoretical- experimental- studies shown hydrogen exchange reaction h + h -> h + h occur predominantly direct recoil mechanism: h-h bonds break form concertedly system passes straight collinear transition state recoil collision causing h product molecules scatter backward theoretical predictions agree well experimental observations scattering process- indirect exchange mechanisms involving h intermediates suggested occur well- difficult test bimolecular reactions studied femtosecond spectroscopies used monitor unimolecular reactions moreover full quantum simulations time evolution bimolecular reactions performed isotopic variant hydrogen exchange reaction h + d -> hd + d forward scattering features observed product angular distribution attributed possible scattering resonances associated quasibound collision complex extend measurements wide range collision energies interpret results using full time-dependent quantum simulation reaction thus showing two different reaction mechanisms modulate measured product angular distribution features one mechanisms direct leads backward scattering indirect leads forward scattering delay femtoseconds
