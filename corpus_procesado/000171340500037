warm tropical sea surface temperatures late cretaceous eocene epochs
climate models increased levels carbon dioxide predict global warming causes heating tropics investigations ancient climates based palaeodata generally indicated cool tropical temperatures supposed greenhouse episodes example late cretaceous eocene epochs abundant geological evidence warm mostly ice-free poles tropical sea surface temperatures generally estimated degreesc based oxygen isotope palaeothermometry surface-dwelling planktonic foraminifer shells question validity data grounds poor preservation diagenetic alteration present new data exceptionally well preserved foraminifer shells extracted impermeable clay-rich sediments indicate intervals studied tropical sea surface temperatures least degreesc warm temperatures line understanding geographical distributions temperature-sensitive fossil organisms results climate models increased co2 levels
