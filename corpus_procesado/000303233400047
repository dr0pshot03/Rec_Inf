function molecular mechanism acetylation autophagy regulation
protein acetylation emerged key regulatory mechanism many cellular processes used genetic analysis saccharomyces cerevisiae identify esa1 histone acetyltransferase required autophagy identified autophagy signaling component atg3 substrate esa1 specifically acetylation k19 k48 atg3 regulated autophagy controlling atg3 atg8 interaction lipidation atg8 starvation induced transient k19-k48 acetylation spatial temporal regulation localization acetylase esa1 deacetylase rpd3 pre-autophagosomal structures pass interaction atg3 attenuation k19-k48 acetylation associated attenuation autophagy increased k19-k48 acetylation deletion deacetylase rpd3 caused increased autophagy thus protein acetylation contributes control autophagy
