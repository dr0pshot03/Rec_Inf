widespread origins domestic horse lineages 
domestication entails control wild species generally regarded complex process confined restricted area culture previous dna sequence analyses several domestic species suggested limited number origination events analyzed mitochondrial dna mtdna control region sequences domestic horses found high diversity matrilines sequence analysis equids archaeological sites late pleistocene deposits showed diversity due accelerated mutation rate ancient domestication event consequently high mtdna sequence diversity horses implies unprecedented widespread integration matrilines extensive utilization taming wild horses however genetic variation nuclear markers partitioned among horse breeds may reflect sex-biased dispersal breeding
