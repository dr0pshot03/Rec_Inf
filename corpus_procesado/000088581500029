crystal structure rhodopsin: g protein-coupled receptor
heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding protein g protein-coupled receptors gpcrs respond variety different external stimuli activate g proteins gpcrs share many structural features including bundle seven transmembrane alpha helices connected six loops varying lengths determined structure rhodopsin diffraction data extending angstroms resolution highly organized structure extracellular region including conserved disulfide bridge forms basis arrangement seven-helix transmembrane motif ground-state chromophore il-cis-retinal holds transmembrane region protein inactive conformation interactions chromophore cluster key residues determine wavelength maximum absorption changes interactions among rhodopsins facilitate color discrimination identification set residues mediate interactions transmembrane helices cytoplasmic surface c-protein activation occurs also suggests possible structural change upon photoactivation
