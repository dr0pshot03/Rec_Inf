fragility liquid embedded properties glass
liquid cooled melting temperature usually crystallizes however quenching rate fast enough system may remain disordered state progressively losing fluidity upon cooling time needed rearrangement local atomic structure reaches approximately seconds system becomes solid practical purpose defines glass transition temperature t-g approaching transition liquid side different systems show qualitatively different temperature dependencies viscosity accordingly classified introducing concept fragility report experimental observations relate microscopic properties glassy phase fragility find vibrational properties glass well t-g correlated fragility value consequently extend fragility concept glassy state indicate determine fragility uniquely glass properties well t-g
