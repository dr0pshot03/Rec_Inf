spatial temporal distribution mass loss greenland ice sheet since ad
response greenland ice sheet gis changes temperature twentieth century remains contentious largely owing difficulties estimating spatial temporal distribution ice mass changes greenland-wide observations first became available previous estimates change twentieth century based empirical modelling- energy balance modelling consequently observation-based estimates contribution gis global-mean sea level budget included fifth assessment report intergovernmental panel climate change calculate spatial ice mass loss around entire gis present using aerial imagery 1980s allows accurate high-resolution mapping geomorphic features related maximum extent gis little ice age end nineteenth century estimate total ice mass loss spatial distribution three periods: +/ gigatonnes per year +/ gigatonnes per year +/ gigatonnes per year furthermore using two surface mass balance models partition mass balance term surface mass balance total precipitation minus total sublimation minus runoff dynamic term find many areas currently undergoing change identical experienced considerable thinning throughout twentieth century also reveal surface mass balance term shows considerable decrease since whereas dynamic term constant past years overall observation-based findings show twentieth century gis contributed least +/ millimetres global-mean sea level rise result will help close twentieth-century sea level budget remains crucial evaluating reliability models used predict global sea level rise
