high direct estimate mutation rate mitochondrial genome caenorhabditis elegans 
mutations mitochondrial genome implicated numerous human genetic disorders offer important data phylogenetic forensic population genetic studies using long-term series caenorhabditis elegans mutation accumulation lines performed wide-scale screen mutations mitochondrial genome revealed mutation rate two orders magnitude higher previous indirect estimates highly biased mutational spectrum multiple mutations affecting coding function welt mutational hotspots homopolymeric nucleotide stretches
