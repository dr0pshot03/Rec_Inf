aryl hydrocarbon receptor antagonists promote expansion human hematopoietic stem cells 
although practiced clinically years use hematopoietic stem cell hsc transplants remains limited ability expand cells ex vivo unbiased screen primary human hscs identified purine derivative stemregenin sr1 promotes ex vivo expansion cd34+ cells culture hscs sr1 led -fold increase cells expressing cd34 -fold increase cells retain ability engraft immunodeficient mice mechanistic studies show sr1 acts antagonizing aryl hydrocarbon receptor ahr identification sr1 ahr modulation means induce ex vivo hsc expansion facilitate clinical use hsc therapy
