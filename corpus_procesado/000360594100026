structural insights bacterial carbon-phosphorus lyase machinery 
phosphorus required life microorganisms can extract environment several metabolic pathways phosphate limited supply bacteria able use phosphonate compounds require specialized enzymatic machinery break stable carbon-phosphorus c-p bond despite importance details machinery catabolizes phosphonates remain unknown determine crystal structure kilodalton escherichia coli c-p lyase core complex phng-phnh-phni-phnj phnghij show two-fold symmetric hetero-octamer comprising intertwined network subunits unexpected self-homologies contains two potential active sites probably couple phosphonate compounds atp subsequently hydrolyse c-p bond map binding site phnk complex using electron microscopy show binds conserved insertion domain phnj results provide structural basis understanding microbial phosphonate breakdown
