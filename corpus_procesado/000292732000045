precise manipulation chromosomes vivo enables genome-wide codon replacement 
present genome engineering technologies capable fundamentally reengineering genomes nucleotide megabase scale used multiplex automated genome engineering mage site-specifically replace tag stop codons synonymous taa codons parallel across escherichia coli strains approach allowed us measure individual recombination frequencies confirm viability modification identify associated phenotypes developed hierarchical conjugative assembly genome engineering cage merge sets codon modifications genomes precise changes demonstrate synonymous codon substitutions can combined higher-order strains without synthetic lethal effects methods treat chromosome editable evolvable template permitting exploration vast genetic landscapes
