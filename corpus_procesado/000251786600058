treatment sickle cell anemia mouse model ips cells generated autologous skin 
recently demonstrated mouse human fibroblasts can reprogrammed embryonic stem cell like state introducing combinations four transcription factors however therapeutic potential induced pluripotent stem ips cells remained undefined using humanized sickle cell anemia mouse model show mice can rescued transplantation hematopoietic progenitors obtained vitro autologous ips cells achieved correction human sickle hemoglobin allele gene specific targeting results provide proof principle using transcription factor induced reprogramming combined gene cell therapy disease treatment mice problems associated using retroviruses oncogenes reprogramming need resolved ips cells can considered human therapy
