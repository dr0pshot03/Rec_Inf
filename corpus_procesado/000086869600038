evidence brainstem structures participating oculomotor integration
cerebellar flocculus implicated vestibulo-oculomotor control one major central input structure originates brainstem cells paramedian tract pmt whose function unknown reported pmt cells pens carry vestibular eye movement signals pharmacological inactivation produces leaky integrator combined vestibular imbalance results suggest pmt cells provide cerebellum sensory motor signals essential velocity-to-position integration common premotor process required motor systems
