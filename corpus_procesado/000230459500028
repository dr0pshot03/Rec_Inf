common mechanisms nerve blood vessel wiring 
blood vessels nerve fibres course throughout body orderly pattern often alongside one another although superficially distinct mechanisms involved wiring neural vascular networks seem share deep similarities discovery key axon guidance molecules past decade shown axons guided targets finely tuned codes attractive repulsive cues recent studies reveal cues also help blood vessels navigate targets parallels also emerged actions growth factors direct angiogenic sprouting regulate axon terminal arborization
