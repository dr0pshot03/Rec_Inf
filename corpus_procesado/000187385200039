adaptation limits diversification experimental bacterial populations
adaptation specific niche theoretically constrains populations ability subsequently diversify niches tested theory using bacterium pseudomonas fluorescens diversifies niche specialists propagated laboratory microcosms numerically dominant genotypes allowed diversify isolation predicted populations increased fitness time showed greatly decreased ability diversify subsequent experiments demonstrated niche generalists reductions intrinsic evolvability responsible data results show niche specialization may come cost reduced potential diversify
