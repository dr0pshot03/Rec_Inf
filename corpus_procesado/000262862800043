ligand-dependent equilibrium fluctuations single calmodulin molecules 
single molecule force spectroscopy allows superb mechanical control protein conformation used custom built low drift atomic force microscope observe mechanically induced conformational equilibrium fluctuations single molecules eukaryotic calcium dependent signal transducer calmodulin cam data ligand dependence full energy landscape can reconstructed find calcium ions affect folding kinetics individual cam domains whereas target peptides stabilize already folded structure single molecule data full length cam reveal wasp venom peptide binds noncooperatively cam : stoichiometry whereas target enzyme peptide binds cooperatively : stoichiometry mechanical load applied directly target peptide real time binding/ unbinding transitions can observed
