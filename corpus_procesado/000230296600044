doping semiconductor nanocrystals 
doping-the intentional introduction impurities material-is fundamental controlling properties bulk semiconductors stimulated similar efforts dope semiconductor nanocrystals1- despite successes5- many efforts failed reasons remain unclear example mn can incorporated nanocrystals cds znse refs - cdse ref -despite comparable bulk solubilities near per cent difficulties hindered development new nanocrystalline materials13- often attributed self-purification allegedly intrinsic mechanism whereby impurities expelled show instead underlying mechanism controls doping initial adsorption impurities nanocrystal surface growth find adsorption-and therefore doping efficiency-is determined three main factors: surface morphology nanocrystal shape surfactants growth solution calculated mn adsorption energies equilibrium shapes several nanocrystals lead specific doping predictions confirmed measuring mn concentration znse varies nanocrystal size shape finally use predictions incorporate mn previously undopable cdse nanocrystals success establishes earlier difficulties doping intrinsic suggests variety doped nanocrystals-for applications solar cells16 spintronics17-can anticipated
