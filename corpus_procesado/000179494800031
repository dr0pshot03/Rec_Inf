spectral-element method beowulf computing global seismology 
propagation seismic waves earth can now modeled accurately recently developed spectral-element method method takes account heterogeneity earth models three-dimensional variations seismic wave velocity density crustal thickness method implemented relatively inexpensive clusters personal computers so-called beowulf machines combination hardware software enables us simulate broadband seismograms without intrinsic restrictions level heterogeneity frequency content
