metabolic activity subsurface life deep-sea sediments 
global maps sulfate methane marine sediments reveal two provinces subsurface metabolic activity: sulfate-rich open-ocean province ocean-margin province sulfate limited shallow sediments methane produced regions abundant sulfate-depleted sediments metabolic activity greatest narrow zones sulfate-reducing methane oxidation along ocean margins metabolic rates subseafloor life orders magnitude lower life earths surface microorganisms subseafloor sediments either inactive adapted extraordinarily low metabolic activity
