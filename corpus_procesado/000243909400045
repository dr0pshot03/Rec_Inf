rtt109 acetylates histone h3 lysine functions dna replication 
acetylation histone h3 lysine h3-k56 occurs s phase cells lacking h3-k56 acetylation sensitive dna-damaging agents however histone acetyltransferase hat catalyzes global h3-k56 acetylation found show regulation ty1 transposition gene product rtt109 h3-k56 hat cells lacking rtt109 expressing rtt109 mutants alterations conserved aspartate residue lose h3-k56 acetylation exhibit increased sensitivity toward genotoxic agents well elevated levels spontaneous chromosome breaks thus rtt109 shares sequence homology known hats unique hat acetylates h3-k56
