apobec3b enzymatic source mutation breast cancer
several mutations required cancer development genome sequencing revealed many cancers including breast cancer somatic mutation spectra dominated c-to-t transitions- mutations occur hydrolytically disfavoured non-methylated cytosines throughout genome sometimes clustered show dna cytosine deaminase apobec3b probable source mutations apobec3b messenger rna upregulated primary breast tumours breast cancer cell lines tumours express high levels apobec3b twice many mutations express low levels likely mutations tp53 endogenous apobec3b protein predominantly nuclear detectable source dna c-to-u editing activity breast cancer cell-line extracts knockdown experiments show endogenous apobec3b correlates increased levels genomic uracil increased mutation frequencies c-to-t transitions furthermore induced apobec3b overexpression causes cell cycle deviations cell death dna fragmentation gamma-h2ax accumulation c-to-t mutations data suggest model apobec3b-catalysed deamination provides chronic source dna damage breast cancers select tp53 inactivation explain tumours evolve rapidly manifest heterogeneity
