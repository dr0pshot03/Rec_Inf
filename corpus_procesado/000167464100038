guard cell abscisic acid signalling engineering drought hardiness plants 
guard cells located epidermis plant leaves pairs surround stomatal pores control influx co2 raw material photosynthesis water loss plants transpiration atmosphere guard cells become highly developed system dissecting early signal transduction mechanisms plants response drought plants synthesize hormone abscisic acid triggers closing stomata thus reducing water loss recently central regulators guard cell abscisic acid signalling discovered molecular understanding guard cell signal transduction network opens possibilities engineering stomatal responses control co2 intake plant water loss
