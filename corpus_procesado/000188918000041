chondrules peculiar ree patterns: implications solar nebular condensation high c/o
rare earth element ree data two ordinary chondrite chondrules show distinct negative chondrite-normalized concentration anomalies samarium europium ytterbium peculiar patterns may result ree gas/solid fractionation oxygen fugacity lower assumed canonical solar nebula suggest two ordinary chondrite chondrules acquired fractionated ree patterns incorporation highly reduced ultrarefractory condensates precursors interpretation implies high-temperature condensation processes occurred nebular environments strong deficit oxygen regions enhanced carbon/oxygen ratio
