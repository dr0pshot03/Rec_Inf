functional diversity governs ecosystem response nutrient enrichment 
relationship species diversity ecosystem functioning central topic ecology today classical approaches studying ecosystem responses nutrient enrichment considered linear food chains extent ecosystem structure network species interactions affects responses currently unknown severely limits ability predict species functional groups will benefit suffer nutrient enrichment understand underlying mechanisms- approach takes ecosystem complexity account considering functional diversity trophic level- conducted mesocosm experiment test effects nutrient enrichment lake ecosystem developed model intermediate complexity separates trophic levels functional groups according size diet model successfully predicted experimental results whereas linear food-chain models model shows importance functional diversity indirect interactions response ecosystems perturbations indicates new approaches needed management freshwater ecosystems subject eutrophication
