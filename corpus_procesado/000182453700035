glass-to-glass transition end point copolymer micellar system 
present experimental evidence obtained small-angle neutron scattering photon correlation measurements indicating existence two types structurally arrested glassy states copolymer micellar system short-range interparticle attractive interaction within certain range micellar volume fractions sharp transition two types glass observed varying temperature furthermore found end point transition line beyond two glasses become identical local structure long-time dynamics findings confirm recent mode-coupling theory predictions regarding phase behavior structurally arrested states type system
