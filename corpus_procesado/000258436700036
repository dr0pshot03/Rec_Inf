plant immunity requires conformational charges npr1 via s-nitrosylation thioredoxins 
changes redox status observed immune responses different organisms associated signaling mechanisms poorly understood plants redox changes regulate conformation npr1 master regulator salicylic acid sa mediated defense genes npr1 sequestered cytoplasm oligomer intermolecular disulfide bonds report s nitrosylation npr1 s nitrosoglutathione gsno cysteine facilitates oligomerization maintains protein homeostasis upon sa induction conversely sa induced npr1 oligomer monomer reaction catalyzed thioredoxins trxs mutations npr1 cysteine trx compromised npr1 mediated disease resistance thus regulation npr1 opposing action gsno trx findings suggest link pathogen triggered redox changes gene regulation plant immunity
