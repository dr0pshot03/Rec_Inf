biosynthesis plant volatiles: natures diversity ingenuity 
plant volatiles pvs lipophilic molecules high vapor pressure serve various ecological roles synthesis pvs involves removal hydrophilic moieties oxidation/hydroxylation reduction methylation acylation reactions pv biosynthetic enzymes produce multiple products single substrate act multiple substrates genes pv biosynthesis evolve duplication genes direct aspects plant metabolism duplicated genes diverge time changes preferred substrate resultant product pv enzymes may occur minimal changes critical residues convergent evolution often responsible ability distally related species synthesize volatile
