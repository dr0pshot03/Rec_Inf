critical population density triggers rapid formation vast oceanic fish shoals 
similarities behavior diverse animal species form large groups motivated attempts establish general principles governing animal group behavior difficult however make quantitative measurements temporal spatial behavior extensive animal groups wild bird flocks fish shoals locust swarms quantifying formation processes vast oceanic fish shoals spawning show rapid transition disordered highly synchronized behavior occurs population density reaches critical value; ii organized group migration occurs transition; iii small sets leaders significantly influence actions much larger groups findings confirms general theoretical predictions believed apply nature irrespective animal species
