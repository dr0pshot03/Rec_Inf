escrt machinery required plasma membrane repair 
plasma membrane damage can triggered numerous phenomena efficient repair essential cell survival endocytosis membrane patching extracellular budding can used plasma membrane repair found endosomal sorting complex required transport escrt involved previously membrane budding fission plays critical role plasma membrane repair escrt proteins recruited within seconds plasma membrane wounds quantitative analysis wound closure kinetics coupled mathematical modeling suggested escrts involved repair small wounds real-time imaging correlative scanning electron microscopy sem identified extracellular buds shedding site escrt recruitment thus repair certain wounds ensured escrt-mediated extracellular shedding wounded portions
