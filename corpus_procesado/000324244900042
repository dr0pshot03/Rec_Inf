pluripotent genome three dimensions shaped around pluripotency factors
becoming increasingly clear shape genome importantly influences transcription regulation pluripotent stem cells embryonic stem cells recently shown organize chromosomes topological domains largely invariant cell types combine chromatin conformation capture technologies chromatin factor binding data demonstrate inactive chromatin unusually disorganized pluripotent stem-cell nuclei show gene promoters engage contacts topological domains largely tissue-independent manner whereas enhancers tissue-restricted interaction profile notably genomic clusters pluripotency factor binding sites find efficiently manner strictly pluripotent-stem-cell-specific dependent presence oct4 nanog protein inducible artificial recruitment nanog selected chromosomal site conclude pluripotent stem cells unique higher-order genome structure shaped pluripotency factors speculate interactome enhances robustness pluripotent state
