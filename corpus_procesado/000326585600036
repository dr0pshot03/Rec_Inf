x-ray structure dopamine transporter elucidates antidepressant mechanism
antidepressants targeting na+/cl--coupled neurotransmitter uptake define key therapeutic strategy treat clinical depression neuropathic pain however identifying molecular interactions underlie pharmacological activity transport inhibitors thus mechanism inhibitors lead increased synaptic neurotransmitter levels proven elusive present crystal structure drosophila melanogaster dopamine transporter angstrom resolution bound tricyclic antidepressant nortriptyline transporter locked outward-open conformation nortriptyline wedged transmembrane helices blocking transporter binding substrate isomerizing inward-facing conformation although overall structure dopamine transporter similar prokaryotic relative leut multiple distinctions including kink transmembrane helix halfway across membrane bilayer latch-like carboxy-terminal helix caps cytoplasmic gate cholesterol molecule wedged within groove formed transmembrane helices 1a taken together dopamine transporter structure reveals molecular basis antidepressant action sodium-coupled neurotransmitter symporters elucidates critical elements eukaryotic transporter structure modulation lipids thus expanding understanding mechanism regulation neurotransmitter uptake chemical synapses
