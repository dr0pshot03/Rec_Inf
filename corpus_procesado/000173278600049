role diacylglycerol pkd recruitment tgn protein transport plasma membrane
protein kinase d pkd cytosolic serine-threonine kinase binds trans-golgi network tgn regulates fission transport carriers specifically destined cell surface pkd found bind diacylglycerol dag binding necessary recruitment tgn reducing cellular levels dag inhibited pkd recruitment blocked protein transport tgn cell surface thus dag-dependent pkd-mediated signaling regulates formation transport carriers tgn mammalian cells
