reduction aryl halides consecutive visible light-induced electron transfer processes
biological photosynthesis uses energy several visible light photons challenging oxidation water whereas chemical photocatalysis typically involves single-photon excitation perylene bisimide reduced visible light photoinduced electron transfer pet stable colored radical anion report subsequent excitation radical anion accumulates sufficient energy reduction stable aryl chlorides giving aryl radicals trapped hydrogen atom donors used carbon-carbon bond formation consecutive pet conpet overcomes current energetic limitation visible light photoredox catalysis allows photocatalytic conversion less reactive chemical bonds organic synthesis
