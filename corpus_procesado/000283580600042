questions planets form common earth-like planets can addressed measuring distribution exoplanet masses orbital periods report occurrence rate close-in planets orbital periods less days based precise doppler measurements sun-like stars measured increasing planet occurrence decreasing planet mass m extrapolation power-law mass distribution fitted measurements df/dlogm m- predicts % stars harbor close-in earth-mass planet ranging earth masses theoretical models planet formation predict deficit planets domain earth masses orbital periods less days region parameter space fact well populated implying models need substantial revision
