proximity-induced superconductivity dna
conductivity measurements double-stranded dna molecules deposited combing process across submicron slit rhenium/carbon metallic contacts reveal conduction ohmic room temperature kelvin resistance per molecule less kilohm varies weakly temperature superconducting transition temperature kelvin contacts proximity-induced superconductivity observed results imply dna molecules can conducting millikelvin temperature phase coherence maintained several hundred nanometers
