forster energy transfer optical microcavity 
studying transfer excitation energy dye molecules confined within optical microcavity demonstrate experimentally forster energy transfer influenced local photonic mode density locating donor acceptor molecules well-defined positions allows transfer rate determined function mutual separation cavity length results show forster transfer rate depends linearly donor emission rate hence photonic mode density providing potential control energy transfer modification optical environment
