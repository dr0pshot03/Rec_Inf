balanced inhibition excitation drive spike activity spinal half-centers
many limb movements composed alternating flexions extensions however underlying spinal network mechanisms remain poorly defined show intensity synaptic excitation inhibition limb motoneurons varies phase rather phase rhythmic scratchlike network activity turtle inhibition excitation peak total neuron conductance depolarizing waves scratch episodes furthermore spike activity driven depolarizing synaptic transients rather pacemaker properties findings show balanced excitation inhibition irregular firing fundamental motifs certain spinal network functions
