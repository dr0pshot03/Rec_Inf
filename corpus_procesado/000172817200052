prokaryotic voltage-gated sodium channel 
pore-forming subunits canonical voltage-gated sodium calcium channels encoded four repeated domains six-transmembrane 6tm segments expressed characterized bacterial ion channel nachbac bacillus halodurans encoded one 6tm segment sequence especially pore region similar voltage-gated calcium channels expressed channel activated voltage blocked calcium channel blockers however channel selective sodium identification nachbac functionally expressed bacterial voltage-sensitive ion-selective channel provides insight voltage-dependent activation divalent cation selectivity
