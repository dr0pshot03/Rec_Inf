evolutionary paths underlying flower color variation antirrhinum 
understand evolutionary paths connecting diverse biological forms defined three-dimensional genotypic space separating two flower color morphs antirrhinum hybrid zone morphs showed steep cline specifically genes controlling flower color differences indicating loci selection antirrhinum species diverse floral phenotypes formed u-shaped cloud within genotypic space propose cloud defines evolutionary path allows flower color evolve circumventing less-adaptive regions hybridization morphs located different arms u-shaped path yields low-fitness genotypes accounting observed steep clines hybrid zones
