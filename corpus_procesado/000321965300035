magnetic field observations voyager entered heliosheath depletion region
magnetic fields measured voyager v1 show spacecraft crossed boundary unexpected region five times days similar magnetic field strength b increased across boundary approximate approximate nanotesla b remained near nanotesla least day strong magnetic fields associated unusually low counting rates > mega-electron volt per nuclear particle direction b change significantly across five boundary crossings uniform close spiral magnetic field direction observed throughout heliosheath observations indicate v1 entered region heliosheath heliosheath depletion region rather interstellar medium
