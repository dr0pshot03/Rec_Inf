quantum metropolis sampling
original motivation build quantum computer came feynman imagined machine capable simulating generic quantum mechanical systems-a task believed intractable classical computers machine far-reaching applications simulation many-body quantum physics condensed-matter chemical high-energy systems part feynmans challenge met lloyd showed approximately decompose time evolution operator interacting quantum particles short sequence elementary gates suitable operation quantum computer however left open problem simulate equilibrium static properties quantum systems requires preparation ground gibbs states quantum computer classical systems problem solved ubiquitous metropolis algorithm method basically acquired monopoly simulation interacting particles demonstrate implement quantum version metropolis algorithm algorithm permits sampling directly eigenstates hamiltonian thus evades sign problem present classical simulations small-scale implementation algorithm achievable todays technology
