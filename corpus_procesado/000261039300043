stereocilin-deficient mice reveal origin cochlear waveform distortions 
although cochlea amplifier remarkably sensitive finely tuned detector sounds also produces conspicuous mechanical electrical waveform distortions distortions reflect nonlinear mechanical interactions within cochlea allowing one tone suppress another masking effect contribute speech intelligibility tones can also combine produce sounds frequencies present acoustic stimulus sounds compose otoacoustic emissions extensively used screen hearing newborns cochlear amplification distortion originate outer hair cells one two types sensory receptor cells speculated stem common mechanism show nonlinearity underlying cochlear waveform distortions relies presence stereocilin protein defective recessive form human deafness stereocilin detected association horizontal top connectors- lateral links join adjacent stereocilia within outer hair cells hair bundle links absent stereocilin null mutant mice became progressively deaf onset hearing however cochlear sensitivity frequency tuning almost normal although masking much reduced acoustic electrical waveform distortions completely lacking unique functional situation conclude main source cochlear waveform distortions deflection dependent hair bundle stiffness resulting constraints imposed horizontal top connectors intrinsic nonlinear behaviour mechanoelectrical transducer channel
