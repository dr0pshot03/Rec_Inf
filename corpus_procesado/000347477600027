three-dimensional head-direction coding bat brain
navigation requires sense direction compass mammals thought provided head-direction cells neurons discharge animals head points specific azimuth however remains unclear whether three-dimensional 3d compass exists brain conducted neural recordings bats mammals well-adapted 3d spatial behaviours found head-direction cells tuned azimuth pitch roll conjunctive combinations 3d angles crawling flying bats head-direction cells organized along functional-anatomical gradient presubiculum transitioning 2d 3d representations inverted bats azimuth-tuning neurons shifted degrees suggesting 3d head direction represented azimuth x pitch toroidal coordinates consistent toroidal model pitch-cell tuning unimodal circular continuous within available degrees pitch taken together results demonstrate 3d head-direction mechanism mammals support navigation 3d space
