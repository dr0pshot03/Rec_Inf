crasy: mass electron-correlated rotational alignment spectroscopy
rotational spectra traditionally measured without concurrent means differentiating molecular constituents sample present all-optical multipulse experiment allows correlated measurement rotational mass photoelectron spectra combining fourier transform rotational coherence spectroscopy resonance-enhanced multiphoton ionization demonstrate power method determination ground-state rotational constants fragmentation channels different isotopes natural carbon disulfide sample three reported rotational constants previously inaccessible conventional spectroscopic techniques
