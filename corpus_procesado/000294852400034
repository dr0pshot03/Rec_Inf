small molecule inhibitors reveal niemann-pick c1 essential ebola virus infection
ebola virus ebov highly pathogenic enveloped virus causes outbreaks zoonotic infection africa clinical symptoms manifestations massive production pro-inflammatory cytokines response infection many outbreaks mortality exceeds % unpredictable onset ease transmission rapid progression disease high mortality lack effective vaccine therapy created high level public concern ebov report identification novel benzylpiperazine adamantane diamide-derived compound inhibits ebov infection using mutant cell lines informative derivatives lead compound show target inhibitor endosomal membrane protein niemann-pick c1 npc1 find npc1 essential infection binds virus glycoprotein gp antiviral compounds interfere gp binding npc1 combined results previous studies gp structure function findings support model ebov infection cleavage gp1 subunit endosomal cathepsin proteases removes heavily glycosylated domains expose amino-terminal domain- ligand npc1 regulates membrane fusion gp2 subunit thus npc1 essential ebov entry target antiviral therapy
