nonlocal transport quantum spin hall state
nonlocal transport edge channels holds great promise low-power information processing however edge channels far demonstrated occur quantum hall regime high magnetic fields found mercury telluride quantum wells quantum spin hall regime exhibit nonlocal edge channel transport zero external magnetic field data confirm quantum transport helical edge channels dissipationless contacts lead equilibration counterpropagating spin states edge experimental data agree quantitatively theory quantum spin hall effect edge channel transport paves way new generation spintronic devices low-power information processing
