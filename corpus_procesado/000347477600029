glutathione activates virulence gene expression intracellular pathogen
intracellular pathogens responsible much world-wide morbidity mortality due infectious diseases colonize hosts successfully pathogens must sense environment regulate virulence gene expression appropriately accordingly entry mammalian cells facultative intracellular bacterial pathogen listeria monocytogenes remodels transcriptional program activating master virulence regulator prfa show bacterial host-derived glutathione required activate prfa study genetic selection led identification bacterial mutant glutathione synthase exhibited reduced virulence gene expression attenuated fold mice genome sequencing suppressor mutants arose spontaneously vivo revealed single nucleotide change prfa locks protein active conformation prfa* completely bypassed requirement glutathione infection biochemical genetic studies support model glutathione-dependent prfa activation mediated allosteric binding glutathione prfa whereas glutathione low-molecular-weight thiols important roles redox homeostasis forms life demonstrate glutathione represents critical signalling molecule activates virulence intracellular pathogen
