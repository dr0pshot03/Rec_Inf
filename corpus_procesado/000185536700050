reprogramming control allosteric signaling switch modular recombination 
many eukaryotic signaling proteins composed simple modular binding domains yet can display sophisticated behaviors allosteric gating multi-input signal integration properties essential complex cellular circuits understand behavior can emerge combinations simple domains engineered variants actin regulatory protein n-wasp neuronal wiskott-aldrich syndrome protein "output" domain n-wasp recombined heterologous autoinhibitory "input" domains synthetic switch proteins created diverse gating behaviors response nonphysiological inputs thus type modular framework can facilitate evolution engineering cellular signaling circuits
