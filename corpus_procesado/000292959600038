atmospheric carbon injection linked end-triassic mass extinction 
end-triassic mass extinction similar million years ago marked terrestrial ecosystem turnover similar % loss marine biodiversity attributed intensified volcanic activity break-up pangaea present compound-specific carbon-isotope data long-chain n-alkanes derived waxes land plants showing similar per mil negative excursion coincident extinction interval data indicate strong carbon depletion end-triassic atmosphere within years magnitude rate carbon-cycle disruption can explained injection least similar x gigatons isotopically depleted carbon methane atmosphere concurrent vegetation changes reflect strong warming enhanced hydrological cycle hence end-triassic events robustly linked methane-derived massive carbon release associated climate change
