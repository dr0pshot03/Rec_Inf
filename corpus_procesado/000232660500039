tunable gold catalysts selective hydrocarbon oxidation mild conditions
oxidation important method synthesis chemical intermediates manufacture high-tonnage commodities high-value fine chemicals agrochemicals pharmaceuticals: oxidations often inefficient introduction catalytic systems using oxygen air preferred green processing gold catalysis now showing potential selective redox processes- particularly alcohol oxidation- direct synthesis hydrogen peroxide however major challenge persists synthesis epoxide direct electrophilic addition oxygen alkene although ethene epoxidized efficiently using molecular oxygen silver catalysts large-scale industrial process unique higher alkenes can effectively epoxidized using hydrogen peroxide- hydroperoxides stoichiometric oxygen donors show nanocrystalline gold catalysts can provide tunable active catalysts oxidation alkenes using air exceptionally high selectivity partial oxidation products similar % significant conversions finding significantly extends discovery haruta nanocrystalline gold can epoxidize alkenes hydrogen used activate molecular oxygen case sacrificial reductant needed anticipate finding will initiate attempts understand fully mechanism oxygen activation gold surfaces might lead commercial exploitation high redox activity gold nanocrystals
