force microscopy light-atom probes
charge distribution atoms closed electron shells spherically symmetric whereas atoms partially filled shells can form covalent bonds pointed lobes increased charge density covalent bonding bulk can also affect surface atoms leading four tiny humps spaced less picometers charge density adatoms tungsten surface imaged charge distributions means atomic force microscopy use light-atom probe graphite atom directly measured high-order force derivatives interaction tungsten tip process revealed features lateral distance picometers
