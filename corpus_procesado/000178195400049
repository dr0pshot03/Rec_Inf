active genes tri-methylated k4 histone h3 
lysine methylation histones vivo occurs three states: mono- di tri-methyl histone h3 found dimethylated lysine k4 active euchromatic regions silent heterochromatic sites show saccharomyces cerevisiae set1 protein can catalyse di tri methylation k4 stimulate activity many genes using antibodies discriminate di tri methylated state k4 show di methylation occurs inactive active euchromatic genes whereas tri methylation present exclusively active genes therefore presence trimethylated k4 defines active state gene expression findings establish concept methyl status determinant gene activity thus extend considerably complexity histone modifications
