fusogen eff controls sculpting mechanosensory dendrites 
mechanisms controlling formation maintenance neuronal trees poorly understood examined dynamic development two arborized mechanoreceptor neurons pvds required reception strong mechanical stimuli caenorhabditis elegans pvds elaborated dendritic trees comprising structural units call menorahs studied number structure function menorahs maintained eff- essential protein mediating cell fusion acted autonomously pvds trim developing menorahs eff mutants displayed hyperbranched disorganized menorahs overexpression eff pvd reduced branching neuronal pruning appeared involve eff--dependent branch retraction neurite-neurite autofusion thus eff activities may act quality control mechanism sculpting dendritic trees
