pairing without superfluidity: ground state imbalanced fermi mixture 
used radio-frequency spectroscopy study pairing normal superfluid phases strongly interacting fermi gas imbalanced spin populations high spin imbalances system become superfluid even zero temperature normal phase full pairing minority atoms observed hence mismatched fermi surfaces prevent pairing can quench superfluid state thus realizing system fermion pairs condense even lowest temperature
