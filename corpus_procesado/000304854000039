clonally related visual cortical neurons show similar stimulus feature selectivity
fundamental feature mammalian neocortex columnar organization visual cortex functional columns consisting neurons similar orientation preferences characterized extensively- columns constructed development remains unclear radial unit hypothesis posits ontogenetic columns formed clonally related neurons migrating along radial glial fibre corticogenesis provide basis functional columns adult neocortex however direct correspondence ontogenetic functional columns demonstrated show despite lack discernible orientation map mouse visual cortex sister neurons radial clone exhibit similar orientation preferences using retroviral vector encoding green fluorescent protein label radial clones excitatory neurons vivo two-photon calcium imaging measure neuronal response properties found sister neurons preferred similar orientations whereas nearby non-sister neurons showed relationship interestingly disruption gap junction coupling viral expression dominant-negative mutant cx26 also known gjb2 daily administration gap junction blocker carbenoxolone first postnatal week greatly diminished functional similarity sister neurons suggesting maturation ontogenetic functional columns requires intercellular communication gap junctions together recent finding preferential excitatory connections among sister neurons results support radial unit hypothesis unify ontogenetic functional columns visual cortex
