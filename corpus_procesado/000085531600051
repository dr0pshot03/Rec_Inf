translocation c elegans ced nuclear membranes programmed cell death
caenorhabditis elegans bcl--like protein ced prevents programmed cell death antagonizing apaf--like cell-death activator ced- endogenous ced ced proteins localized mitochondria wild-type embryos cells survive contrast embryos cells induced die ced assumed perinuclear localization ced translocation induced cell-death activator egl blocked gain-of-function mutation ced dependent ced function suggesting ced translocation precedes caspase activation execution phase programmed cell death thus change subcellular localization ced may drive programmed cell death
