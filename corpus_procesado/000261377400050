dynamic analyses drosophila gastrulation provide insights collective cell migration
concerted movement cells different germ layers contributes morphogenesis early embryonic development using optimized imaging approach quantitative methods analyzed trajectories hundreds ectodermal cells internalized mesodermal cells within drosophila embryos hours gastrulation found high level cellular organization mesoderm cell movements correlating ectoderm movements migration mesoderm population underwent two ordered waves cell division synchronous cell intercalation cells leading edge stably maintained position fibroblast growth factor fgf signaling guides mesodermal cell migration however found directed dorsal migration fgf receptor mutant suggests additional signals involved thus decomposing complex cellular movements can provide detailed insights collective cell migration
