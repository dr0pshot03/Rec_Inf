functional hierarchy reversibility within murine spermatogenic stem cell compartment
stem cells support tissue maintenance balancing self-renewal differentiation mice believed homogeneous stem cell population single spermatogonia supports spermatogenesis differentiation accompanied formation connected cells cysts increasing length linear nonreversible evaluated model use lineage analysis live imaging found putative stem cell population homogeneous instead stem cell pool supports steady-state spermatogenesis contained within subpopulation single spermatogonia also found cysts committed differentiation appear recover stem cell potential fragmentation fate individual spermatogonial populations markedly altered regeneration damage thus multiple reversible paths stem cells differentiation may also occur systems
