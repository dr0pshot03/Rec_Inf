targeted retrieval analysis five neandertal mtdna genomes 
analysis neandertal dna holds great potential investigating population history group hominins progress limited due rarity samples damaged state dna present method targeted ancient dna sequence retrieval greatly reduces sample destruction sequencing demands use method reconstruct complete mitochondrial dna mtdna genomes five neandertals across geographic range find mtdna genetic diversity neandertals lived years ago approximately one-third contemporary modern humans together analyses mtdna protein evolution data suggest long-term effective population size neandertals smaller modern humans extant great apes
