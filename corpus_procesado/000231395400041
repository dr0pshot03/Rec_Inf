theoretical study geometric phase effects hydrogen-exchange reaction
crossing two electronic potential surfaces conical intersection result geometric phase effects even molecular processes confined lower surface however recent quantum simulations hydrogen exchange reaction h+h--> h-+h predicted cancellation effects product distributions integrated scattering angles used simple topological argument extract reaction paths different senses nuclear wave function encircles conical intersection hydrogen-exchange reaction senses correspond paths cross one two transition states two sets paths scatter products different regions space causes cancellation geometric phase effects analysis generalize direct reactions
