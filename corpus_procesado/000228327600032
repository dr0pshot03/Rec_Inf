dna damage response candidate anti-cancer barrier early human tumorigenesis
evolution cancer incipient tumour experiences oncogenic stress evokes counter response eliminate hazardous cells however nature stress remains elusive inducible anti-cancer barrier elicits growth arrest cell death show clinical specimens different stages human tumours urinary bladder breast lung colon early precursor lesions normal tissues commonly express markers activated dna damage response include phosphorylated kinases atm chk2 phosphorylated histone h2ax p53 similar checkpoint responses induced cultured cells upon expression different oncogenes deregulate dna replication together genetic analyses including genome-wide assessment allelic imbalances data indicate early tumorigenesis genomic instability malignant conversion human cells activate atr/atm regulated dna damage response network delays prevents cancer mutations compromising checkpoint including defects atm chk2 p53 pathway might allow cell proliferation survival increased genomic instability tumour progression
