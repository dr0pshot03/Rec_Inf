aggregation-based crystal growth microstructure development natural iron oxyhydroxide biomineralization products 
crystals generally considered grow attachment ions inorganic surfaces organic templates high-resolution transmission electron microscopy biomineralization products iron-oxidizing bacteria revealed alternative coarsening mechanism adjacent -nanometer particles aggregate rotate structures adopt parallel orientations three dimensions crystal growth accomplished eliminating water molecules interfaces forming iron-oxygen bonds self-assembly occurs multiple sites leading coarser polycrystalline material point defects surface-adsorbed impurities dislocations slabs structurally distinct material created consequence growth mechanism can dramatically impact subsequent reactivity
