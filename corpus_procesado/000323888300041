induction intestinal stem cells r-spondin slit2 augments chemoradioprotection 
cancer research rightly successfully focused prevention early detection identification specific molecular targets distinguish malignant cells neighbouring benign cells1 however reducing lethal tissue injury caused intensive chemoradiotherapy treatment late-stage metastatic cancers remains key clinical challenge tested whether induction adult stem cells repair chemoradiation-induced tissue injury prolong overall survival mice found intestinal stem cells iscs2 expressed slit2 single-span transmembrane cell-surface receptor roundabout robo134 partial genetic deletion robo1 decreased isc numbers caused villus hypotrophy whereas slit2 transgene increased isc numbers triggered villus hypertrophy lethal dosages chemoradiation administering short pulse r-spondin rspo1; wnt agonist5- plus slit2 reduced isc loss mitigated gut impairment protected animals death without concomitantly decreasing tumour sensitivity chemotherapy therefore rspo1 slit2 may act therapeutic adjuvants enhance host tolerance aggressive chemoradiotherapy eradicating metastatic cancers
