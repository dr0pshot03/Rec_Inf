electric fields due synaptic currents sharpen excitatory transmission 
synaptic response waveform determines signal integration properties brain depends spatiotemporal profile neurotransmitter synaptic cleft show electrophoretic interactions ampa receptor mediated excitatory currents negatively charged glutamate molecules accelerate clearance glutamate synaptic cleft speeding synaptic responses phenomenon reversed upon depolarization diminished intracleft electric fields weakened decrease ampa receptor density contrast kinetics receptor mediated currents evoked direct application glutamate voltage independent synaptic currents mediated electrically neutral neurotransmitter gaba voltage dependent temporal tuning excitatory synaptic responses may thus contribute signal integration neural circuits
