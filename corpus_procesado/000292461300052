structure-based design non-natural amino-acid inhibitors amyloid fibril formation
many globular natively disordered proteins can convert amyloid fibrils fibrils associated numerous pathologies well normal cellular functions frequently form protein denaturation inhibitors pathological amyloid fibril formation useful development therapeutics provided inhibitors specific enough avoid interfering normal processes show computer-aided structure-based design can yield highly specific peptide inhibitors amyloid formation using known atomic structures segments amyloid fibrils templates designed characterized all-d-amino-acid inhibitor fibril formation tau protein associated alzheimers disease non-natural l-amino-acid inhibitor amyloid fibril enhances sexual transmission human immunodeficiency virus results indicate peptides structure-based designs can disrupt fibril formation full-length proteins including tau protein lack fully ordered native structures inhibiting peptides designed structures dual-beta-sheet steric zippers successful inhibition amyloid fibril formation strengthens hypothesis amyloid spines contain steric zippers
