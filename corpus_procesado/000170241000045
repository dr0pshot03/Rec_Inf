myotonic dystrophy type caused cctg expansion intron znf9
myotonic dystrophy dm common form muscular dystrophy adults can caused mutation either chromosome 19q13 dm1 3q21 dm2/promm dm1 caused ctg expansion untranslated region dystrophia myotonica-protein kinase gene dmpk several mechanisms invoked explain mutation alter protein-coding portion gene causes specific constellation clinical features characteristic dm now report dm2 caused cctg expansion mean similar repeats located intron zinc finger protein znf9 gene parallels mutations indicate microsatellite expansions rna can pathogenic cause multisystemic features dm1 dm2
