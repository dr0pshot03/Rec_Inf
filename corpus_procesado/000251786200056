cdc48/p97 promotes reformation nucleus extracting kinase aurora b chromatin 
division metazoan cells nucleus disassembles allow chromosome segregation reforms daughter cell reformation nucleus involves chromatin decondensation assembly double membrane nuclear envelope around chromatin however regulation process still poorly understood vitro nucleus formation requires p97 ref hexameric atpase implicated membrane fusion ubiquitin dependent processes however role relevance p97 nucleus formation remained controversial show p97 stimulates nucleus reformation inactivating chromatin associated kinase aurora b mitosis aurora b inhibits nucleus reformation preventing chromosome decondensation formation nuclear envelope membrane exit mitosis p97 binds aurora b ubiquitylation extracts chromatin leads inactivation aurora b chromatin thus allowing chromatin decondensation nuclear envelope formation data reveal essential pathway regulates reformation nucleus mitosis defines ubiquitin dependent protein extraction common mechanism cdc48/p97 activity also nucleus formation
