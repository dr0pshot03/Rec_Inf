faking giants: evolution high prey clearance rates jellyfishes
jellyfishes functionally replaced several overexploited commercial stocks planktivorous fishes paradoxical use primitive prey capture mechanism requiring direct contact prey whereas fishes use efficient visual detection compiled published data show spite primitive life-style jellyfishes exhibit similar instantaneous prey clearance respiration rates fish competitors similar potential growth reproduction achieve production evolved large water-laden bodies increase prey contact rates although larger bodies less efficient swimming optimization analysis reveals large collectors advantageous move water sufficiently slowly
