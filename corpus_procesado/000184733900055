photonic structures biology
millions years began manipulate flow light using synthetic structures biological systems using nanometre-scale architectures produce striking optical effects astonishing variety natural photonic structures exists: species brittlestar uses photonic elements composed calcite collect light morphobutterflies use multiple layers cuticle air produce striking blue colour insects use arrays elements known nipple arrays reduce reflectivity compound eyes natural photonic structures providing inspiration technological applications
