high-performance solid acid fuel cells humidity stabilization 
although hold promise clean energy state-of-the-art fuel cells based polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells inoperable 100degreesc require cumbersome humidification systems suffer fuel permeation difficulties arise hydrated nature electrolyte contrast "solid acids" exhibit anhydrous proton transport high-temperature stability demonstrate continuous stable power generation h-/o- direct methanol fuel cells operated similar to250degreesc using humidity-stabilized solid acid csh2po4 electrolyte
