ste5 scaffold allosterically modulates signaling output yeast mating pathway 
scaffold proteins organize signaling proteins pathways often viewed passive assembly platforms found ste5 scaffold active role yeast mating pathway: fragment ste5 allosterically activated autophosphorylation mitogen-activated protein kinase fus3 resulting form fus3 partially active-it phosphorylated one two key residues activation loop unexpectedly systems level autoactivated fus3 appears negative regulatory rote promoting ste5 phosphorylation decrease pathway transcriptional output thus scaffolds direct basic pathway connectivity can precisely tune quantitative pathway input-output properties
