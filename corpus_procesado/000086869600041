promoter-selective properties tbp-related factor trf1
tata-binding protein tbp-related factor trf1 expressed tissue-restricted fashion drosophila embryogenesis may serve promoter-specific recognition factor can replace tbp regulating transcription however bona fide target promoters preferentially respond trf1 remained elusive polytene chromosome staining chromatin immunoprecipitation direct messenger rna analysis transient cotransfection assays identified drosophila gene tudor containing trf1-responsive promoter reconstituted vitro transcription reactions deoxyribonuclease footprinting assays confirmed ability trf1 bind preferentially direct transcription tudor gene alternate promoter thug metazoans appear evolved gene-selective tissue-specific components core transcription machinery regulate gene expression
