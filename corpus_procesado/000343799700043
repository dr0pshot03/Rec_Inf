momentum sharing imbalanced fermi systems 
atomic nucleus composed two different kinds fermions: protons neutrons protons neutrons interact pauli exclusion principle force majority fermions usually neutrons higher average momentum high-energy electron-scattering measurements using c- al- fe- pb targets show even heavy neutron-rich nuclei short-range interactions fermions form correlated high-momentum neutron-proton pairs thus neutron-rich nuclei protons greater probability neutrons momentum greater fermi momentum finding implications ranging nuclear few-body systems neutron stars may also observable experimentally two-spin-state ultracold atomic gas systems
