bright infrared emission electrically induced excitons carbon nanotubes 
used high local electric fields junction suspended supported parts single carbon nanotube molecule produce unusually bright infrared emission unipolar operation carriers accelerated band-bending suspension interface created excitons radiatively recombined excitation mechanism similar times efficient recombination independently injected electrons holes results weak electron-phonon scattering strong electron-hole binding caused one-dimensional confinement ensuing high excitation density allows us observe emission higher excited states seen photoexcitation excitation mechanism states analyzed
