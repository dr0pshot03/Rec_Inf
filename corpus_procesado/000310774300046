regulatory b cells control t-cell autoimmunity il--dependent cognate interactions 
b cells regulate immune responses producing antigen-specific antibodies1 however specific b-cell subsets can also negatively regulate t-cell immune responses termed regulatory b cells2- human mouse regulatory b cells b10 cells ability express inhibitory cytokine interleukin- il- identified2- although rare b10 cells potent negative regulators antigen-specific inflammation t-cell-dependent autoimmune diseases mice5- b10-cell il- production regulation antigen-specific immune responses controlled vivo without inducing systemic immunosuppression unknown using mouse model multiple sclerosis show b10-cell maturation functional il--secreting effector cells inhibit vivo autoimmune disease requires il- cd40-dependent cognate interactions t cells moreover ex vivo provision cd40 il- receptor signals can drive b10-cell development expansion four-million-fold generate b10 effector cells producing il- markedly inhibit disease symptoms transferred mice established autoimmune disease ex vivo expansion reinfusion autologous b10 cells may provide novel effective vivo treatment severe autoimmune diseases resistant current therapies
