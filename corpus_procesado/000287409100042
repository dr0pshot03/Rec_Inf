tbx6-dependent sox2 regulation determines neural mesodermal fate axial stem cells 
classical view neural plate development held arises ectoderm separation mesodermal endodermal lineages however recent cell-lineage-tracing experiments indicate caudal neural plate paraxial mesoderm generated common bipotential axial stem cells originating caudal lateral epiblast12 tbx6 null mutant mouse embryos produce ectopic neural tubes expense paraxial mesoderm3 must provide clue regulatory mechanism underlying neural versus mesodermal fate choice demonstrate tbx6-dependent regulation sox2 determines fate axial stem cells wild-type embryos enhancer n1 neural primordial gene sox2 activated caudal lateral epiblast cells staying superficial layer sustain n1 activity activate sox2 expression neural plate4- contrast cells destined become mesoderm activate tbx6 turn enhancer n1 migrating paraxial mesoderm compartment tbx6 mutant embryos however enhancer n1 activity persists paraxial mesoderm compartment eliciting ectopic sox2 activation transforming paraxial mesoderm neural tubes enhancer-n1-specific deletion mutation introduced tbx6 mutant embryos prevented sox2 activation mesodermal compartment subsequent development ectopic neural tubes indicating tbx6 regulates sox2 via enhancer n1 tbx6-dependent repression wnt3a paraxial mesodermal compartment implicated regulatory process paraxial mesoderm-specific misexpression sox2 transgene wild-type embryos resulted ectopic neural tube development thus tbx6 represses sox2 inactivating enhancer n1 inhibit neural development essential step specification paraxial mesoderm axial stem cells
