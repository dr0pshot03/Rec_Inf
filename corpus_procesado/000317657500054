resilience recovery overexploited marine populations
recovery overexploited marine populations slow remain target biomass levels key question whether due insufficient reductions harvest rates erosion population resilience using global meta-analysis overfished stocks find resilience stocks subjected moderate levels overfishing enhanced compromised offering possibility swift recovery however prolonged intense overexploitation especially collapsed stocks delays rebuilding also substantially increases uncertainty recovery times despite predictable influences fishing life history timely decisive reductions harvest rates mitigate uncertainty instead current harvest low biomass levels render recovery improbable majority worlds depleted stocks
