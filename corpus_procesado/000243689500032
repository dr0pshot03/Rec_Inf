unexpected cooling effect saturns upper atmosphere
upper atmospheres four solar system giant planets exhibit high temperatures explained absorption sunlight case saturn temperatures predicted models solar heating k compared temperatures similar k observed independently polar regions degrees latitude unexplained energy crisis represents major gap understanding planets atmospheres important candidate source missing energy magnetosphere- injects energy mostly polar regions planet polar energy input believed sufficient explain observed temperatures provided efficiently redistributed globally winds process well understood show using numerical model net effect winds driven polar energy inputs heat cool low-latitude thermosphere surprising result allows us rule known polar energy inputs solution energy crisis saturn either unknown large source polar energy probably process heats low latitudes directly
