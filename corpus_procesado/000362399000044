identification carbohydrate anomers using ion mobility-mass spectrometry
carbohydrates ubiquitous biological polymers important broad range biological processes- however owing branched structures presence stereogenic centres glycosidic linkage monomers carbohydrates harder characterize peptides oligonucleotides methods nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy can used characterize glycosidic linkages technique requires milligram amounts material detect small amounts coexisting isomers mass spectrometry hand can provide information carbohydrate composition connectivity even small amounts sample used distinguish stereoisomers demonstrate ion mobility-mass spectrometry-a method separates molecules according mass charge size shape-can unambiguously identify carbohydrate linkage-isomers stereoisomers analysed six synthetic carbohydrate isomers differ composition connectivity configuration data show coexisting carbohydrate isomers can identified relative concentrations minor isomer low per cent can detected addition analysis rapid requires derivatization small amounts sample results indicate ion-mobility-mass spectrometry effective tool analysis complex carbohydrates method impact field carbohydrate synthesis similar advent high-performance liquid chromatography field peptide assembly late 1970s
