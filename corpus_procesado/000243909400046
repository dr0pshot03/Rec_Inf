two-amino acid change hemagglutinin influenza virus abolishes transmission 
influenza pandemic catastrophic series virus outbreaks spread across globe show modest change influenza hemagglutinin receptor binding site alters transmissibility pandemic virus two amino acid mutations cause switch receptor binding preference human alpha- avian alpha- sialic acid resulted virus incapable respiratory droplet transmission ferrets maintained lethality replication efficiency upper respiratory tract furthermore poor transmission virus dual alpha- alpha- specificity suggests predominant human alpha- sialic acid binding preference essential optimal transmission pandemic virus findings confirm essential role hemagglutinin receptor specificity transmission influenza viruses among mammals
