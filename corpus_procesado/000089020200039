automatic design manufacture robotic lifeforms 
biological life control means reproduction generally involves complex autocatalysing chemical reactions autonomy design manufacture yet realized artificially robots still laboriously designed constructed teams human engineers usually considerable expense robots available costs must absorbed mass production justified toys weapons industrial systems automatic teller machines report results combined computational experimental approach simple electromechanical systems evolved simulations basic building blocks bars actuators artificial neurons fittest machines defined locomotive ability fabricated robotically using rapid manufacturing technology thus achieve autonomy design construction using evolution limited universe physical simulation coupled automatic fabrication
