genome-wide detection single-nucleotide copy-number variations single human cell
kindred cells can different genomes dynamic changes dna single-cell sequencing needed characterize genomic differences hindered whole-genome amplification bias resulting low genome coverage report new amplification method-multiple annealing looping-based amplification cycles malbac-that offers high uniformity across genome sequencing malbac-amplified dna achieves % genome coverage > 1x single human cell 25x mean sequencing depth detected digitized copy-number variations cnvs single cancer cell sequencing three kindred cells able identify individual single-nucleotide variations snvs false positives detected directly measured genome-wide mutation rate cancer cell line found purine-pyrimidine exchanges occurred unusually frequently among newly acquired snvs
