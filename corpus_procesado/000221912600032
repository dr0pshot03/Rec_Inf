subtractive proteomic mapping endothelial surface lung solid tumours tissue-specific therapy
molecular complexity tissues inaccessibility cells within tissue limit discovery key targets tissue-specific delivery therapeutic imaging agents vivo describe hypothesis-driven systems biology approach identifying small subset proteins induced tissue blood interface inherently accessible antibodies injected intravenously use subcellular fractionation subtractive proteomics bioinformatics identify endothelial cell surface proteins exhibiting restricted tissue distribution apparent tissue modulation expression profiling gamma-scintigraphic imaging antibodies establishes two proteins aminopeptidase p annexin a1 selective vivo targets antibodies lungs solid tumours respectively radio-immunotherapy annexin a1 destroys tumours increases animal survival analytical strategy can map tissue disease-specific expression endothelial cell surface proteins uncover novel accessible targets useful imaging therapy
