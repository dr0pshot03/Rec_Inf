clarifying dominant sources mechanisms cirrus cloud formation 
formation cirrus clouds depends availability ice nuclei begin condensation atmospheric water vapor although known small fraction atmospheric aerosols efficient ice nuclei critical ingredients make aerosols effective established determined situ composition residual particles within cirrus crystals ice sublimated results demonstrate mineral dust metallic particles dominant source residual particles whereas sulfate organic particles underrepresented elemental carbon biological materials essentially absent composition analysis combined relative humidity measurements suggests heterogeneous freezing dominant formation mechanism clouds
