iapetus: unique surface properties global color dichotomy cassini imaging
since saturns moon iapetus observed repeatedly imaging science subsystem cassini spacecraft images show numerous impact craters resolution limit similar meters per pixel small bright craters within dark hemisphere indicate dark blanket thickness order meters less dark equator-facing bright poleward-facing crater walls suggest temperature-driven water-ice sublimation process responsible local albedo patterns imaging data also reveal global color dichotomy wherein dark bright materials leading side substantially redder color respective trailing-side materials global pattern indicates exogenic origin redder leading-side parts suggests global color dichotomy initiated thermal formation global albedo dichotomy
