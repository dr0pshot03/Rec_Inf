direct measurement critical casimir forces
fluctuating fields confined two surfaces long range forces arise famous example quantum electrodynamical casimir force results zero point vacuum fluctuations confined two conducting metal plates thermodynamic analogue critical casimir force: acts surfaces immersed binary liquid mixture close critical point arises confinement concentration fluctuations within thin film fluid separating surfaces far experimental evidence existence effect indirect- report direct measurement critical casimir force single colloidal sphere flat silica surface immersed mixture water lutidine near critical point use total internal reflection microscopy determine situ forces sphere surface femtonewton resolution depending whether adsorption preferences sphere surface water lutidine identical opposite measure attractive repulsive forces respectively agree quantitatively theoretical predictions exhibit exquisite dependence temperature system expect features critical casimir forces may result novel uses colloids model systems
