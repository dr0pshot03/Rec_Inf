regulation spontaneous intestinal tumorigenesis adaptor protein myd88
inflammation increasingly recognized important component tumorigenesis although mechanisms pathways involved well understood tumor development regulated products several modifier genes instructions tumor-specific expression currently unknown show signaling adaptor protein myd88 critical role spontaneous tumor development mice heterozygous mutation adenomatous polyposis coli apc gene found myd88-dependent signaling controls expression several key modifier genes intestinal tumorigenesis critical role spontaneous carcinogen-induced tumor development study thus reveals important role innate immune signaling pathway intestinal tumorigenesis
