binary switches modification cassettes histone biology beyond
immense number post-translational modifications histone proteins described additional sites modification still uncovered whereas many direct indirect connections certain histone modifications distinct biological phenomena now established concepts comprehending extreme density variety covalent modifications lacking formally introduce localized binary switches modification cassettes new concepts histone biology elucidating mechanisms might govern biological readout distinct modification patterns specifically hypotheses provide missing models dynamic readout stable histone modifications offer explanations several long-standing questions embedded literature ideas might also apply non-histone proteins open direct experimental examination
