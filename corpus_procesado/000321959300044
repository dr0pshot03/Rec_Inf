developmental control melanocortin- receptor mrap2 proteins zebrafish 
melanocortin- receptor mc4r essential control energy homeostasis vertebrates mc4r interacts melanocortin receptor accessory protein mrap2 vitro functions vivo unknown found mrap2a larval form stimulates growth zebrafish specifically blocking action mc4r cell culture protein binds mc4r reduces ability receptor bind ligand alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone alpha-msh paralog mrap2b expressed later development also binds mc4r increases ligand sensitivity thus mrap2 proteins allow developmental control mc4r activity mrap2a blocking function stimulating growth larval development whereas mrap2b enhances responsiveness alpha-msh zebrafish begins feeding thus increasing capacity regulated feeding growth
