semi-synthetic organism expanded genetic alphabet
organisms defined information encoded genomes since origin life information encoded using two-base-pair genetic alphabet a-t g-c vitro alphabet expanded include several unnatural base pairs ubps- developed class ubps formed nucleotides bearing hydrophobic nucleobases exemplified pair formed d5sics dnam d5sics-dnam efficiently pcr-amplified transcribed vitro whose unique mechanism replication characterized however expansion organisms genetic alphabet presents new unprecedented challenges: unnatural nucleoside triphosphates must available inside cell endogenous polymerases must able use unnatural triphosphates faithfully replicate dna containing ubp within complex cellular milieu finally ubp must stable presence pathways maintain integrity dna show exogenously expressed algal nucleotide triphosphate transporter efficiently imports triphosphates d5sics dnam d5sicstp dnamtp escherichia coli endogenous replication machinery uses accurately replicate plasmid containing d5sics-dnam neither presence unnatural triphosphates replication ubp introduces notable growth burden lastly find ubp efficiently excised dna repair pathways thus resulting bacterium first organism propagate stably expanded genetic alphabet
