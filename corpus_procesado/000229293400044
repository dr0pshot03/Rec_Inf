clonal dominance hematopoietic stem cells triggered retroviral gene marking
gene marking replication-defective retroviral vectors used years track vivo fate cell clones demonstrate retroviral integrations may trigger nonmalignant clonal expansion murine long-term hematopoiesis insertions recovered clones dominating serially transplanted recipients affected loci established potential role self-renewal survival hematopoietic stem cells transcriptional dysregulation occurred insertion sites analyzed findings major implications diagnostic gene marking discovery genes regulating stem cell turnover
