single-cell rna-seq reveals dynamic random monoallelic gene expression mammalian cells
expression alleles generally observed analyses diploid cell populations studies addressing allelic expression patterns genome-wide single cells lacking present global analyses allelic expression across individual cells mouse preimplantation embryos mixed background cast/eij x c57bl/6j discovered abundant % monoallelic expression autosomal genes expression two alleles occurs independently monoallelic expression appeared random dynamic considerable variation among closely related embryonic cells similar patterns monoallelic expression observed mature cells allelic expression analysis also demonstrates de novo inactivation paternal x chromosome conclude independent stochastic allelic transcription generates abundant random monoallelic expression mammalian cell
