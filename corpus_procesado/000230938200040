supernova olivine cometary dust 
interplanetary dust particle contains submicrometer crystalline silicate aggregate probable supernova origin grain pronounced enrichment o-/o- times solar value depletions o-/o- one-third solar si-/si- < times solar indicative formation type supernova aggregate contains olivine forsterite grains < nanometers size microstructures consistent minimal thermal alteration unusually iron-rich olivine grain formed equilibrium condensation cooling supernova ejecta several different nucleosynthetic zones mixed proper proportions supernova grain also partially encased nitrogen--rich organic matter likely formed presolar cold molecular cloud
