deep-sea temperature ice volume changes across pliocene-pleistocene climate transitions 
earth undergone profound changes since late pliocene led development [similar million years ago ma] intensification similar ma large-scale northern hemisphere ice sheets recorded transitions benthic foraminiferal oxygen isotope delta18ob record present orbitally resolved record deep ocean temperature derived benthic foraminiferal magnesium/calcium ratios north atlantic shows temperature variations substantial portion global delta18ob signal record shows two distinct cooling events associated late pliocene lpt ma mid-pleistocene mpt ma climate transitions whereas lpt increase ice volume attributed directly global cooling shift -year cycles mpt likely response additional change ice-sheet dynamics
