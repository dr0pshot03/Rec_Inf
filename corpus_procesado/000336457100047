bacterial phylogeny structures soil resistomes across habitats 
ancient diverse antibiotic resistance genes args previously identified soil- including genes identical human pathogens despite apparent overlap soil clinical resistomes- factors influencing arg composition soil movement genomes habitats remain largely unknown general metagenome functions often correlate underlying structure bacterial communities- however args proposed highly mobile prompting speculation resistomes may correlate phylogenetic signatures ecological divisions investigate relationships performed functional metagenomic selections resistance antibiotics agricultural grassland soils args discovered mostly new represent major resistance mechanisms demonstrate distinct soil types harbour distinct resistomes addition nitrogen fertilizer strongly influenced soil arg content resistome composition also correlated microbial phylogenetic taxonomic structure across within soil types consistent strong correlation mobility elements genes responsible horizontal gene transfer bacteria transposases integrases syntenic args rare soil comparison sequenced pathogens suggesting args may transfer soil bacteria readily observed human pathogens together results indicate bacterial community composition primary determinant soil arg content challenging previous hypotheses horizontal gene transfer effectively decouples resistomes phylogeny
