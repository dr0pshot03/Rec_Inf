l23 protein functions chaperone docking site ribosome
translation first encounter nascent polypeptides ribosome-associated chaperones assist folding process-a principle seems conserved evolution-in escherichia coli ribosome-bound trigger factor chaperones folding cytosolic proteins interacting nascent polypeptides identify ribosome-binding motif amino-terminal domain trigger factor also show formation crosslinked products trigger factor two adjacent ribosomal proteins l23 l29 located exit peptide tunnel ribosome l23 essential growth e coli association trigger factor ribosome whereas l29 dispensable processes mutation exposed glutamate l23 prevents trigger factor interacting ribosomes nascent chains causes protein aggregation conditional lethality cells lack protein repair function dnak chaperone purified l23 also interacts specifically trigger factor vitro conclude essential l23 provides chaperone docking site ribosomes directly links protein biosynthesis chaperone-assisted protein folding
