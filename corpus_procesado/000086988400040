high-affinity iron permease essential candida albicans virulence
microbial pathogens must compete iron-withholding defense systems host acquire essential nutrient two high-affinity iron permease genes caftr1 caftr2 isolated caftr1 expression induced iron-limited conditions repressed iron supply sufficient whereas expression caftr2 regulated reversed manner mutants lacking caftr1 caftr2 exhibited severe growth defect iron-deficient medium unable establish systemic infection mice thus caftr1-mediated iron-uptake mechanism constitutes virulence factor candida albicans may target development anti-candida therapies
