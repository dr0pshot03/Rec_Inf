humanization yeast produce complex terminally sialylated glycoproteins
yeast widely used recombinant protein expression system expanded utility engineering yeast pichia pastoris secrete human glycoproteins fully complex terminally sialylated n-glycans knockout four genes eliminate yeast-specific glycosylation introduced heterologous genes allowing us replicate sequential steps human glycosylation reported cell lines produce complex glycoproteins greater % terminal sialylation finally demonstrate utility yeast strains functional recombinant erythropoietin produced
