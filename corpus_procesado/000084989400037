role southern ocean uptake storage anthropogenic carbon dioxide 
ocean-climate model shows high fluxes anthropogenic carbon dioxide southern ocean low storage anthropogenic carbon agrees observation-based estimates ocean storage anthropogenic carbon dioxide low simulated storage indicates subordinate role deep convection present-day southern ocean primary mechanism transporting anthropogenic carbon southern ocean isopycnal transport results imply global climate change reduces density surface waters southern ocean isopycnal surfaces now outcrop may become isolated atmosphere tending diminish southern ocean carbon uptake
