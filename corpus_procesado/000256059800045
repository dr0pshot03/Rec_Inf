differential rescue light food-entrainable circadian rhythms
food plentiful circadian rhythms animals powerfully entrained light dark cycle however animals access food normal sleep cycle will shift circadian rhythms match food availability studied basis entrainment circadian rhythms food light mice targeted disruption clock gene bmal1 lack circadian rhythmicity injection viral vector containing bmal1 gene suprachiasmatic nuclei hypothalamus restored light entrainable food entrainable circadian rhythms contrast restoration bmal1 gene dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus restored ability animals entrain food light results demonstrate dorsomedial hypothalamus contains bmal1 based oscillator can drive food entrainment circadian rhythms
