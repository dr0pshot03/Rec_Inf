increased longevities post-paleozoic marine genera mass extinctions 
cohorts marine taxa originated recoveries mass extinctions commonly widespread spatially originating times coupled recognition correlation geographic ranges temporal longevities marine taxa observation predicts recovery taxa unusually long-lived geologically analyzed possibility assessing longevities marine genus cohorts originated successive substages throughout phanerozoic results confirm several mass extinction recovery cohorts significantly longer lived cohorts effect limited post-paleozoic suggesting differences dynamics paleozoic versus post-paleozoic diversification
