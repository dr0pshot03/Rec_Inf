superplastic nanofibrous slip zones control seismogenic fault friction 
understanding internal mechanisms controlling fault friction crucial understanding seismogenic slip active faults displacement fault zones frequently localized highly reflective mirrorlike slip surfaces coated thin films nanogranular fault rock show mirror-slip surfaces developed experimentally simulated calcite faults consist aligned nanogranular chains fibers ductile room conditions microstructures associated frictional data suggest fault-slip mechanism resembling classical ashby-verrall superplasticity capable producing unstable fault slip diffusive mass transfer nanocrystalline calcite gouge shown fast enough mechanism control seismogenesis limestone terrains nanogranular fault surfaces becoming increasingly recognized crustal faults proposed mechanism may generally relevant crustal seismogenesis
