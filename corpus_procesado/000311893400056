fucose sensing regulates bacterial intestinal colonization 
mammalian gastrointestinal tract provides complex competitive environment microbiota successful colonization pathogens requires scavenging nutrients sensing chemical signals competing resident bacteria precisely regulating expression virulence genes gastrointestinal pathogen enterohaemorrhagic escherichia coli ehec relies inter-kingdom chemical sensing systems regulate virulence gene expression show systems control expression novel two-component signal transduction system named fuskr fusk histidine sensor kinase fusr response regulator fusk senses fucose controls expression virulence metabolic genes fucose-sensing system required robust ehec colonization mammalian intestine fucose highly abundant intestine bacteroides theta-iotaomicron produces multiple fucosidases cleave fucose host glycans resulting high fucose availability gut lumen growth mucin b thetaiotaomicron contributes ehec virulence cleaving fucose mucin thereby activating fuskr signalling cascade modulating virulence gene expression ehec findings suggest ehec uses fucose host-derived signal made available microbiota modulate ehec pathogenicity metabolism
