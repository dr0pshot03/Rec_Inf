propagating phonons coupled artificial atom 
quantum information can stored micromechanical resonators encoded quanta vibration known phonons vibrational motion restricted stationary eigenmodes resonator thus serves local storage phonons contrast couple propagating phonons artificial atom quantum regime reproduce findings quantum optics sound taking role light results highlight similarities phonons photons also point new opportunities arising characteristic features quantum mechanical sound low propagation speed phonons enable new dynamic schemes processing quantum information short wavelength allows regimes atomic physics explored reached photonic systems
