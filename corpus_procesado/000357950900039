supramolecular assemblies underpin turnover outer membrane proteins bacteria 
gram-negative bacteria inhabit broad range ecological niches escherichia coli includes river water well humans animals can commensal pathogen- intricate regulatory mechanisms ensure bacteria right complement beta-barrel outer membrane proteins omps enable adaptation particular habitat yet mechanism known replacing omps outer membrane issue confounded lack energy source high stability abundance omps uncover process underpinning omp turnover escherichia coli show passive binary nature old omps displaced poles growing cells new omps take place using fluorescent colicins omp-specific probes combination ensemble single-molecule fluorescence microscopy vivo vitro well molecular dynamics simulations established mechanism binary omp partitioning omps clustered form -mu m diameter islands diffusion restricted promiscuous interactions omps omp islands distributed throughout cell contained bam complex catalyses insertion omps outer membrane however omp biogenesis occurred gradient highest mid-cell largely absent cell poles cumulative effect push old omp islands towards poles growing cells leading binary distribution cells divide hence outer membrane gram-negative bacterium spatially temporally organized structure organization lies heart omps turned membrane
