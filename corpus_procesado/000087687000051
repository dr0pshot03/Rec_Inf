proliferation growth blocked conditional deletion 40s ribosomal protein s6 
ribosome biogenesis plays essential role cell proliferation control mechanisms may evolved recognize lesions critical anabolic process test possibility conditionally deleted gene encoding 40s ribosomal protein s6 liver adult mice unexpectedly livers fasted animals deficient s6 grew response nutrients even though biogenesis 40s ribosomes abolished however liver cells failed proliferate induce cyclin e expression partial hepatectomy despite formation active cyclin d-cdk4 complexes results imply abrogation 40s ribosome biogenesis may induce checkpoint control prevents cell cycle progression
