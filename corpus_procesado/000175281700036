climatology suns role climate variations
sun controller climate changes instigator changes mostly forced system feedbacks simply convenient scapegoat climate variations lacking obvious cause question addressed suggested solar forcing mechanisms operating time scales billions years decades mechanism fails generate expected climate response important respects although relations found magnitude system feedbacks variability appears large larger solar forcing making suns true role ambiguous sun provides explicit external forcing better understanding cause effect climate change help us evaluate importance climate forcings past future greenhouse gas changes
