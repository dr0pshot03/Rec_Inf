evidence primordial water earths deep mantle 
hydrogen-isotope [deuterium/hydrogen d/h] ratio earth can used constrain origin water however accessible reservoir earths oceans may longer represent original primordial d/h ratio owing changes caused water cycling surface interior thus reservoir completely isolated surface processes required define earths original d/h signature present data baffin island icelandic lavas suggest deep mantle low d/h ratio delta d negative per mil strongly negative values indicate existence component within earths interior inherited d/h ratio directly protosolar nebula
