debris disks around young stars analogues kuiper belt solar system show variety non-trivial structures attributed planetary perturbations used constrain properties planets- however analyses largely ignored fact debris disks found contain small quantities gas- component disks contain level several debris disks measured dust-to-gas ratio unity- effect hydrodynamics structure disk ignored report linear nonlinear modelling shows dust-gas interactions can produce key patterns attributed planets find robust clumping instability organizes dust narrow eccentric rings similar fomalhaut debris disk conclusion disks might contain planets necessarily required explain systems
