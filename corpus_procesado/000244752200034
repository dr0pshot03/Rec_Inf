anaphase onset complete dna replication intact checkpoint responses 
cellular checkpoints prevent mitosis presence stalled replication forks whether checkpoints also ensure completion dna replication mitosis unknown show yeast smc5-smc6 mutants related cohesin condensin replication delayed significantly natural replication-impeding loci like ribosomal dna gene cluster absence smc5-smc6 chromosome nondisjunction occurs consequence mitotic entry unfinished replication despite intact checkpoint responses eliminating processes obstruct replication fork progression restores temporal uncoupling replication segregation smc5-smc6 mutants propose completion replication surveillance known checkpoints
