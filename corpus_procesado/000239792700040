signature clear co2 ice cryptic regions mars south seasonal polar cap
seasonal polar ice caps mars composed mainly co2 ice region low < % albedo observed within south seasonal cap early mid-spring low temperature cryptic region attributed clear slab nearly pure co2 ice low albedo resulting absorption underlying surface report near-infrared imaging spectroscopy south seasonal cap deep broad co2 absorption bands expected near-infrared thick transparent slab co2 ice observed models observed spectra indicate low albedo results extensive dust contamination close surface co2 ice layer linked atmospheric circulation patterns strength co2 absorption increases mid-spring part dust either carried away buried deeply ice layer co2 ice sublimation process
