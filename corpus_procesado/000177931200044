alkb-mediated oxidative demethylation reverses dna damage escherichia coli 
bacterial alkb protein known involved cellular recovery alkylation damage however function protein remains unknown alkb homologues identified several organisms including humans recent sequence alignment study suggested proteins may belong superfamily oxoglutarate-dependent iron-dependent oxygenases 2og-feii-oxygenases show alkb escherichia coli indeed oxoglutarate-dependent iron-dependent dna repair enzyme releases replication blocks alkylated dna mechanism involving oxidative demethylation methyladenine residues mechanism represents new pathway dna repair third type dna damage reversal mechanism far discovered
