evolutionary information specifying protein fold
classical studies show many proteins information required specifying tertiary structure contained amino acid sequence attempt define sequence rules specifying protein fold computationally creating artificial protein sequences using statistical information encoded multiple sequence alignment tertiary structure information experimental testing libraries artificial ww domain sequences shows simple statistical energy function capturing coevolution amino acid residues necessary sufficient specify sequences fold native structures artificial proteins show thermodynamic stabilities similar natural ww domains structure determination one artificial protein shows excellent agreement ww fold atomic resolution relative simplicity information used creating sequences suggests marked reduction potential complexity protein folding problem
