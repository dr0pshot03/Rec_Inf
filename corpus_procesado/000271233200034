improved attribution climate forcing emissions 
evaluating multicomponent climate change mitigation strategies requires knowledge diverse direct indirect effects emissions methane ozone aerosols linked atmospheric chemistry emissions single pollutant can affect several species calculated atmospheric composition changes historical radiative forcing forcing per unit emission due aerosol tropospheric ozone precursor emissions coupled composition-climate model found gas-aerosol interactions substantially alter relative importance various emissions particular methane emissions larger impact used current carbon-trading schemes kyoto protocol thus assessments multigas mitigation policies well separate efforts mitigate warming short-lived pollutants include gas-aerosol interactions
