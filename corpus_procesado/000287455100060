classic selective sweeps rare recent human evolution 
efforts identify genetic basis human adaptations polymorphism data sought footprints classic selective sweeps beneficial mutation arises rapidly fixes population yet remains unknown whether form natural selection common evolution examined evidence classic sweeps resequencing data human genomes expected recurrent-sweep model found diversity levels decrease near exons conserved noncoding regions contrast expectation however trough diversity around human-specific amino acid substitutions pronounced around synonymous substitutions moreover relative genome background amino acid putative regulatory sites significantly enriched alleles highly differentiated populations findings indicate classic sweeps dominant mode human adaptation past similar years
