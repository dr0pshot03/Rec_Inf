astrocytes mediate synapse elimination megf10 mertk pathways
achieve precise neural connectivity developing mammalian nervous system undergoes extensive activity-dependent synapse remodelling recently microglial cells shown responsible portion synaptic pruning remaining mechanisms remain unknown report new role astrocytes actively engulfing central nervous system synapses process helps mediate synapse elimination requires megf10 mertk phagocytic pathways strongly dependent neuronal activity developing mice deficient astrocyte pathways fail refine retinogeniculate connections normally retain excess functional synapses finally show adult mouse brain astrocytes continuously engulf excitatory inhibitory synapses studies reveal novel role astrocytes mediating synapse elimination developing adult brain identify megf10 mertk critical proteins synapse remodelling underlying neural circuit refinement important implications understanding learning memory well neurological disease processes
