decapping decay messenger rna occur cytoplasmic processing bodies 
major pathway eukaryotic messenger rna mrna turnover begins deadenylation followed decapping exonucleolytic decay provide evidence mrna decapping degradation occur discrete cytoplasmic foci yeast call processing bodies p bodies first proteins activate catalyze decapping concentrated p bodies second inhibiting mrna turnover decapping leads loss p bodies however inhibiting turnover decapping increases abundance size p bodies finally mrna degradation intermediates localized p bodies results de ne flux mrnas polysomes p bodies critical aspect cytoplasmic mrna metabolism possible site regulation mrna degradation
