dynamic knockout reveals conformational fluctuations influence chemical step enzyme catalysis 
conformational dynamics play key role enzyme catalysis although protein motions clear implications ligand flux role dynamics chemical step enzyme catalysis clearly established generated mutant escherichia coli dihydrofolate reductase abrogates millisecond-time-scale fluctuations enzyme active site without perturbing structural electrostatic preorganization dynamic knockout severely impairs hydride transfer thus found link conformational fluctuations millisecond time scale chemical step enzymatic reaction broad implications understanding enzyme mechanisms design novel protein catalysts
