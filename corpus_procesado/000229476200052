sv40-encoded micrornas regulate viral gene expression reduce susceptibility cytotoxic t cells 
micrornas mirnas small similar nucleotide rnas lower organisms serve important regulatory roles development gene expression typically forming imperfect duplexes target messenger rnas1 mirnas also described mammalian cells infections epstein barr virus ebv function unknown although one ebv mirna probably altered processing viral mrna regulatory significance event uncertain transcripts exist can supply targeted function report identification mirnas encoded simian virus sv40 define functional significance viral infection svmirnas accumulate late times infection perfectly complementary early viral mrnas target mrnas cleavage reduces expression viral t antigens reduce yield infectious virus relative generated mutant lacking svmirnas however wild-type sv40-infected cells less sensitive mutant lysis cytotoxic t cells trigger less cytokine production cells thus viral evolution taken advantage mirna pathway generate effectors enhance probability successful infection
