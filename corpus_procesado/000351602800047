regulated eukaryotic dna replication origin firing purified proteins
eukaryotic cells initiate dna replication multiple origins must tightly regulated promote precise genome duplication every cell cycle accomplish initiation partitioned two temporally discrete steps: double hexameric minichromosome maintenance mcm complex first loaded replication origins g1 phase converted active cmg cdc45-mcm-gins helicase s phase describe reconstitution budding yeast dna replication initiation purified replication factors made polypeptides origin-dependent initiation recapitulates regulation seen vivo cyclin-dependent kinase cdk inhibits mcm loading phosphorylating origin recognition complex orc promotes cmg formation phosphorylating sld2 sld3 dbf4-dependent kinase ddk promotes replication phosphorylating mcm can act either cdk experiments define minimum complement proteins protein kinase substrates co-factors required regulated eukaryotic dna replication
