potassium channels k+-selective protein pores cell membrane selectivity filter functional unit allows k+ channels distinguish potassium k+ sodium na+ ions filters structure depends whether k+ na+ ions bound inside synthesized k+ channel containing d-enantiomer alanine place conserved glycine found x-ray crystallography filter maintains k+ conductive structure presence na+ low concentrations k+ channel conducts na+ absence k+ presence k+ findings demonstrate ability channel adapt structure differently k+ na+ fundamental aspect ion selectivity ability multiple k+ ions compete effectively na+ conductive filter
