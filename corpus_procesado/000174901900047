deubiquitination p53 hausp important pathway p53 stabilization
p53 tumour suppressor short-lived protein maintained low levels normal cells mdm2-mediated ubiquitination subsequent proteolysis- stabilization p53 crucial tumour suppressor function- however precise mechanism ubiquitinated p53 levels regulated vivo completely understood mass spectrometry affinity-purified p53-associated factors identified herpesvirus-associated ubiquitin-specific protease hausp novel p53-interacting protein hausp strongly stabilizes p53 even presence excess mdm2 also induces p53-dependent cell growth repression apoptosis significantly hausp intrinsic enzymatic activity specifically deubiquitinates p53 vitro vivo contrast expression catalytically inactive point mutant hausp cells increases levels p53 ubiquitination destabilizes p53 findings reveal important mechanism p53 can stabilized direct deubiquitination also imply hausp might function tumour suppressor vivo stabilization p53
