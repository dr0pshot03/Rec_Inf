regulation dendritic protein synthesis miniature synaptic events 
examined dendritic protein synthesis prolonged blockade action potentials alone blockade action potentials miniature excitatory synaptic events minis relative controls dendrites exposed prolonged blockade action potentials showed diminished protein synthesis dendrites action potentials minis blocked showed enhanced protein synthesis suggesting minis inhibit dendritic translation minis acutely blocked stimulated immediate increase decrease respectively dendritic translation observed taken together results reveal role miniature synaptic events acute regulation dendritic protein synthesis neurons
