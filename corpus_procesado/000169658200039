gene families arabidopsis thaliana pollen coat proteome 
pollen extracellular matrix contains proteins mediating species specificity components needed efficient pollination identified proteins > kilodaltons arabidopsis pollen coating showed corresponding genes reside two genomic clusters one cluster encodes six lipases whereas contains six lipid-binding oleosin genes including grp17 gene promotes efficient pollination individual oleosins exhibit extensive divergence eco types entire cluster remains intact analysis syntenic region brassica oleracea revealed even greater divergence similar clustering genes allelic flexibility may promote speciation plants
