light-induced shape-memory polymers 
materials said show shape-memory effect can deformed fixed temporary shape recover original permanent shape exposure external stimulus- shape-memory polymers received increasing attention scientific technological significance principle thermally induced shape-memory effect can activated increase temperature also obtained heating exposure electrical current light illumination several papers described light-induced changes shape polymers- gels- contraction- bending- volume changes report polymers containing cinnamic groups can deformed fixed predetermined shapes exclusively elongated films tubes arches spirals ultraviolet light illumination new shapes stable long time periods even heated degrees c can recover original shape ambient temperatures exposed ultraviolet light different wavelength ability polymers form different pre-determined temporary shapes subsequently recover original shape ambient temperatures remote light activation lead variety potential medical applications
