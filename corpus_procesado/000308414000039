ecological populations bacteria act socially cohesive units antibiotic production resistance 
animals plants social structure can reduce conflict within populations bias aggression toward competing populations however bacteria wild remains unknown whether population-level organization exists show environmental bacteria organized socially cohesive units antagonism occurs rather within ecologically defined populations screening approximately possible mutual interactions among vibrionaceae isolates ocean show genotypic clusters known cohesive habitat association also act units terms antibiotic production resistance genetic analyses show within populations broad-range antibiotics produced genotypes whereas others resistant suggesting cooperation conspecifics natural antibiotics may thus mediate competition populations rather solely increase success individuals
