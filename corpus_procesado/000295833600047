global extent determinants savanna forest alternative biome states
theoretically fire-tree cover feedbacks can maintain savanna forest alternative stable states however global extent fire-driven discontinuities tree cover unknown especially accounting seasonality soils use tree cover climate fire soils data sets show tree cover globally discontinuous climate influences tree cover globally intermediate rainfall millimeters mild seasonality less months tree cover bimodal fire differentiates savanna forest may alternative states large areas including parts amazonia congo changes biome distributions whether cost savanna due fragmentation forest due climate will neither smooth easily reversible
