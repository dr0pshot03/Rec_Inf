survival hypoxia c-elegans inactivation aminoacyl-trna synthetases 
hypoxia important wide range biological processes animal hibernation cell survival particularly relevant many diseases sensitivity cells organisms hypoxic injury varies widely molecular basis variation incompletely understood using forward genetic screens caenorhabditis elegans isolated hypoxia resistant reduction function mutant rrt encodes arginyl transfer rna trna synthetase enzyme essential protein translation knockdown rrt genes encoding aminoacyl trna synthetases rescued animals hypoxia induced death level hypoxia resistance inversely correlated translation rate unfolded protein response induced hypoxia required hypoxia resistance reduction function mutant rrt thus translational suppression produces hypoxia resistance part reducing unfolded protein toxicity
