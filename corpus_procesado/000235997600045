robust salmonella metabolism limits possibilities new antimicrobials 
new antibiotics urgently needed control infectious diseases metabolic enzymes represent attractive targets antibiotics vivo target validation largely lacking obtained vivo information salmonella enterica enzymes network analysis mutant phenotypes genome comparisons salmonella proteomes infected mice enzymes non essential salmonella virulence reflecting extensive metabolic redundancies access surprisingly diverse host nutrients essential enzymes identified almost exclusively associated small subgroup pathways enabling us perform nearly exhaustive screen sixty four enzymes identified essential salmonella conserved important human pathogens almost belong metabolic pathways inhibited current antibiotics previously considered antimicrobial development comprehensive vivo analysis thus suggests shortage new metabolic targets broad spectrum antibiotics draws attention previously known unexploited targets
