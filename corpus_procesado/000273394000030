two white dwarfs oxygen-rich atmospheres 
stars masses ranging times mass sun end lives either massive white dwarfs weak type ii supernovae limited observational constraints either evolutionary channel report detection two white dwarfs large photospheric oxygen abundances implying bare oxygen-neon cores may descended massive progenitors avoid core collapse
