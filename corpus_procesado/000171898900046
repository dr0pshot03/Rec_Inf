vitro evolution suggests multiple origins hammerhead ribozyme
hammerhead ribozyme originally discovered group rnas associated plant viruses subsequently identified genome newt notophthalamus viridescens schistosomes cave crickets dolichopoda species sporadic occurrence self-cleaving rna motif highly divergent organisms consequence early evolution hammerhead ribozyme extant examples descended single ancestral progenitor alternatively hammerhead ribozyme may evolved independently many times better understand observed distribution hammerhead ribozymes used vitro selection search unbiased sample random sequences comparably active self-cleaving motifs show near-physiological conditions hammerhead ribozyme motif common thus simplest rna structure capable self-cleavage biologically observed rates results suggest evolutionary process may channelled nature laboratory towards repeated selection simplest solution biochemical problem
