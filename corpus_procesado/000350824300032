strongly correlated quantum walks optical lattices
full control dynamics interacting indistinguishable quantum particles important prerequisite experimental study strongly correlated quantum matter implementation high-fidelity quantum information processing demonstrate control quantum walk-the quantum mechanical analog classical random walk-in regime dynamics dominated interparticle interactions using interacting bosonic atoms optical lattice directly observed fundamental effects emergence correlations two-particle quantum walks well strongly correlated bloch oscillations tilted optical lattices approach can scaled larger systems greatly extending class problems accessible via quantum walks
