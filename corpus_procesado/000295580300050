linking long-term dietary patterns gut microbial enterotypes 
diet strongly affects human health partly modulating gut microbiome composition used diet inventories 16s rdna sequencing characterize fecal samples individuals fecal communities clustered enterotypes distinguished primarily levels bacteroides prevotella enterotypes strongly associated long-term diets particularly protein animal fat bacteroides versus carbohydrates prevotella controlled-feeding study subjects showed microbiome composition changed detectably within hours initiating high-fat/low-fiber low-fat/high-fiber diet enterotype identity remained stable -day study thus alternative enterotype states associated long-term diet
