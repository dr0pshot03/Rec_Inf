sirt6 promotes dna repair stress activating parp1
sirtuin sirt6 mammalian homolog yeast sir2 deacetylase mice deficient sirt6 exhibit genome instability show mammalian cells subjected oxidative stress sirt6 recruited sites dna double-strand breaks dsbs stimulates dsb repair nonhomologous end joining homologous recombination results indicate sirt6 physically associates poly[adenosine diphosphate adp-ribose] polymerase parp1 mono-adp-ribosylates parp1 lysine residue thereby stimulating parp1 poly-adp-ribosylase activity enhancing dsb repair oxidative stress
