fruit flies diversify offspring response parasite infection
evolution sexual reproduction often explained red queen dynamics: organisms must continually evolve maintain fitness relative interacting organisms parasites recombination accompanies sexual reproduction helps diversify organisms offspring parasites exploit static host genotypes show drosophila melanogaster plastically increases production recombinant offspring infection response consistent across genetic backgrounds developmental stages parasite types induced sterile wounding furthermore response appears driven transmission distortion rather increased recombination study extends red queen model include increased production recombinant offspring uncovers remarkable ability hosts actively distort recombination fraction rapid response environmental cues
