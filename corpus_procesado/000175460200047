microtubule basis left-handed helical growth arabidopsis
left-right asymmetry plants can found helices stalks stems tendrils fan-like petal arrangements handedness asymmetric structures often fixed given species indicating genetic factors control asymmetric development show dominant negative mutations tubulin intradimer interface alpha-tubulins cause left-handed helical growth clockwise twisting elongating organs arabidopsis thaliana demonstrate mutant tubulins incorporate microtubule polymers producing right-handed obliquely oriented cortical arrays root epidermal cells cortical microtubules mutants increased sensitivity microtubule-specific drugs results suggest reduced microtubule stability can produce left-handed helical growth plants
