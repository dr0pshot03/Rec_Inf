three-dimensional super-resolution imaging stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy
recent advances far field fluorescence microscopy led substantial improvements image resolution achieving near molecular resolution nanometers two lateral dimensions three dimensional 3d nanoscale resolution imaging however remains challenge demonstrated 3d stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy storm using optical astigmatism determine axial lateral positions individual fluorophores nanometer accuracy iterative stochastic activation photoswitchable probes enables high precision 3d localization probe thus construction 3d image without scanning sample using approach achieved image resolution nanometers lateral dimensions nanometers axial dimension development allowed us resolve 3d morphology nanoscopic cellular structures
