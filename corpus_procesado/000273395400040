reproducibility distinguishes conscious nonconscious neural representations
qualifies neural representation role subjective experience previous evidence suggests duration intensity neural response sensory stimulus factors introduce another attribute-the reproducibility pattern neural activity across different episodes-that predicts specific measurable differences conscious nonconscious neural representations indepedently duration intensity found conscious neural activation patterns relatively reproducible compared nonconscious neural activation patterns corresponding perceptual content adequately explained difference signal-to-noise ratio
