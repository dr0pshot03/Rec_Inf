structural basis semaphorin signalling plexin receptor 
semaphorins receptor plexins constitute pleiotropic cell-signalling system used wide variety biological processes protein families implicated numerous human diseases1- binding soluble membrane-anchored semaphorins membrane-distal region plexin ecto-domain activates plexins intrinsic gtpase-activating protein gap cytoplasmic region ultimately modulating cellular adhesion behaviour5 however structural mechanism underlying receptor activation remains largely unknown report crystal structures semaphorin 6a sema6a receptor-binding fragment plexin a2 plxna2 ligand-binding fragment pre-signalling binding signalling complex formation states binding sema6a ectodomain expected face-to-face homodimer arrangement similar adopted sema3a sema4d whereas plxna2 unexpected head-on homodimer arrangement contrast structure sema6a-plxna2 signalling complex revealed : heterotetramer two plxna2 monomers dissociated one another docked onto top face sema6a homodimer using interface head-on homodimer indicating plexins undergo partner exchange cell-based activity measurements using mutant ligands/receptors confirmed sema6a face-to-face dimer arrangement physiologically relevant maintained throughout signalling events thus homodimer-to-heterodimer transitions cell-surface plexin result specific orientation molecular axis relative membrane may constitute structural mechanism ligand-binding signal transmitted cytoplasmic region inducing gap domain rearrangements activation
