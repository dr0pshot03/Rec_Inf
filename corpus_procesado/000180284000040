ringlike structure deinococcus radiodurans genome: key radioresistance 
bacterium deinococcus radiodurans survives ionizing irradiation dna-damaging assaults doses lethal organisms d radiodurans accurately reconstructs genome hundreds radiation-generated fragments absence intact template unknown show d radiodurans genome assumes unusual toroidal morphology may contribute radioresistance propose restricted diffusion within tightly packed laterally ordered dna toroids radiation-generated free dna ends held together may facilitate template-independent yet error-free joining dna breaks
