mast cells: cellular link autoantibodies inflammatory arthritis 
previous studies revealed autoantibodies complement components fc receptors participate pathogenesis erosive arthritis k/bxn mice however known cellular populations responsive inflammatory signals find two strains mice deficient mast cells w/w-v sl/sld resistant development joint inflammation susceptibility restored w/w-v strain mast cell engraftment thus mast cells may function cellular link autoantibodies soluble mediators effector populations inflammatory arthritis
