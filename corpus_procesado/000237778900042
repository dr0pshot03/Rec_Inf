pten dependence distinguishes haematopoietic stem cells leukaemia-initiating cells 
recent advances highlighted extensive phenotypic functional similarities normal stem cells cancer stem cells raises question whether disease therapies can developed eliminate cancer stem cells without eliminating normal stem cells address issue conditionally deleting pten tumour suppressor gene adult haematopoietic cells led myeloproliferative disease within days transplantable leukaemias within weeks pten deletion also promoted haematopoietic stem cell hsc proliferation however led hsc depletion via cell-autonomous mechanism preventing cells stably reconstituting irradiated mice contrast leukaemia-initiating cells hscs therefore unable maintain without pten effects mostly mediated mtor inhibited rapamycin rapamycin depleted leukaemia-initiating cells also restored normal hsc function mechanistic differences normal stem cells cancer stem cells can thus targeted deplete cancer stem cells without damaging normal stem cells
