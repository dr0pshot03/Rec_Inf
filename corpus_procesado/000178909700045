progenitor cell maintenance requires numb numblike mouse neurogenesis 
neurons regions mammalian nervous system generated extended period time development maintaining sufficient numbers progenitors course neurogenesis essential ensure neural cells produced correct numbers diverse types- underlying molecular mechanisms like governing stem-cell self-renewal general remain poorly understood report mouse numb numblike nbl- two highly conserved homologues drosophila numb play redundant critical roles maintaining neural progenitor cells embryogenesis allowing progenies choose progenitor neuronal fates nbl mutant embryos also conditionally mutant mouse numb nervous system early neurons emerge expected spatial temporal pattern expense progenitor cells leading nearly complete depletion dividing cells shortly onset neurogenesis findings show shared molecular mechanism mouse numb nbl key components governs self-renewal neural progenitor cells regardless lineage regional identities
