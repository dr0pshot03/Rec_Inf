mars paleomagnetic field result single-hemisphere dynamo 
mars crustal magnetic field likely generated dynamo action planets early history unexplained characteristics field include strength concentration southern hemisphere lack correlation surface features except hemispheric crustal dichotomy used numerical dynamo modeling demonstrate mechanisms proposed explain crustal dichotomy formation can result single hemisphere dynamo dynamo produces strong magnetic fields southern hemisphere magnetic field morphology can explain mars crustal magnetic field intensities substantially stronger southern hemisphere without relying postdynamo mechanisms
