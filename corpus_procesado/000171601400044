carboxyl-terminal modulator protein ctmp negative regulator pkb/akt v-akt plasma membrane
pkb protein kinase b also called akt family protein kinases plays key role insulin signaling cellular survival transformation pkb activated phosphorylation residues threonine protein kinase pdk1 serine putative serine kinase several protein binding partners pkb identified describe protein partner pkb alpha termed ctmp carboxyl-terminal modulator protein binds specifically carboxyl-terminal regulatory domain pkb alpha plasma membrane binding ctmp reduces activity pkb alpha inhibiting phosphorylation serine threonine moreover ctmp expression reverts phenotype v-akt-transformed cells examined number criteria including cell morphology growth rate vivo tumorigenesis findings identify ctmp negative regulatory component pathway controlling pkb activity
