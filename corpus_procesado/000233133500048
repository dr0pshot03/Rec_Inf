mutation accumulation assay reveals broad capacity rapid evolution gene expression
mutation ultimate source biological diversity generates variation fuels evolution gene expression first step organism translates genetic information developmental change estimate rate mutation produces new variation gene expression measuring transcript abundances across genome onset metamorphosis initially identical drosophila melanogaster lines independently accumulated mutations generations find statistically significant mutational variation % genome wide range variability across corresponding genes genes upregulated development variability decreases downregulated increases indicating developmental context affects evolution gene expression strong correlation mutational variance environmental variance shows potential widespread canalization comparing evolutionary rates report differences species conclude gene expression evolve according strictly neutral models although spontaneous mutations potential generate abundant variation gene expression natural variation relatively constrained
