coupling agonist binding channel gating ach-binding protein linked ion channel
neurotransmitter receptors cys-loop superfamily couple binding agonist opening intrinsic ion pore final step rapid synaptic transmission although atomic resolution structural data recently emerged individual binding pore domains linked functional unit remains unknown identify structural requirements functionally coupling two domains combining acetylcholine ach-binding protein whose structure determined atomic resolution pore domain serotonin type-3a -ht3a receptor amino-acid sequences three loops ach-binding protein changed ht3a counterparts ach bind low affinity characteristic activatable receptors trigger opening ion pore thus functional coupling requires structural compatibility interface binding pore domains structural modelling reveals network interacting loops binding pore domains mediates allosteric coupling process
