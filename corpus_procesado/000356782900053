cell death crisis mediated mitotic telomere deprotection 
tumour formation blocked two barriers: replicative senescence crisis senescence triggered short telomeres bypassed disruption tumour-suppressive pathways senescence bypass cells undergo crisis almost cells population die cells escape crisis harbour unstable genomes parameters transformation mechanism cell death crisis remains unexplained show human cells crisis undergo spontaneous mitotic arrest resulting death mitosis following cell cycle phenotype induced loss p53 function suppressed telomerase overexpression telomere fusions triggered mitotic arrest p53-compromised non-crisis cells indicating fusions underlying cause cell death exacerbation mitotic telomere deprotection partial trf2 also known terf2 knockdown increased ratio cells died duringmitotic arrest sensitized cancer cells mitotic poisons propose crisis pathway wherein chromosome fusions induce mitotic arrest resulting mitotic telomere deprotection cell death thereby eliminating precancerous cells population
