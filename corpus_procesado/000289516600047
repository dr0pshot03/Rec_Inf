noncanonical tgf beta signaling contributes aortic aneurysm progression marfan syndrome mice 
transforming growth factor-beta tgf beta signaling drives aneurysm progression multiple disorders including marfan syndrome mfs therapies inhibit signaling cascade clinical trials tgf beta can stimulate multiple intracellular signaling pathways unclear pathways drives aortic disease inhibited result disease amelioration show extracellular signal-regulated kinase erk smad2 activated mouse model mfs inhibited therapies directed tgf beta whereas selective inhibition erk1/ activation ameliorated aortic growth smad4 deficiency exacerbated aortic disease caused premature death mfs mice smad4-deficient mfs mice uniquely showed activation jun n-terminal kinase- jnk1 jnk antagonist ameliorated aortic growth mfs mice lacked retained full smad4 expression thus noncanonical smad-independent tgf beta signaling prominent driver aortic disease mfs mice inhibition erk1/ jnk1 pathways potential therapeutic strategy disease
