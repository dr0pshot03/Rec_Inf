discovery mg al suggests neutron drip-line slant towards heavier isotopes 
fundamental question nuclear physics combinations neutrons protons can make nucleus many hundreds exotic neutron-rich isotopes never observed limit many neutrons given number protons can bind unknown lightest elements owing delicate interplay single particle collective quantum effects nucleus limit known neutron drip line provides benchmark models atomic nucleus report significant advance determination limit: discovery two new neutron-rich isotopes-mg al--that predicted drip-line nuclei past several attempts observe mg unsuccessful moreover observation al provides experimental indication neutron drip line may located towards heavier isotopes mass region currently believed stable nuclei attractive pairing forces enhance stability isotopes even numbers protons neutrons contrast present work shows nuclei drip line gain stability unpaired proton narrows shell gaps provides opportunity bind many neutrons
