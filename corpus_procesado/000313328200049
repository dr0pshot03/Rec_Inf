influence threonine metabolism s-adenosylmethionine histone methylation
threonine amino acid critically required pluripotency mouse embryonic stem cells mescs detailed mechanism remains unclear found threonine s-adenosylmethionine sam metabolism coupled pluripotent stem cells resulting regulation histone methylation isotope labeling mescs revealed threonine provides substantial fraction cellular glycine acetyl-coenzyme coa needed sam synthesis depletion threonine culture medium threonine dehydrogenase tdh mescs decreased accumulation sam decreased trimethylation histone h3 lysine h3k4me3 leading slowed growth increased differentiation thus abundance sam appears influence h3k4me3 providing possible mechanism modulation metabolic pathway might influence stem cell fate
