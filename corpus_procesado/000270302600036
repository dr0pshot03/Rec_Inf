x-ray observation transient hemiaminal trapped porous network 
x-ray crystallography method choice direct structural analysis crystalline compounds1 extending use situ mapping chemical transformations provide valuable insights illustrated time-resolved x-ray crystallography studies23; however transient nature unstable reaction intermediates often poses significant challenge recently demonstrated standard chemical reactions can occur within pores porous coordination networks4- robust crystallinity networks facilitates situ x-ray analysis adducts products7- show systems even enable x-ray observations reaction intermediates usually transient non-isolable proof-of-concept demonstration examines simple ubiquitous reaction amine aldehyde normally form short-lived hemiaminal yields schiff-base product mechanism reaction exhaustively examined hemiaminal intermediate rarely observed12- first determine structure porous network aromatic amine embedded diffuse aldehyde substrate material transform amine hemiaminal intermediate kinetically trapped thus amenable x-ray analysis finally raise temperature system obtain imine product determine structure results establish porous network materials provide means obtaining sequential x-ray-based snapshots structural transformations occur chemical reactions
