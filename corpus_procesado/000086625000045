visual behaviour mediated retinal projections directed auditory pathway
unresolved issue cortical development concerns relative contributions intrinsic extrinsic factors functional specification different cortical areas- ferrets retinal projections redirected neonatally auditory thalamus visually responsive cells auditory thalamus cortex form retinotopic map auditory cortex visual receptive field properties auditory cortex typical cells visual cortex- report cross-modal projection representation auditory cortex can mediate visual behaviour light stimuli presented portion visual field seen projection rewired ferrets respond though perceive stimuli visual rather auditory thus perceptual modality neocortical region instructed significant extent extrinsic inputs addition gratings different spatial frequencies can discriminated rewired pathway although grating acuity lower normal visual pathway
