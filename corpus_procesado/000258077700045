censoring autoreactive b cell development pre-b cell receptor 
antibody diversity occurs randomly b cells recombine immunoglobulin ig heavy light chain genes development process inevitably generates reactivity self structures several mechanisms prevent development autoreactive b cells report role pre b cell receptor composed ig heavy surrogate light chains negative selection cells expressing ig heavy chains potential generate autoantibodies surrogate light chain deficient slc-/- mice harbored elevated levels antinuclear antibodies anas serum showed evidence escape pre b cells expressing prototypic autoantibody heavy chains negative selection leading mature autoantibody secreting cd21-cd23- b cells periphery thus pre b cell receptor appears censor development certain autoantibody secreting cells may represent important factor multifactorial autoimmune diseases
