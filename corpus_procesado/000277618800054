plant-like kinase plasmodium falciparum regulates parasite egress erythrocytes 
clinical malaria associated proliferation plasmodium parasites human erythrocytes coordinated processes parasite egress invasion erythrocytes rapid tightly regulated found plant-like calcium-dependent protein kinase pfcdpk5 expressed invasive merozoite forms plasmodium falciparum critical egress parasites deficient pfcdpk5 arrested mature schizonts intact membranes despite normal maturation egress proteases invasion ligands merozoites physically released stalled schizonts capable invading new erythrocytes separating pathways egress invasion arrest downstream cyclic guanosine monophosphate-dependent protein kinase pfpkg function independent protease processing thus pfcdpk5 plays essential role blood stage malaria replication
