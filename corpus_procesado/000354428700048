pirna-guided transposon cleavage initiates zucchini-dependent phased pirna production 
piwi-interacting rnas pirnas protect animal germ line silencing transposons primary pirnas generated transcripts genomic transposon junkyards pirna clusters amplified ping-pong pathway yielding secondary pirnas report secondary pirnas bound piwi protein ago3 can initiate primary pirna production cleaved transposon rnas first similar nucleotides nt cleaved rna becomes secondary pirna subsequent similar nt become first series phased primary pirnas bind piwi allowing pirnas spread beyond site rna cleavage ping-pong pathway increases abundance pirnas whereas production phased primary pirnas cleaved transposon rnas adds sequence diversity pirna pool allowing adaptation changes transposon sequence
