revealing maximum strength nanotwinned copper 
strength polycrystalline materials increases decreasing grain size critical size smaller grains might lead softening suggested atomistic simulations strongest size arise transition deformation mechanism lattice dislocation activities grain boundary related processes investigated maximum strength nanotwinned copper samples different twin thicknesses found strength increases decreasing twin thickness reaching maximum nanometers followed softening smaller values accompanied enhanced strain hardening tensile ductility strongest twin thickness originates transition yielding mechanism slip transfer across twin boundaries activity preexisting easy dislocation sources
