non-fluorous polymers high solubility supercritical co2 low pressures 
liquid supercritical carbon dioxide attracted much interest environmentally benign solvents1 practical use limited need high co2 pressures dissolve even small amounts polar amphiphilic organometallic high-molecular-mass compounds2- so-called co2-philes efficiently transport insoluble poorly soluble materials co2 solvent resulting development broad range co2 based processes including homogeneous heterogeneous polymerization extraction proteins metals homogeneous catalysis5- effective co2-philes expensive fluorocarbons polyperfluoroether commercialization otherwise promising co2-based processes met limited success show copolymers can act efficient non-fluorous co2-philes constituent monomers chosen optimize balance enthalpy entropy solute-copolymer copolymer-copolymer interactions guided heuristic rules regarding interactions used inexpensive propylene co2 synthesize series polyether-carbonate copolymers readily dissolve co2 low pressures even though non-fluorous polymers generally assumed co2-phobic expect design principles can used create wide range non-fluorous co2-philes low-cost raw materials thus rendering variety co2-based processes economically favourable particularly cases recycling co2-philes difficult
