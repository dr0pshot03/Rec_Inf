cyclic gmp-amp endogenous second messenger innate immune signaling cytosolic dna
cytosolic dna induces type interferons cytokines important antimicrobial defense can also result autoimmunity dna signaling pathway requires adaptor protein sting transcription factor irf3 mechanism dna sensing unclear found mammalian cytosolic extracts synthesized cyclic guanosine monophosphate-adenosine monophosphate cyclic gmp-amp cgamp vitro adenosine triphosphate guanosine triphosphate presence dna rna dna transfection dna virus infection mammalian cells also triggered cgamp production cgamp bound sting leading activation irf3 induction interferon-beta thus cgamp metazoans functions endogenous second messenger triggers interferon production response cytosolic dna
