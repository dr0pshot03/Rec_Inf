adaptation output chemotaxis signalling pathway 
bacterial chemotaxis network receptor clusters process input- flagellar motors generate output receptor motor complexes coupled diffusible protein chey-p receptor output steady-state concentration chey-p varies cell cell however motor ultrasensitive narrow operating range chey-p concentrations match receptor output motor input might optimized unclear show motor can shift operating range changing composition number flim subunits c-ring increases response decrement concentration chey-p increasing motor sensitivity shift sensitivity explains slow partial adaptation observed mutants lack receptor methyltransferase methylesterase motors show signal-dependent flim turnover adaptive remodelling likely common feature operation many molecular machines
