dna overwinds stretched 
dna often modelled isotropic rod1- chiral structure suggests possible importance anisotropic mechanical properties including coupling twisting stretching degrees freedom simple physical intuition predicts dna unwind tension pulled towards denatured structure4- used rotor bead tracking directly measure twist stretch coupling single dna molecules show small distortions contrary intuition dna overwinds tension reaching maximum twist tension similar pn tension increased critical value dna begins unwind observed twist stretch coupling predicts dna also lengthen overwound constant tension effect quantitatively confirm present simple model explains unusual mechanical properties also suggests possible origin anomalously large torsional rigidity dna results implications action dna-binding proteins must stretch twist dna compensate variability lengths binding sites9- requisite coupled dna distortions favoured intrinsic mechanical properties double helix reported
