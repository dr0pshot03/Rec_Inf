atom-by-atom structural chemical analysis annular dark-field electron microscopy 
direct imaging chemical identification atoms material unknown three-dimensional structure constitute powerful general analysis tool transmission electron microscopy principle able fulfil role many scientists including feynman realized early images matter electrons scatter strongly individual atoms whose wavelengths times smaller atom recently technique advanced greatly owing introduction aberration-corrected optics- however neither electron microscopy experimental technique yet able resolve identify atoms non-periodic material consisting several atomic species show annular dark-field imaging aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscope optimized low voltage operation can resolve identify chemical type every atom monolayer hexagonal boron nitride contains substitutional defects three types atomic substitutions found identified: carbon substituting boron carbon substituting nitrogen oxygen substituting nitrogen substitutions caused in-plane distortions boron nitride monolayer angstrom magnitude directly resolved verified density functional theory calculations results demonstrate atom-by-atom structural chemical analysis radiation-damage-resistant atoms present top ultrathin sheets now become possible
