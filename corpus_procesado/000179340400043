multiplicative computation visual neuron sensitive looming 
multiplicative operations important sensory processing- biophysical implementation remains largely unknown- investigated identified neuron lobula giant movement detector lgmd locusts whose output firing rate response looming visual stimuli described two models one involves multiplication model lgmd multiplies postsynaptically two inputs one excitatory one inhibitory converge onto dendritic tree model inhibition presynaptic lgmd using selective activation inactivation pre postsynaptic inhibition show postsynaptic inhibition predominant role suggesting multiplication implemented within neuron pharmacological experiments measurements firing rate versus membrane potential also reveal sodium channels act advance response lgmd time map membrane potential firing rate nearly exponential manner results consistent implementation multiplication based dendritic subtraction two converging inputs encoded logarithmically followed exponentiation active membrane conductances
