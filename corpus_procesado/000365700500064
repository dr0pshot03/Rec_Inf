mitochondrial dysfunction longevity animals: untangling knot 
mitochondria generate adenosine -triphosphate atp source potentially toxic reactive oxygen species ros suggested gradual mitochondrial dysfunction observed accompany aging fact causal aging process review findings suggest age-dependent mitochondrial dysfunction sufficient limit life span furthermore mitochondrial ros always deleterious can even stimulate pro-longevity pathways thus mitochondrial dysfunction plays complex role regulating longevity
