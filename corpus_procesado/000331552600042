nonswellable hydrogel without mechanical hysteresis 
hydrogels three-dimensional polymer networks contain large amount water inside certain hydrogels can injected solution transformed gel state required shape despite potential biomedical applications use hydrogels severely limited conventional hydrogels inevitably swell physiological conditions drastically degrades mechanical properties report synthesis injectable nonswellable hydrogels hydrophilic thermoresponsive polymers two independently occurring effects swelling shrinking oppose hydrogels can endure compressive stress megapascals can stretched sevenfold without hysteresis results demonstrate suppression swelling helps retain mechanical properties hydrogels physiological conditions
