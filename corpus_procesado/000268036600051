genome-wide rnai screen identifies genes involved intestinal pathogenic bacterial infection
innate immunity represents first line defense animals report genome-wide vivo drosophila rna interference screen uncover genes involved susceptibility resistance intestinal infection bacterium serratia marcescens first employed whole-organism gene suppression followed tissue-specific silencing gut epithelium hemocytes identify several hundred genes involved intestinal antibacterial immunity among pathways identified showed jak-stat signaling pathway controls host defense gut regulating stem cell proliferation thus epithelial cell homeostasis therefore revealed multiple genes involved antibacterial defense regulation innate immunity
