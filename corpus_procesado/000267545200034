role terrestrial plants limiting atmospheric co2 decline past million years
environmental conditions past million years thought favourable enhanced rates atmospheric carbon dioxide drawdown silicate chemical weathering- proxy records indicate however earths atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations fall parts per million period stabilization atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations near minimum value suggests strong negative feedback mechanisms inhibited drawdown atmospheric carbon dioxide high rates global silicate rock weathering investigate one possible negative feedback mechanism occurring relatively low carbon dioxide concentrations warm climates related terrestrial plant productivity role decomposition silicate minerals- use simulations terrestrial geochemical carbon cycles available experimental evidence show vegetation activity upland regions active orogens severely limited near-starvation carbon dioxide combination global warmth period conditions diminished biotic-driven silicate rock weathering thereby attenuated important long-term carbon dioxide sink although modelling results semi-quantitative capture full range biogeochemical feedbacks influence climate analysis indicates dynamic equilibrium plants climate geosphere probably buffered minimum atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations past million years
