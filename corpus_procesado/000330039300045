peptide hormone receptor protein kinase regulate plant cell expansion
plant cells immobile thus plant growth development depend cell expansion rather cell migration molecular mechanism plasma membrane initiates changes cell expansion rate remains elusive found secreted peptide ralf rapid alkalinization factor suppresses cell elongation primary root activating cell surface receptor feronia arabidopsis thaliana direct peptide-receptor interaction supported specific binding ralf feronia reduced binding insensitivity ralf-induced growth inhibition feronia mutants phosphoproteome measurements demonstrate ralf-feronia interaction causes phosphorylation plasma membrane h+-adenosine triphosphatase ser mediating inhibition proton transport results reveal molecular mechanism ralf-induced extracellular alkalinization signaling pathway regulates cell expansion
