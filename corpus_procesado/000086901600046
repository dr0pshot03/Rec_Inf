detection doubled shot noise short normal-metal/superconductor junctions
shot noise refers fluctuations electrical current device arising discrete nature charge-carrying particles recent experiments exploited fact shot noise proportional charge carriers establish fractional quantization quasiparticles fractional quantum hall effect similar argument expected superconducting reservoir emits cooper pairs charge twice electron short normal-metal wire shot noise double obtained normal-metal reservoir although charge cooper pairs well established flux quantization tunnel experiments doubling shot noise yet observed report shot-noise experiment using short diffusive normal-metal superconductor contact confirm predicted noise behaviour double charges measurements taken large range bias current establish phase coherence required observe effect
