convergent evolution insect mammalian audition
mammals hearing dependent three canonical processing stages: eardrum collecting sound ii middle ear impedance converter iii cochlear frequency analyzer show insects rainforest katydids possess equivalent biophysical mechanisms auditory processing although katydid ears among smallest organisms ears perform crucial stage air-to-liquid impedance conversion signal amplification use distinct tympanal lever system along chain hearing spectral sound analysis achieved dispersive wave propagation across fluid substrate mammalian cochlea thus two phylogenetically remote organisms katydids mammals evolved series convergent solutions common biophysical problems despite reliance different morphological substrates
