centrosomal localization signal cyclin e required cdk2-independent s phase entry
excess cyclin e-cdk2 accelerates entry s phase cell cycle promotes polyploidy may contribute genomic instability cancer cells identified amino acids cyclin e centrosomal localization signal cls essential centrosomal targeting promoting dna synthesis expressed wild-type mutant cls peptides localized centrosome prevented endogenous cyclin e cyclin localizing centrosome inhibited dna synthesis ectopic cyclin e localized centrosome accelerated s phase entry even mutations abolish cdk2 binding mutation cls results suggest cyclin e modular centrosomal-targeting domain essential promoting s phase entry cdk2-independent manner
