transcriptional landscape yeast genome defined rna sequencing 
identification untranslated regions introns coding regions within organism remains challenging developed quantitative sequencing based method called rna seq mapping transcribed regions complementary dna fragments subjected high throughput sequencing mapped genome applied rna seq generate high resolution transcriptome map yeast genome demonstrated % nonrepetitive sequence yeast genome transcribed confirmed many known predicted introns demonstrated others actively used alternative initiation codons upstream open reading frames also identified many yeast genes also found unexpected end heterogeneity presence many overlapping genes results indicate yeast transcriptome complex previously appreciated
