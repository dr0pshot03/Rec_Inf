turnover sex chromosomes induced sexual conflict
sex-determination genes among fluid features genome many groups animals taxa master sex-determining gene moves frequently chromosomes whereas taxa different genes recruited determine sex zygotes well developed theory origin stable highly dimorphic sex chromosomes seen groups eutherian mammals contrast evolutionary lability genetic sex determination groups remains largely unexplained theoretical study show autosomal gene sexually antagonistic selection can cause spread new sex-determining gene linked mechanism can account origin new sex-determining loci transposition ancestral sex-determining gene autosome maintenance multiple sex-determining factors species lack heteromorphic sex chromosomes
