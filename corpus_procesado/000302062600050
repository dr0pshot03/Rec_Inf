hnrnp c tetramer measures rna length classify rna polymerase ii transcripts export
specific rna recognition usually achieved specific rna sequences and/or structures however show mechanism rna polymerase ii pol ii transcripts classified according length heterotetramer heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein hnrnp c1/c2 measures length transcripts like molecular ruler selectively binding unstructured rna regions longer nucleotides thus tetramer sorts transcripts two rna categories exported either messenger rna uridine-rich small nuclear rna u snrna depending whether longer threshold respectively findings reveal new function c tetramer highlight biological importance rna recognition length
