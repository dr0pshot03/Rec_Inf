enforcement temporal fidelity pyramidal cells somatic feed-forward inhibition
temporal resolution neuronal integration depends time window within excitatory inputs summate reach threshold spike generation show rat hippocampal pyramidal cells window narrow less milliseconds narrowness results short delay disynaptic feed-forward inhibition follows monosynaptic excitation simultaneous somatic dendritic recordings indicate feedforward inhibition much stronger soma dendrites resulting broader integration window latter compartment thus subcellular partitioning feed-forward inhibition enforces precise coincidence detection soma allowing dendrites sum incoming activity broader time windows
