sporadic immunogenic tumours avoid destruction inducing t-cell tolerance
recognition elimination tumours t cells process termed cancer immunosurveillance effective certain virus-associated cancers spontaneous tumours often induce specific immune response therefore also immunogenic however clear whether can controlled t cells- immunosurveillance hypothesis postulates tumours eventually grow escaped t-cell recognition losing immunogenicity- show generating mouse model sporadic cancer based rare spontaneous activation dormant oncogene immunogenic tumours escape recognition induce tolerance model tumours derive single cells express tumour-specific transplantation rejection antigen whereas vaccinated mice remain tumour-free throughout lifetime naive mice always develop progressively growing tumour also show despite specific recognition t cells tumours lose intrinsic immunogenicity rejected transplantation t-cell-competent recipients furthermore primary host tumour-induced tolerance associated expansion non-functional t cells together data argue immunosurveillance spontaneous cancer
