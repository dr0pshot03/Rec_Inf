morphs dispersal behavior genetic similarity evolution cooperation
genetic similarity owing kin relationship often invoked explain evolution social cooperation study male color morphs side-blotched lizards settle nonrandomly respect genetic similarity blue morphs tend settle close proximity blue morphs high genetic similarity blue neighbors three times average fitness blue males lacking neighbors conversely genetically similar males depress fitness orange morph moreover orange males hyperdispersed respect genetic similarity pedigree dispersal data show genetically similar blue neighbors kin instead conditions evolution dispersal cooperation promoted emergent property morph locus increases genetic similarity within morphs: genome-wide correlational selection links many traits morph locus including settlement behavior
