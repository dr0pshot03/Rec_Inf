giant stream metal-rich stars halo galaxy m31 
recent observations revealed streams gas stars halo milky way- debris interactions galaxy dwarf companion galaxies sagittarius dwarf galaxy magellanic clouds analysis material shown much halo made cannibalized satellite galaxies dark matter distributed nearly spherically milky way remains unclear however whether cannibalized substructures common haloes galaxies predicted galaxy-formation theory report discovery giant stream metal-rich stars within halo nearest large galaxy m31 andromeda galaxy source stream dwarf galaxies m32 ngc205 close companions m31 may lost substantial number stars owing tidal interactions results demonstrate epoch galaxy building still continues albeit modest rate tidal streams may generic feature galaxy haloes
