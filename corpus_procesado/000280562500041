regulation myeloid leukaemia cell-fate determinant musashi
chronic myelogenous leukaemia cml can progress slow growing chronic phase aggressive blast crisis phase molecular basis transition remains poorly understood used mouse models cml show disease progression regulated musashi-numb signalling axis specifically find chronic phase marked high levels numb expression whereas blast crisis phase low levels numb expression ectopic expression numb promotes differentiation impairs advanced-phase disease vivo possible explanation decreased levels numb blast crisis phase show nup98-hoxa9 oncogene associated blast crisis cml can trigger expression rna-binding protein musashi2 msi2 turn represses numb notably loss msi2 restores numb expression significantly impairs development propagation blast crisis cml vitro vivo finally show msi2 expression highly upregulated human cml progression also early indicator poorer prognosis data show musashi-numb pathway can control differentiation cml cells raise possibility targeting pathway may provide new strategy therapy aggressive leukaemias
