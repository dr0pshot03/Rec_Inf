dipole moments highly vibrationally excited water 
intensity water absorption region solar spectrum plays dominant role atmospheric energy balance hence strongly influences climate significant controversy exists model absorption accurately report dipole moment measurements highly vibrationally excited water provide stringent tests intensities determined means measurements accompanying calculations suggest best currently available potential dipole surfaces accurately model intensities optical spectrum water
