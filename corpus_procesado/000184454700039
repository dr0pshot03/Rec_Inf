measuring fast neutrons hiroshima distances relevant atomic-bomb survivors
data survivors atomic bombs serve major basis risk calculations radiation-induced cancer humans controversy existed almost two decades however concerning possibility neutron doses hiroshima may much larger estimated controversy based measurements radioisotopes activated thermal neutrons suggested much higher fluences larger distances expected- fast neutrons contributed almost neutron dose clear measurement validation far proved impossible large distances m relevant survivor locations first results reported detection ni produced predominantly fast neutrons mev copper samples hiroshima breakthrough made possible development chemical extraction methods major improvements sensitivity accelerator mass spectrometry detection ni atoms refs results compared ni activation predicted neutron doses hiroshima survivors good agreement observed distances relevant survivor data findings provide first time clear measurement validation neutron doses survivors hiroshima
