roles mating environment c elegans sex determination 
caenorhabditis elegans two sexes hermaphrodites males thought irreversibly determined fertilization ratio x chromosomes sets autosomes: xx embryos develop hermaphrodites xo embryos males show instead sex genotype c elegans can altered postembryonically exibility requires sexual reproduction grown specific bacterial metabolites xx larvae generated mating males hermaphrodites develop males lose one x chromosome however xx larvae produced hermaphrodite self-fertilization show changes propose sexual reproduction increases developmental exibility progeny allowing better adaptation changing environments
