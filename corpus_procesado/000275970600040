efficient annealing radiation damage near grain boundaries via interstitial emission 
although grain boundaries can serve effective sinks radiation-induced defects interstitials vacancies atomistic mechanisms leading enhanced tolerance still well understood use three atomistic simulation methods investigated defect-grain boundary interaction mechanisms copper picosecond microsecond time scales found grain boundaries surprising loading-unloading effect upon irradiation interstitials loaded boundary acts source emitting interstitials annihilate vacancies bulk unexpected recombination mechanism much lower energy barrier conventional vacancy diffusion efficient annihilating immobile vacancies nearby bulk resulting self-healing radiation-induced damage
