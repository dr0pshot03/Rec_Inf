design evolution new catalytic activity existing protein scaffold
design enzymes new functions properties long goal protein engineering report strategy change catalytic activity existing protein scaffold achieved simultaneous incorporation adjustment functional elements insertion deletion substitution several active site loops followed point mutations fine-tune activity using approach able introduce beta-lactamase activity alpha beta/beta alpha metallohydrolase scaffold glyoxalase ii resulting enzyme evmbl8 evolved metallo beta-lactamase completely lost original activity instead catalyzed hydrolysis cefotaxime kcat/k-mapp x mole/titer- second- thus increasing resistance escherichia coli growth cefotaxime factor
