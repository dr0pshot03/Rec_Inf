blockade dll4 inhibits tumour growth promoting non-productive angiogenesis
tumour growth requires accompanying expansion host vasculature tumour progression often correlated vascular density vascular endothelial growth factor vegf best-characterized inducer tumour angiogenesis report vegf dynamically regulates tumour endothelial expression delta-like ligand dll4 previously shown absolutely required normal embryonic vascular development define dll4 function tumour angiogenesis manipulated pathway murine tumour models using several approaches show blockade resulted markedly increased tumour vascularity associated enhanced angiogenic sprouting branching paradoxically increased vascularity non-productive shown poor perfusion increased hypoxia importantly decreased tumour growth even tumours resistant anti-vegf therapy thus vegf-induced dll4 acts negative regulator tumour angiogenesis blockade results striking uncoupling tumour growth vessel density presenting novel therapeutic approach even tumours resistant anti-vegf therapies
