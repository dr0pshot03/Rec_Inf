direct visual observation thermal capillary waves
studied free fluid-fluid interface phase-separated colloid-polymer dispersion laser scanning confocal microscopy directly observed thermally induced capillary waves interface real space experimental results static dynamic correlation functions validate capillary wave model almost particle level ultralow interfacial tension capillary length capillary time found agreement independent measurements furthermore show capillary waves induce spontaneous breakup thin liquid films thus key importance process droplet coalescence
