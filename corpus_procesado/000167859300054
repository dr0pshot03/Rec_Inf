crystal structure b7-/ctla- complex inhibits human immune responses 
optimal immune responses require antigen-specific co-stimulatory signal shared ligands b7- b7- antigen-presenting cells deliver co-stimulatory signal cd28 ctla- t cells signalling cd28 augments t-cell response whereas ctla- signalling attenuates numerous animal studies12 recent clinical trials34 indicate manipulating interactions holds considerable promise immunotherapy consequences signals well established details downstream signalling events emerging5- understanding molecular nature extracellular interactions becomes crucial report crystal structure human ctla-/b7- co-stimulatory complex angstrom resolution contrast interacting cell-surface molecules relatively small ctla-/b7- binding interface exhibits unusually high degree shape complementarity ctla- forms homodimers newly defined interface highly conserved residues crystal lattice ctla- b7- pack strikingly periodic arrangement bivalent ctla- homodimers bridge bivalent b7- homodimers zipper-like oligomerization provides structural basis forming unusually stable signalling complexes t-cell surface underscoring importance potent inhibitory signalling human immune responses
