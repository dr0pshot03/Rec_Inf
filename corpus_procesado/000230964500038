measurement conductance single conjugated molecules 
electrical conduction molecules depends critically delocalization molecular electronic orbitals connection metallic contacts thiolated -sh conjugated organic molecules therefore considered good candidates molecular conductors: molecules orbitals delocalized throughout molecular backbone substantial weight sulphur metal bonds- however relatively small size typically similar nm calls innovative approaches realize functioning single-molecule device- report approach contacting single molecule use study effect localizing groups within conjugated molecule electrical conduction method based synthesizing dimer structure consisting two colloidal gold particles connected dithiolated short organic molecule electrostatically trapping two metal electrodes study electrical conduction three short organic molecules: biphenyldithiol bpd fully conjugated molecule bis mercaptophenyl ether bpe conjugation broken centre oxygen atom -benzenedimethanethiol bdmt conjugation broken near contacts methylene group find oxygen bpe methylene groups bdmt suppress electrical conduction relative bpd
