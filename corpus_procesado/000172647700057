negative regulation neural stem/progenitor cell proliferation pten tumor suppressor gene vivo
mechanisms controlling neural stem cell proliferation poorly understood demonstrate pten tumor suppressor plays important role regulating neural stem/progenitor cells vivo vitro mice lacking pten exhibited enlarged histoarchitecturally abnormal brains resulted increased cell proliferation decreased cell death enlarged cell size neurosphere cultures revealed greater proliferation capacity tripotent pten-/- central nervous system stem/progenitor cells can attributed least part shortened cell cycle however cell fate commitments progenitors largely undisturbed results suggest pten negatively regulates neural stem cell proliferation
