nanoporous bivo4 photoanodes dual-layer oxygen evolution catalysts solar water splitting
bismuth vanadate bivo4 band structure well-suited potential use photoanode solar water splitting suffers poor electron-hole separation demonstrate nanoporous morphology specific surface area square meters per gram effectively suppresses bulk carrier recombination without additional doping manifesting electron-hole separation yield volts v versus reversible hydrogen electrode rhe enhanced propensity surface-reaching holes instigate water-splitting chemistry serially applying two different oxygen evolution catalyst oec layers feooh niooh reduces interface recombination bivo4/oec junction creating favorable helmholtz layer potential drop oec/electrolyte junction resulting bivo4/feooh/niooh photoanode achieves photocurrent density milliamps per square centimenter potential low v versus rhe
