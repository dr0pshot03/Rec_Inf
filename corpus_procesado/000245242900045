magnetic exchange force microscopy atomic resolution
ordering neighbouring atomic magnetic moments spins leads important collective phenomena ferromagnetism antiferromagnetism full understanding magnetism nanometre scale therefore calls information arrangement spins real space atomic resolution spin-polarized scanning tunnelling microscopy accomplishes can probe conducting materials force microscopy can used sample independent conductivity particular magnetic force microscopy well suited exploring ferromagnetic domain structures however atomic resolution achieved data acquisition involves sensing long-range magnetostatic forces tip sample magnetic exchange force microscopy proposed overcoming limitation: using atomic force microscope magnetic tip possible detect short-range magnetic exchange force tip sample spins show prototypical antiferromagnetic insulator surface nickel oxide magnetic exchange force microscopy can indeed reveal arrangement surface atoms spins simultaneously contrast previous attempts implement method- use external magnetic field align magnetic polarization tip apex optimize interaction tip sample spins allows us observe direct magnetic exchange coupling spins tip atom sample atom closest thereby demonstrate potential magnetic exchange force microscopy investigations inter-spin interactions atomic level
