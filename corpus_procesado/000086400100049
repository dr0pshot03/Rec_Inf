functional hydrogel structures autonomous flow control inside microfluidic channels 
hydrogels developed respond wide variety stimuli1- use macroscopic systems hindered slow response times diffusion rate-limiting factor governing swelling process however many natural examples chemically driven actuation rely short diffusion paths produce rapid response7 therefore expected scaling hydrogel objects micrometre scale greatly improve response times scales stimuli-responsive hydrogels enhance capabilities microfluidic systems allowing self-regulated flow control report fabrication active hydrogel components inside microchannels via direct photopatterning liquid phase approach greatly simplifies system construction assembly functional components fabricated situ stimuli-responsive hydrogel components perform sensing actuation functions demonstrate significantly improved response times less seconds hydrogel valves capable autonomous control local flow
