quantum deconstruction infrared spectrum ch5+ 
present two quantum calculations infrared spectrum protonated methane ch5+ using fult-dimensional ab initio-based potential energy dipole moment surfaces calculated spectra compare well tow-resolution experimental spectrum except cm- experimental spectrum shows absorption present calculations find substantial absorption features cm- qualitative agreement earlier classical calculations spectrum major spectral bands analyzed terms molecular motions particular interest intense feature cm- due isomerization mode connects two equivalent minima recent high-resolution jet-cooled spectra ch stretch region cm- also reported assignments band origins made based present quantum calculations
