structure asteroid vesta revealed models planet-scale collisions
asteroid vesta seems major intact protoplanet surface composition similar hed howardite-eucrite-diogenite meteorites- southern hemisphere dominated giant impact scar previous impact models- failed reproduce observed topography recent discovery vestas southern hemisphere dominated two overlapping basins provides opportunity model vestas topography accurately report three-dimensional simulations vestas global evolution two overlapping planet-scale collisions closely reproduce observed shape provide maps impact excavation ejecta deposition spiral patterns observed younger basin rheasilvia one billion years old attributed coriolis forces crater collapse surface materials exposed north come depth kilometres according models whereas materials exposed inside southern double-excavation come depths kilometres vesta began layered completely differentiated protoplanet model predicts large areas pure diogenites olivine-rich rocks seen- possibly implying outer kilometres vesta composed mainly basaltic crust eucrites ultramafic intrusions diogenites
