apoptotic force tissue dynamics drosophila embryogenesis 
understanding cell morphogenesis metazoan development requires knowledge cells extracellular matrix produce respond forces investigated apoptosis remodels tissue eliminating supernumerary cells also contributes forces tissue amnioserosa promotes cell sheet fusion dorsal closure drosophila embryo showed expression amnioserosa proteins suppress enhance apoptosis slows speeds dorsal closure respectively changes correlate forces produced amnioserosa rate seam formation cell sheets zipping key processes contribute closure apoptotic force used embryo drive cell sheet movements development role classically attributed apoptosis
