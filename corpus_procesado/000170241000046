stereotyped position local synaptic targets neocortex
microcircuitry mammalian neocortex remains largely unknown although neocortex composed scores precise circuits alternative possibility local connectivity probabilistic even random examine precision degree determinism neocortical microcircuitry used optical probing reconstruct microcircuits layer mouse primary visual cortex stimulated trigger cells isolated homogenous population corticotectal pyramidal neurons white optically detecting follower neurons directly driven triggers followers belonged selective anatomical classes stereotyped physiological synaptic responses moreover even position followers appeared determined across animals data reveal precisely organized cortical microcircuits
