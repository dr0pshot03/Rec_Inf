differential representation perception action frontal cortex 
motor illusion created separate human subjects perception arm movement actual movement figure drawing trajectories constructed cortical activity recorded monkeys performing task showed actual movement represented primary motor cortex whereas visualized presumably perceived trajectories found ventral premotor cortex perception action representations can differentially recognized brain may contained separate structures
