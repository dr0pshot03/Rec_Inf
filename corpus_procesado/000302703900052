mirna-mediated gene silencing translational repression followed mrna deadenylation decay
micrornas mirnas regulate gene expression translational repression and/or messenger rna mrna deadenylation decay translation deadenylation decay closely linked processes important establish ordering thus define molecular mechanism silencing investigated kinetics events mirna-mediated gene silencing using drosophila s2 cell-based controllable expression system show mrnas natural engineered untranslated regions mirna target sites first subject translational inhibition followed effects deadenylation decay next used natural translational elongation stall show mirna-mediated silencing inhibits translation early step potentially translation initiation
