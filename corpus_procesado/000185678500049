thalamic control visceral nociception mediated t-type ca2+ channels 
sensations viscera like fullness easily become painful stimulus persists mice lacking alpha1gt-typeca2+ channels show hyperalgesia visceral pain thalamic infusion t-type blocker induced similar hyperalgesia wild-type mice response visceral pain ventroposterolateral thalamic neurons evoked surge single spikes slowly decayed t type-dependent burst spikes gradually increased alpha1g-deficient neurons single-spike response persisted without burst spikes results indicate t-type ca2+ channels underlie antinociceptive mechanism operating thalamus support idea burst ring plays critical role sensory gating thalamus
