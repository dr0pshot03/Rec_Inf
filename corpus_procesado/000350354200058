human higher cognition attributed evolutionary expansion elaboration human cerebral cortex however genetic mechanisms contributing developmental changes poorly understood used comparative epigenetic profiling human rhesus macaque mouse corticogenesis identify promoters enhancers gained activity humans gains significantly enriched modules coexpressed genes cortex function neuronal proliferation migration cortical-map organization gain-enriched modules also showed correlated gene expression patterns similar transcription factor binding site enrichments promoters enhancers suggesting connected common regulatory mechanisms results reveal coordinated patterns potential regulatory changes associated conserved developmental processes corticogenesis providing insight human cortical evolution
