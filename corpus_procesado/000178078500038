physical one-way functions 
modern cryptographic practice rests use one-way functions easy evaluate difficult invert unfortunately commonly used one-way functions either based unproven conjectures known vulnerabilities show instead relying number theory mesoscopic physics coherent transport disordered medium can used allocate authenticate unique identifiers physically reducing mediums microstructure fixed-length string binary digits physical one-way functions inexpensive fabricate prohibitively difficult duplicate admit compact mathematical representation intrinsically tamper-resistant provide authentication protocol based enormous address space principal characteristic physical one-way functions
