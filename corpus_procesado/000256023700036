random walk stochastic process particles waves travel along random trajectories first application random walk description particle motion fluid brownian motion now central concept statistical physics describing transport phenomena heat sound light diffusion levy flights particular class generalized random walk step lengths walk described heavy-tailed probability distribution can describe stochastic processes scale invariant levy flights accordingly turned applicable diverse range fields describing animal foraging patterns distribution human travel even aspects earthquake behaviour transport based levy flights extensively studied numerically- experimental work limited date seemed possible observe study levy transport actual materials example experimental work heat sound light diffusion generally limited normal brownian diffusion show possible engineer optical material light waves perform levy flight key parameters determine transport behaviour can easily tuned making ideal experimental system study levy flights controlled way development material diffusive transport light governed levy statistics might even permit development new optical functionalities go beyond normal light diffusion
