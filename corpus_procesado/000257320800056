spread ras activity triggered activation single dendritic spine 
neurons individual dendritic spines isolate n methyl d aspartate nmda receptor mediated calcium ion ca2+ accumulations dendrite spines however extent spines compartmentalize signaling events downstream ca2+ influx known combined two photon fluorescence lifetime imaging two photon glutamate uncaging image activity small guanosine triphosphatase ras nmda receptor activation individual spines induction long term potentiation ltp triggered robust ca2+ dependent ras activation single spines decayed similar minutes ras activity spread similar micrometers dendrite invaded neighboring spines diffusion spread ras dependent signaling necessary local regulation threshold ltp induction thus ca2+ dependent synaptic signals can spread couple multiple synapses short stretches dendrite
