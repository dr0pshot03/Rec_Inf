abortive initiation productive initiation rna polymerase involve dna scrunching
using single-molecule dna nanomanipulation show abortive initiation involves dna scrunching rna polymerase rnap remains stationary unwinds pulls downstream dna scrunching requires rna synthesis depends rna length show promoter escape involves scrunching scrunching occurs instances promoter escape results support existence obligatory stressed intermediate approximately one turn additional dna unwinding escape consistent proposal stress intermediate provides driving force break rnap-promoter rnap-initiation-factor interactions escape
