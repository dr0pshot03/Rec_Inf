pi pi electronic order iron arsenide superconductors 
distribution valence electrons metals usually follows symmetry underlying ionic lattice modulations distribution often occur electrons stable respect new electronic order spin charge density waves electron density waves observed many families superconductors- often considered essential superconductivity exist recent measurements- seem show properties iron pnictides good agreement band structure calculations include additional ordering implying relation density waves superconductivity materials- report electronic structure ba-xkxfeas sharp disagreement band structure calculations- instead reveals reconstruction characterized pi pi wavevector electronic order coexists superconductivity persists room temperature k
