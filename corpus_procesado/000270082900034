seismic evidence loss stellar angular momentum white-dwarf stage 
white-dwarf stars represent final products evolution % stars1 stars keep angular momentum throughout evolution white-dwarf descendants owing compact nature rotate relatively rapidly typical periods order seconds observations photospheres show contrast rotate much slowly periods ranging hours tens years2- known however whether white dwarf hide original angular momentum superficial layers perhaps spinning much rapidly inside surface report determination internal rotation profile white dwarf using method based asteroseismology show pulsating white dwarf pg - rotates solid body encompassing % mass relatively long period +/ h implies lost essentially angular momentum thus favouring theories suggest important angular momentum transfer loss evolutionary phases white-dwarf stage67
