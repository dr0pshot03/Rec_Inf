regulation fasted blood glucose resistin 
association obesity diabetes supports endocrine role adipocyte maintaining glucose homeostasis report mice lacking adipocyte hormone resistin exhibit low blood glucose levels fasting due reduced hepatic glucose production partly mediated activation adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase decreased expression gluconeogenic enzymes liver data thus support physiological function resistin maintenance blood glucose fasting remarkably lack resistin diminishes increase post-fast blood glucose normally associated increased weight suggesting role resistin mediating hyperglycemia associated obesity
