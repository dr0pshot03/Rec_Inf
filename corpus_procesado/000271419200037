long aftershock sequences within continents implications earthquake hazard assessment
one powerful features plate tectonics known plate motions give insight locations average recurrence interval future large earthquakes plate boundaries plate tectonics gives insight however earthquakes will occur within plates interiors ideal plates deform result within plate interiors assessments earthquake hazards rely heavily assumption locations small earthquakes shown short historical record reflect continuing deformation will cause future large earthquakes however show many recent earthquakes probably aftershocks large earthquakes occurred hundreds years ago present simple model predicting length aftershock sequences varies inversely rate faults loaded aftershock sequences within slowly deforming continents predicted significantly longer decade typically observed rapidly loaded plate boundaries predictions accord observations common practice treating continental earthquakes steady-state seismicity overestimates hazard presently active areas underestimates elsewhere
