angular fluctuations multicomponent order describe pseudogap yba2cu3o6+x 
hole-doped cuprate high-temperature superconductors enter pseudogap regime superconducting critical temperature t-c falls decreasing hole density recent x-ray scattering experiments yba2cu3o6+x observe incommensurate charge-density wave fluctuations whose strength rises gradually wide temperature range t-c decreases temperature lowered t-c propose theory superconducting charge-density wave orders exhibit angular fluctuations six-dimensional space theory provides natural quantitative fit x-ray data can basis understanding characteristics pseudogap
