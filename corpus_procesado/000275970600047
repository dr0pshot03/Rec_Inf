beta-adrenergic receptor redistribution heart failure changes camp compartmentation 
beta beta-adrenergic receptors beta ars surface cardiomyocytes mediate distinct effects cardiac function development heart failure regulating production second messenger cyclic adenosine monophosphate camp spatial localization cardiomyocytes bars coupled heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding proteins g proteins functional implications localization unclear combined nanoscale live-cell scanning ion conductance fluorescence resonance energy transfer microscopy techniques found cardiomyocytes healthy adult rats mice spatially confined betaar-induced camp signals localized exclusively deep transverse tubules whereas functional betaars distributed across entire cell surface cardiomyocytes derived rat model chronic heart failure betaars redistributed transverse tubules cell crest led diffuse receptor-mediated camp signaling thus redistribution betaars heart failure changes compartmentation camp might contribute failing myocardial phenotype
