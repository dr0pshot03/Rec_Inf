tunable supercurrent semiconductor nanowires 
nanoscale superconductor/semiconductor hybrid devices assembled indium arsenide semiconductor nanowires individually contacted aluminum-based superconductor electrodes kelvin high transparency contacts gives rise proximity-induced superconductivity nanowires form superconducting weak links operating mesoscopic josephson junctions electrically tunable coupling supercurrent can switched on/off gate voltage acting electron density nanowire variation gate voltage induces universal fluctuations normal-state conductance clearly correlated critical current fluctuations alternating-current josephson effect gives rise shapiro steps voltage-current characteristic microwave irradiation
