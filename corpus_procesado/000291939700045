flying flock comes cost pigeons 
flying birds often form flocks social navigational antipredator implications flying flock can result aerodynamic benefits thus reducing power requirements demonstrated reduction heart rate wingbeat frequency pelicans flying v-formation general aerodynamic power reduction due group-flight v-formation flocks limited moderately steady flight relatively large birds may represent special case aerodynamic consequences flying usual cluster flock use data innovative back-mounted global positioning system gps degrees-of-freedom inertial sensors show pigeons maintain powered banked turns like aircraft imposing dorsal accelerations 2g effectively doubling body weight quadrupling induced power requirements increase flap frequency increases conventional aerodynamic power requirements increase flap frequency flying near particularly behind birds therefore unlike v-formation pelicans pigeons gain aerodynamic advantage flying flock indeed increased flap frequency whether due direct aerodynamic interactions requirements increased stability control suggests considerable energetic cost flight tight cluster flock
