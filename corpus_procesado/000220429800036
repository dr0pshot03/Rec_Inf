quantum optimally controlled transition landscapes
large number experimental studies simulations show surprisingly easy find excellent quality control broad classes quantum systems now prove controllable quantum systems constraints placed controls allowed extrema transition probability landscape correspond perfect control control conditions suboptimal local extrema exist traps impede search optimal control identified landscape structure universal controllable quantum systems dimension seeking maximize transition probability regardless detailed nature system hamiltonian presence weak control field noise environmental decoherence shown preserve general structure control landscape lower resolution
