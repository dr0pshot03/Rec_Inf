microrna governs neuronal excitability motor behavior mice
control motor behavior animals humans requires constant adaptation neuronal networks signals various types strengths found microrna mir- expressed adult neurons regulates motor behavior modulating neuronal signaling networks excitability mir governs motor activity suppressing expression various ion channels signaling components extracellular signal-regulated kinase erk2 network regulate neuronal excitability mice reduction mir expression postnatal neurons causes increased motor activity fatal epilepsy overexpression mir attenuates neuronal responsiveness suppresses motor activity alleviates motor abnormalities associated parkinsons-like disease seizures mice data suggest therapeutic potential mir treatment epilepsy movement disorders
