screening noise gene expression identifies drug synergies 
stochastic fluctuations inherent gene expression can drive cell-fate specification used fluctuations modulate reactivation hiv latency-a quiescent state major barrier hiv cure screening diverse library bioactive small molecules identified compounds modulated hiv gene-expression fluctuations ie noise without changing mean expression noise-modulating compounds neglected conventional screens yet synergized conventional transcriptional activators noise enhancers reactivated latent cells significantly better existing best-in-class reactivation drug combinations reduced off-target cytotoxicity whereas noise suppressors stabilized latency noise-modulating chemicals may provide novel probes physiological consequences noise unexplored axis drug discovery allowing enhanced control diverse cell-fate decisions
