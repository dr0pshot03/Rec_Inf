transnuclear mice predefined t cell receptor specificities toxoplasma gondii obtained via scnt 
mice transgenic rearranged antigen-specific t cell receptors tcrs essential tools study t cell development function tcrs usually isolated relevant t cells long-term culture often repeated antigen stimulation unavoidably skews t cell population used random genomic integration tcr alpha beta chain expression nonendogenous promoters represent additional drawbacks transgenics using epigenetic reprogramming via somatic cell nuclear transfer demonstrated t cells predefined specificities toxoplasma gondii can used generate mouse models express tcr endogenous loci without experimentally introduced genetic modification relative ease speed transnuclear models can obtained holds promise construction disease models
