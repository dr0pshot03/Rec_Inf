nucleus structure activity comet 67p/churyumov-gerasimenko 
images osiris scientific imaging system onboard rosetta show nucleus 67p/churyumov-gerasimenko consists two lobes connected short neck nucleus bulk density less half water activity distance sun > astronomical units predominantly neck jets seen consistently nucleus rotates principal axis momentum surface morphology suggests removal larger volumes material possibly via explosive release subsurface pressure via creation overhangs sublimation may major mass loss process shape raises question whether two lobes represent contact binary formed billion years ago single body gap evolved via mass loss
