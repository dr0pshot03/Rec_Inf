solid ammonium sulfate aerosols ice nuclei: pathway cirrus cloud formation 
laboratory measurements support cirrus cloud formation pathway involving heterogeneous ice nucleation solid ammonium sulfate aerosols ice formation occurs low ice-saturation ratios consistent formation continental cirrus interhemispheric asymmetry observed cloud onset climate model mechanism provides widespread source ice nuclei leads fewer larger ice crystals compared homogeneous freezing scenario reduces cloud albedo longwave heating cirrus global ammonia budget dominated agricultural practices pathway might couple anthropogenic activity climate system
