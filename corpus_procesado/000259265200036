intrinsic mechanism corticogenesis embryonic stem cells 
cerebral cortex develops coordinated generation dozens neuronal subtypes mechanisms involved remain unclear show mouse embryonic stem cells cultured without morphogen presence sonic hedgehog inhibitor recapitulate vitro major milestones cortical development leading sequential generation diverse repertoire neurons display salient features genuine cortical pyramidal neurons grafted cerebral cortex neurons develop patterns axonal projections corresponding wide range cortical layers also highly specific cortical areas particular visual limbic areas thereby demonstrating identity cortical area can specified without influence brain discovery intrinsic corticogenesis sheds new light mechanisms neuronal specification opens new avenues modelling treatment brain diseases
