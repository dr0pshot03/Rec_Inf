molecular architecture assembly principles vibrio cholerae biofilms 
natural environment microbes organize communities held together extracellular matrix composed polysaccharides proteins developed vivo labeling strategy allow extracellular matrix developing biofilms visualized conventional superresolution light microscopy vibrio cholerae biofilms displayed three distinct levels spatial organization: cells clusters cells collections clusters multiresolution imaging living v cholerae biofilms revealed complementary architectural roles four essential matrix constituents: rbma provided cell-cell adhesion bap1 allowed developing biofilm adhere surfaces heterogeneous mixtures vibrio polysaccharide rbmc bap1 formed dynamic flexible ordered envelopes encased cell clusters
