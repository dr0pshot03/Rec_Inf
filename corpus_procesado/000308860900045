sex-specific volatile compounds influence microarthropod-mediated fertilization moss 
sexual reproduction non-vascular plants requires unicellular free-motile sperm travel male female reproductive structures across terrestrial landscape recent data suggest microarthropods can disperse sperm mosses however little known chemical communication involved interaction relative importance microarthropod dispersal compared abiotic dispersal agents mosses show tissues cosmopolitan moss ceratodon purpureus emit complex volatile scents similar chemical diversity described pollination mutualisms flowering plants insects chemical composition c purpureus volatiles sex-specific moss-dwelling microarthropods differentially attracted sex-specific moss volatile cues furthermore using experimental microcosms show microarthropods significantly increase moss fertilization rates even presence water spray highlighting important role microarthropod dispersal contributing moss mating success taken together results indicate presence scent-based plant-pollinator-like relationship evolved two earths ancient terrestrial lineages mosses microarthropods
