reprogramming vivo produces teratomas ips cells totipotency features 
reprogramming adult cells generate induced pluripotent stem cells ips cells opened new therapeutic opportunities; however little known possibility vivo reprogramming within tissues show transitory induction four factors oct4 sox2 klf4 c-myc mice results teratomas emerging multiple organs implying full reprogramming can occur vivo analyses stomach intestine pancreas kidney reveal groups dedifferentiated cells express pluripotency marker nanog indicative situ reprogramming bone marrow transplantation demonstrate haematopoietic cells can also reprogrammed vivo notably reprogrammable mice present circulating ips cells blood transcriptome level vivo generated ips cells closer embryonic stem cells es cells standard vitro generated ips cells moreover vivo ips cells efficiently contribute trophectoderm lineage suggesting achieve plastic primitive state es cells finally intraperitoneal injection vivo ips cells generates embryo-like structures express embryonic extraembryonic markers conclude reprogramming vivo feasible confers totipotency features absent standard ips es cells discoveries relevant future applications reprogramming regenerative medicine
