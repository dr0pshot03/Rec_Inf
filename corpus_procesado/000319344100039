accurate geometric distance compact binary ss cygni vindicates accretion disc theory
dwarf novae white dwarfs accreting matter nearby red dwarf companion regular outbursts explained thermal-viscous instability accretion disc described disc instability model since successfully extended accreting systems however prototypical dwarf nova ss cygni presents major challenge understanding accretion disc theory distance +/ parsecs measured hubble space telescope luminous undergoing observed regular outbursts using long baseline interferometric radio observations report accurate model-independent distance ss cygni places source substantially closer +/ parsecs reconciles source behavior understanding accretion disc theory accreting compact objects
