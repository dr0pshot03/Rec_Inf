phosphorylation retinoblastoma protein viral protein cyclin-dependent kinase function 
obligate intracellular parasites viruses expertly modify cellular processes facilitate replication spread often encoding genes mimic functions cellular proteins lacking regulatory features modify activity show human cytomegalovirus ul97 protein activities similar cellular cyclin cyclin dependent kinase cdk complexes ul97 phosphorylated inactivated retinoblastoma tumor suppressor stimulated cell cycle progression mammalian cells rescued proliferation saccharomyces cerevisiae lacking cdk activity ul97 inhibited cdk inhibitor p21 lacks amino acid residues conserved cdks permit attenuation kinase activity thus ul97 represents functional ortholog cellular cdks immune normal cdk control mechanisms
