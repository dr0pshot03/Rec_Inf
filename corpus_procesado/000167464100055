regulation cd40 cd40 ligand at-hook transcription factor akna
proteins containing hooks bind a/t-rich dna nine-amino-acid motif thought co-regulate transcription modifying architecture dna thereby enhancing accessibility promoters transcription factors describe akna human at-hook protein directly binds a/t-rich regulatory elements promoters cd40 cd40 ligand cd40l coordinately regulates expression consistent function akna nuclear protein contains multiple pest protein-cleavage motifs common regulatory proteins high turnover rates akna mainly expressed b t lymphocytes natural killer cells dendritic cells b-lymphocyte differentiation akna mainly expressed germinal centre b lymphocytes stage receptor ligand interactions crucial b-lymphocyte maturation- findings show at-hook molecule can coordinately regulate expression key receptor ligand point towards molecular mechanism explains homotypic cell interactions
