quantum structure intermolecular proton bond
proton shared two closed-shell molecules [a h+ b] constitutes ubiquitous soft binding motif biological processes vibrational transitions associated shared proton provide direct probe interaction extensively studied condensed phase yielded limited detailed information diffuse character exploited recent advances gas-phase ion spectroscopy identify sharp spectral features can assigned shared proton two tethered molecules survey cold isolated [ h+ b] ions data yield picture intermolecular proton bond microscopic scale facilitating analysis properties within context floppy polyatomic molecule
