observation o- molecular lattice epsilon phase solid oxygen 
simple diatomic molecules oxygen one carry magnetic moment makes solid oxygen particularly interesting: considered spin-controlled crystal1 displays unusual magnetic order2 high pressures solid oxygen changes insulating metallic state3; low temperatures even transforms superconducting state4 structural investigations solid oxygen began 1920s present six distinct crystallographic phases established unambiguously1 phase solid oxygen particularly intriguing: exhibits dark-red colour strong infrared absorption magnetic collapse1 also stable large pressure domain subject numerous x-ray diffraction5- spectroscopic8- theoretical studies12- although epsilon-oxygen shown monoclinic c2/m symmetry5- infrared absorption behaviour attributed association oxygen molecules larger units914 exact structure remains unknown use single-crystal x-ray diffraction data collected gpa determine structure epsilon-oxygen find epsilon-oxygen characterized association four o- molecules rhombohedral molecular unit held together probably weak chemical bonds structure consistent existing spectroscopic data validated observation newly predicted raman stretching mode
