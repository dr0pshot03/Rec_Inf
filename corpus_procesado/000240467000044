observation o molecular lattice epsilon phase solid oxygen 
simple diatomic molecules oxygen one carry magnetic moment makes solid oxygen particularly interesting: considered spin-controlled crystal displays unusual magnetic order high pressures solid oxygen changes insulating metallic state low temperatures even transforms superconducting state structural investigations solid oxygen began 1920s present six distinct crystallographic phases established unambiguously phase solid oxygen particularly intriguing: exhibits dark-red colour strong infrared absorption magnetic collapse also stable large pressure domain subject numerous x-ray diffraction- spectroscopic- theoretical studies- although epsilon-oxygen shown monoclinic c2/m symmetry- infrared absorption behaviour attributed association oxygen molecules larger units exact structure remains unknown use single-crystal x-ray diffraction data collected gpa determine structure epsilon-oxygen find epsilon-oxygen characterized association four o molecules rhombohedral molecular unit held together probably weak chemical bonds structure consistent existing spectroscopic data validated observation newly predicted raman stretching mode
