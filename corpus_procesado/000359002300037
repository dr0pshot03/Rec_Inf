deciphering neural circuits anatomically organized regard input output instrumental understanding brain processes information example locus coeruleus noradrenaline also known norepinephrine lc-ne neurons receive input send output broad regions brain spinal cord regulate diverse functions including arousal attention mood sensory gating- however unclear lc-ne neurons divide brain-wide projection patterns whether different lc-ne neurons receive differential input developed set viral-genetic tools quantitatively analyse input-output relationship neural circuits applied tools dissect lc-ne circuit mice rabies-virus-based input mapping indicated lc-ne neurons receive convergent synaptic input many regions previously identified sending axons locus coeruleus well newly identified presynaptic partners including cerebellar purkinje cells tracing relationship input output method trio method enables trans-synaptic input tracing specific subsets neurons based projection cell type found lc-ne neurons projecting diverse output regions receive mostly similar input projection-based viral labelling revealed lc-ne neurons projecting one output region also project brain regions examined thus lc-ne circuit overall integrates information broadcasts many brain regions consistent primary role regulating brain states time uncovered several levels specificity certain lc-ne sub-circuits tools mapping output architecture input-output relationship applicable neuronal circuits organisms broadly viral-genetic approaches provide efficient intersectional means target neuronal populations based cell type projection pattern
