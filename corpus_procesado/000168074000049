g protein beta gamma subunit-mediated presynaptic inhibition: regulation exocytotic fusion downstream ca2+ entry
nervous system can modulate neurotransmitter release neurotransmitter activation heterotrimeric gtp-binding protein g protein-coupled receptors found microinjection g protein beta gamma subunits g beta gamma mimics serotonins inhibitory effect neurotransmission release free g beta gamma critical effect g beta gamma scavenger blocked serotonins effect g beta gamma bad effect fast action potential-evoked intracellular ca2+ release triggered neurotransmission inhibition neurotransmitter release serotonin still seen blockade classical g beta gamma effector pathways thus g beta gamma blocked neurotransmitter release downstream ca2+ entry may directly target exocytotic fusion machinery presynaptic terminal
