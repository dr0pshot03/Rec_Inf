sequencing nuclear genome extinct woolly mammoth
two independent groups extracted dna several pleistocene epoch mammoths noted differences among individual specimens subsequently dna sequences published number extinct species however ancient dna often fragmented damaged studies date typically focused short mitochondrial sequences never yielding fraction per cent nuclear genome describe billion bases gb sequence several mammoth specimens billion % woolly mammoth mammuthus primigenius genome thus comprise extensive set genome wide sequence extinct species data support earlier reports elephantid genomes exceed gb estimated divergence rate mammoth african elephant half human chimpanzee observed number nucleotide differences two particular mammoths approximately one eighth one african elephant corresponding separation mammoths myr estimated probability orthologous elephant mammoth amino acids differ corresponding one residue per protein differences discovered mammoth african elephant amino acid positions otherwise invariant several billion years combined mammalian evolution study shows nuclear genome sequencing extinct species can reveal population differences evident fossil record perhaps even discover genetic factors affect extinction
