imaging resonances low-energy no-he inelastic collisions 
molecular collisions resonances occur specific energies colliding particles temporarily form quasibound complexes resulting rapid variations energy dependence scattering cross sections experimentally proven challenging observe scattering resonances especially differential cross sections report observation resonance fingerprints state-to-state differential cross sections inelastic no-he collisions centimeter- energy range centimeter- resolution observed structures excellent agreement quantum scattering calculations analyzed separating resonance contributions differential cross sections background partitioning multichannel scattering matrix revealed partial-wave composition resonances evolution collision
