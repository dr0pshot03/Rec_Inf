dynamic optimization odor representations slow temporal patterning mitral cell activity
mitral cells mcs olfactory bulb ob respond odors slow temporal firing patterns representation odor activity patterns across mc population thus changes continuously throughout stimulus odor-specific manner zebrafish ob found distributed temporal patterning progressively reduced similarity ensemble representations related odors thereby making odors representation specific time tuning individual mcs sharpened process hence individual responses mcs become specific odor-coding mc assemblies changed overlap decreased optimization ensemble representations occur among olfactory afferents resulted ob circuit dynamics time can therefore gradually optimize stimulus representations sensory network
