performing mathematical operations metamaterials 
introduce concept metamaterial analog computing based suitably designed metamaterial blocks can perform mathematical operations spatial differentiation integration convolution profile impinging wave propagates blocks two approaches presented achieve functionality: subwavelength structured metascreens combined graded-index waveguides ii multilayered slabs designed achieve desired spatial greens function techniques offer possibility miniaturized potentially integrable wave-based computing systems thinner conventional lens-based optical signal data processors several orders magnitude
