nucleosomal function kappa b kinase-alpha nf-kappa b-dependent gene expression 
nf-kappab principal transcriptional regulator diverse cytokine-mediated processes tightly controlled ikappab kinase complex ikk-alpha/beta/gamma ikk-beta ikk-gamma critical cytokine-induced nf-kappab function whereas ikk-alpha thought involved regulatory pathways- however recent data suggest role ikk-alpha nf-kappab-dependent gene expression response cytokine treatment- demonstrate nuclear accumulation ikk-alpha cytokine exposure suggesting nuclear function protein consistent chromatin immunoprecipitation chip assays reveal ikk-alpha recruited promoter regions nf-kappab-regulated genes stimulation tumour-necrosis factor-alpha notably nf-kappab-regulated gene expression suppressed loss ikk-alpha correlates complete loss gene-specific phosphorylation histone h3 serine modification previously associated positive gene expression furthermore show ikk-alpha can directly phosphorylate histone h3 vitro suggesting new substrate kinase propose ikk-alpha essential regulator nf-kappab-dependent gene expression control promoter-associated histone phosphorylation cytokine exposure findings provide additional insight role ikk complex nf-kappab-regulated gene expression
