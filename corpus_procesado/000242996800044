ground state pseudogap cuprate superconductors 
present studies electronic structure la2-xbaxcuo4 system superconductivity strongly suppressed static spin charge orders "stripes" develop near doping level x / using angle-resolved photoemission scanning tunneling microscopy detect energy gap fermi surface magnitude consistent d-wave symmetry linear density states vanishing four nodal points even superconductivity disappears x / thus nonsuperconducting striped state x / consistent phase-incoherent d-wave superconductor whose cooper pairs form spin-charge-ordered structures instead becoming superconducting
