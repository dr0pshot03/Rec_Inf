evidence large decadal variability tropical mean radiative energy budget 
widely assumed variations earths radiative energy budget large time space scales small present new evidence compilation two decades accurate satellite data top-of-atmosphere toa tropical radiative energy budget much dynamic variable previously thought results indicate radiation budget changes caused changes tropical mean cloudiness results several current climate model simulations fail predict large observed variation tropical energy budget missing variability models highlights critical need improve cloud modeling tropics prediction tropical climate interannual decadal time scales can improved
