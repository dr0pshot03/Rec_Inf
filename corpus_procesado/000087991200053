elevated uv-b radiation reduces genome stability plants
long-term depletion stratospheric ozone layer contributes increase terrestrial solar ultraviolet-b radiation- deleterious effects living organisms dna damage exposed elevated ultraviolet-b radiation uv-b nm plants display wide variety physiological morphological responses characterized acclimation adaptation show using special sun simulators elevated solar uv-b doses increase frequency somatic homologous dna rearrangements arabidopsis tobacco plants increases recombination accompanied strong induction photolyase rad51 gene expression genes putatively involved major dna repair pathways photoreactivation recombination repair mutant arabidopsis plants deficient photoreactivating ultraviolet-induced cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers recombination elevated uv-b regimes greatly exceeds wild-type levels results show homologous recombination repair pathways might involved eliminating uv-b-induced dna lesions plants thus increases terrestrial solar uv-b radiation forecasted early 21st century may affect genome stability plants
