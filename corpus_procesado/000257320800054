sporadic autonomic dysregulation death associated excessive serotonin autoinhibition 
sudden infant death syndrome leading cause death postneonatal period developed countries postmortem studies show alterations serotonin neurons brainstem infants however mechanism altered serotonin homeostasis might cause sudden death unknown investigated consequences altering autoinhibitory capacity serotonin neurons reversible overexpression serotonin 1a autoreceptors transgenic mice overexpressing mice exhibited sporadic bradycardia hypothermia occurred limited developmental period frequently progressed death moreover overexpressing mice failed activate autonomic target organs response environmental challenges findings show excessive serotonin autoinhibition risk factor catastrophic autonomic dysregulation provide mechanism role altered serotonin homeostasis sudden infant death syndrome
