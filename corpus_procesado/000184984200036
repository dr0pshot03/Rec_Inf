controlling molecular deposition layer structure supramolecular surface assemblies 
selective non-covalent interactions widely exploited solution-based chemistry direct assembly molecules nanometre-sized functional structures capsules switches prototype machines- recently concepts supramolecular organization also applied two-dimensional assemblies surfaces stabilized hydrogen bonding- dipolar coupling- metal co-ordination structures realized date include isolated rows- clusters extended networks- well complex multicomponent arrangements another approach controlling surface structures uses adsorbed molecular monolayers create preferential binding sites accommodate individual target molecules combine approaches using hydrogen bonding guide assembly two types molecules two-dimensional open honeycomb network controls templates new surface phases formed subsequently deposited fullerene molecules find open network acts two-dimensional array large pores sufficient capacity accommodate several large guest molecules network also serving template formation fullerene layer
