two types dopamine neuron distinctly convey positive negative motivational signals
midbrain dopamine neurons activated reward sensory stimuli predicting reward- excitatory responses increase reward value increases response property led hypothesis dopamine neurons encode value-related signals inhibited aversive events show true subset dopamine neurons recorded activity dopamine neurons monkeys macaca mulatta pavlovian procedure appetitive aversive outcomes liquid rewards airpuffs directed face respectively found dopamine neurons excited reward-predicting stimuli inhibited airpuff-predicting stimuli value hypothesis predicts however greater number dopamine neurons excited stimuli inconsistent hypothesis dopamine neurons also excited rewards airpuffs especially unpredictable neurons excited airpuff-predicting stimuli located dorsolaterally substantia nigra pars compacta whereas neurons inhibited stimuli located ventromedially ventral tegmental area similar anatomical difference observed responses actual airpuffs findings suggest different groups dopamine neurons convey motivational signals distinct manners
