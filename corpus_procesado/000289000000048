bacteria-phage antagonistic coevolution soil 
bacteria viruses phages undergo rapid coevolution test tubes relevance natural environments unclear using "mark-recapture" approach showed rapid coevolution bacteria phages soil community unlike coevolution vitro characterized increases infectivity resistance time arms race dynamics coevolution soil resulted hosts resistant contemporary past future parasites fluctuating selection dynamics fluctuating selection dynamics can potentially continue indefinitely can explained fitness costs constraining evolution high levels resistance soil results suggest rapid coevolution bacteria phage likely play key role structuring natural microbial communities
