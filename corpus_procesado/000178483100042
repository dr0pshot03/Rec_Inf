fully understand structure dynamics earths convecting mantle origins temperature variations within mantle need resolved different hypotheses proposed account temperature variations: example heat coming decay radioactive elements heat flowing earths core addition theoretical studies- suggest thermal properties continental masses can affect mantle convection quantitative data allow us test models scarce address latter problem examined chemistry mid-ocean-ridge basalt-which reflects temperature source mantle-as function distance ridge closest continental margin correlation observed oceanic ridges close subduction zones hotspots subduction zones probably inhibit thermal transfer mantle beneath continents ocean whereas hotspots influence major-element chemistry ridge basalts makes interpretation respect mantle temperature difficult however observe significant correlation mid-oceanic basalts atlantic indian oceans conclude location continental masses relative active ridges influences large-scale thermal structure mantle estimate mantle cools 1degreesc per kilometre continental margins
