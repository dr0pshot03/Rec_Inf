experimental observation nonlinear traveling waves turbulent pipe flow
transition turbulence pipe flow one fundamental longest-standing problems fluid dynamics stability theory suggests flow remains laminar flow rates practice pipe flow becomes turbulent even moderate speeds transition drastically affects transport efficiency mass momentum heat basis recent discovery unstable traveling waves computational studies navier-stokes equations ideas dynamical systems theory model transition process suggested report experimental observation traveling waves pipe flow confirming proposed transition scenario suggesting dynamics associated unstable states may indeed capture nature fluid turbulence
