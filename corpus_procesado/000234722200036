stretchable form single-crystal silicon high-performance electronics rubber substrates 
produced stretchable form silicon consists submicrometer single-crystal elements structured shapes microscale periodic wavelike geometries supported elastomeric substrate "wavy" silicon can reversibly stretched compressed large levels strain without damaging silicon amplitudes periods waves change accommodate deformations thereby avoiding substantial strains silicon dielectrics patterns dopants electrodes elements directly integrated silicon yield fully formed high-performance "wavy" metal oxide semiconductor field-effect transistors p-n diodes devices electronic circuits can stretched compressed similarly large levels strain
