merging allylic carbon-hydrogen selective carbon-carbon bond activation 
since nineteenth century many synthetic organic chemists focused developing new strategies regio- diastereo enantioselectively build carbon-carbon carbon-heteroatom bonds predictable efficient manner- ideal syntheses use least number synthetic steps functional group transformations by-products maximum atom efficiency one potentially attractive method synthesis molecular skeletons difficult prepare selective activation c-h c-c bonds- instead conventional construction new c-c bonds present approach exploits multifold reactivity easily accessible substrates single organometallic species furnish complex molecular scaffolds merging otherwise difficult transformations: allylic c-h selective c-c bond activations- resulting bifunctional nucleophilic species all-carbon quaternary stereogenic centre can selectively derivatized addition two different electrophiles obtain complex molecular architecture easily available starting materials
