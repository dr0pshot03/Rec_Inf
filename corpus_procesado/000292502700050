coupled circumferential motions cell wall synthesis machinery mreb filaments b subtilis
rod-shaped bacteria elongate action cell wall synthesis complexes linked underlying dynamic mreb filaments understand movements filaments relate cell wall synthesis characterized dynamics mreb cell wall elongation machinery using high-precision particle tracking bacillus subtilis found mreb elongation machinery moved circumferentially around cell perpendicular length nearby synthesis complexes mreb filaments moving independently directions inhibition cell wall synthesis various methods blocked movement mreb thus bacteria elongate uncoordinated circumferential movements synthetic complexes insert radial hoops new peptidoglycan transit possibly driving motion underlying mreb filaments
