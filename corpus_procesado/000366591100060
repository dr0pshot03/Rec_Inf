multidecadal increase north atlantic coccolithophores potential role rising co2 
anthropogenic carbon dioxide co2 emissions acidify oceans calcifiers generally expected negatively affected however using data continuous plankton recorder show coccolithophore occurrence north atlantic increased similar % used random forest models examine possible environmental drivers change finding co2 atlantic multidecadal oscillation best predictors leading us hypothesize higher co2 levels might encouraging growth compilation independent laboratory studies supports hypothesis study shows long-term basin-scale increase coccolithophores suggests increasing co2 temperature accelerated growth phytoplankton group important carbon cycling
