anabaena sensory rhodopsin: photochromic color sensor angstrom 
microbial sensory rhodopsins family membrane-embedded photoreceptors prokaryotic eukaryotic organisms structures archaeal rhodopsins function light-driven ion pumps photosensors reported present structure eubacterial rhodopsin differs previously characterized archaeal rhodopsins chromophore cytoplasmic-side portions anabaena sensory rhodopsin exhibits light-induced interconversion stable -cis all-trans states retinylidene protein ratio cis trans chromophore forms depends wavelength illumination thus providing mechanism single protein signal color light example regulate color-sensitive processes chromatic adaptation photosynthesis cytoplasmic half channel highly hydrophobic archaeal rhodopsins contains numerous hydrophilic residues networked water molecules providing connection photoactive site cytoplasmic surface believed interact receptors soluble -kilodalton transducer
