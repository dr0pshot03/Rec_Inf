universal feature response stress nutrient limitation transcriptional upregulation genes encode proteins important survival many conditions overall protein synthesis level reduced thereby dampening stress response level protein expression example glucose starvation saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast translation rapidly repressed yet transcription many stress-and glucose-repressed genes increased show using ribosomal profiling microscopy transcriptionally upregulated gene set consists two classes: one class produces messenger rnas translated glucose starvation diffusely localized cytoplasm including many heat-shock protein mrnas class produces mrnas efficiently translated glucose starvation concentrated foci co-localize p bodies stress granules class isenriched mrnas involved glucose metabolism surprisingly information specifying differential localization protein production two classes mrna encoded promoter sequence: promoter responsiveness heat-shock factor hsf1 specifies diffuse cytoplasmic localization higher protein production glucose starvation thus promoter sequences can influence levels mrnas also subcellular localization mrnas efficiency translated enabling cells tailor protein production environmental conditions
