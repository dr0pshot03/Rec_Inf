forming all-carbon quaternary stereogenic centres acyclic systems alkynes 
formation all-carbon quaternary stereocentres acyclic systems one difficult contemporary challenges modern synthetic organic chemistry particularly challenging preparation all-carbon quaternary stereocentres aldol adducts difficulty problematic aldol reaction represents one valuable chemical transformations organic synthesis main problem limits formation stereocentres absence efficient method preparing stereodefined trisubstituted enolates acyclic systems- describe different approach involves formation two new stereogenic centres-including all-carbon quaternary one-via combined carbometalation-oxidation reaction organocuprate give stereodefined trisubstituted enolate use method generate series aldol mannich products ynamides excellent diastereomeric enantiomeric ratios moderate yields
