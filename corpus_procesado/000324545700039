strong magnetic field around supermassive black hole centre galaxy 
earths nearest candidate supermassive black hole lies centre milky way electromagnetic emission thought powered radiatively inefficient accretion gas environment standard mode energy supply galactic nuclei x-ray measurements already resolved tenuous hot gas component black hole can fed magnetization gas however crucial parameter determining structure accretion flow remains unknown strong magnetic fields can influence dynamics accretion remove angular momentum infalling gas expel matter relativistic jets lead synchrotron emission previously observed- report multi-frequency radio measurements newly discovered pulsar close galactic centre- show pulsars unusually large faraday rotation rotation plane polarization emission presence external magnetic field indicates dynamically important magnetic field near black hole field accreted event horizon provides enough magnetic flux explain observed emission-from radio x-ray wavelengths-from black hole
