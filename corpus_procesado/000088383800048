mice overexpressing human uncoupling protein skeletal muscle hyperphagic lean
uncoupling protein ucp- recently identified member mitochondrial transporter superfamily expressed predominantly skeletal muscle however close relative ucp expressed exclusively brown adipose tissue tissue whose main function fat combustion thermogenesis studies expression ucp animals humans different physiological situations support role ucp energy balance lipid metabolism however direct evidence roles lacking describe creation transgenic mice overexpress human ucp skeletal muscle mice hyperphagic weigh less wild-type littermates magnetic resonance imaging shows striking reduction adipose tissue mass mice also exhibit lower fasting plasma glucose insulin levels increased glucose clearance rate provides evidence skeletal muscle ucp potential influence metabolic rate glucose homeostasis whole animal
