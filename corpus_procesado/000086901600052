origin red algae evolution chloroplasts
chloroplast structure genome analyses support hypothesis three groups organisms originated primary photosynthetic endosymbiosis cyanobacterium eukaryotic host: green plants green algae + land plants red algae glaucophytes example cyanophora although phylogenies based several mitochondrial genes support specific green plants/red algae relationship phylogenetic analysis nucleus-encoded genes yields inconclusive sometimes contradictory results address problem analysed alternative nuclear marker elongation factor included new red algae protist sequences provide significant support sisterhood green plants red algae sisterhood also significantly supported multi-gene analysis fusion nuclear markers amino acids addition analysis alternative fusion nuclear markers amino acids indicates glaucophytes may closest relatives green plants/red algae group thus study provides evidence nuclear markers single primary endosymbiosis origin groups supports kingdom plantae comprising green plants red algae glaucophytes
