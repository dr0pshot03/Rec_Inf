targeting plasticity mitochondrial proteins revealed proximity-specific ribosome profiling 
nearly mitochondrial proteins nuclear-encoded targeted mitochondrial destination cytosol used proximity-specific ribosome profiling comprehensively measure translation mitochondrial surface yeast inner-membrane proteins cotranslationally targeted mitochondria reminiscent proteins entering endoplasmic reticulum er comparison mitochondrial er localization demonstrated vast majority proteins targeted specific organelle prominent exception fumarate reductase osm1 known reside mitochondria identified conserved er isoform osm1 contributes oxidative protein-folding capacity organelle dual localization enabled alternative translation initiation sites encoding distinct targeting signals findings highlight exquisite vivo specificity organellar targeting mechanisms
