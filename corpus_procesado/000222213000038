role co2 formation gold deposits 
much global gold production come deposits uneconomic concentrations base metals copper lead zinc gold-only deposits thought formed hot aqueous fluids rich carbon dioxide minor significance attached role co2 process gold transport chemical bonding gold ions co2 species strong unlikely co2 direct role gold transport alternative indirect role co2 weak acid buffers ph also appeared unlikely previously inferred ph values gold-bearing fluids variable show calculated ph values unlikely record conditions gold transport propose co2 may play critical role gold transport buffering fluid ph range elevated gold concentration can maintained complexation reduced sulphur conclusions supported geochemical modelling may provide platform new gold exploration methods
