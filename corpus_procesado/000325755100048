measuring chromatin interaction dynamics second time scale single-copy genes 
chromatin immunoprecipitation chip assay widely used capture interactions chromatin regulatory proteins unknown stable native interactions although live-cell imaging suggests short-lived interactions tandem gene arrays current methods measure rapid binding dynamics single-copy genes show using modified chip assay subsecond temporal resolution time dependence formaldehyde cross-linking can used extract vivo rates site-specific chromatin interactions varying similar fold dynamic range using method show regulatory process can shift weakly bound tata-binding protein stable promoter interactions thereby facilitating transcription complex formation assay provides approach systematic quantitative analyses chromatin binding dynamics vivo
