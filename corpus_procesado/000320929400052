elastic energy storage shoulder evolution high-speed throwing homo 
primates including chimpanzees throw objects occasionally humans regularly throw projectiles high speed accuracy darwin noted unique throwing abilities humans made possible bipedalism emancipated arms enabled foragers hunt effectively using projectiles however little consideration evolution throwing years since darwin made observations part lack evidence hominins evolved ability generate high-speed throws- use experimental studies humans throwing projectiles show throwing capabilities largely result several derived anatomical features enable elastic energy storage release shoulder features first appear together approximately million years ago species homo erectus taking consideration archaeological evidence suggesting hunting activity intensified around time conclude selection throwing means hunt probably important role evolution genus homo
