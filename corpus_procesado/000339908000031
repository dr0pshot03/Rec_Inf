controlled synthesis single-chirality carbon nanotubes 
past two decades single-walled carbon nanotubes swcnts received much attention extraordinary properties promising numerous applications12 many properties depend sensitively swcnt structure characterized chiral index nm denotes length orientation circumferential vector hexagonal carbon lattice electronic properties particularly strongly affected subtle structural changes switching tubes metallic semiconducting various band-gaps monodisperse single-chirality single n m index swcnts thus needed fully exploit technological potential12 controlled synthesis catalyst engineering3- end-cap engineering7 cloning strategies89 also tube sorting based chromatography1011 density-gradient centrifugation electrophoresis techniques12 delivered swcnt samples narrow distributions tube diameter large fraction predetermined tube type effective pathway truly monodisperse swcnts remains elusive use template molecules unambiguously dictate diameter chirality resulting nanotube813- holds great promise regard hitherto limited practical success71718 show bottom-up strategy can produce targeted nanotubes: convert molecular precursors ultrashort singly capped armchair nanotube seeds using surface-catalysed cyclodehydrogenation platinum surface elongate subsequent growth phase produce single-chirality essentially defect-free swcnts lengths hundred nanometres expect on-surface synthesis approach will provide route nanotube-based materials highly optimized properties applications light detectors photovoltaics field-effect transistors sensors2
