targeted degradation toc1 ztl modulates circadian function arabidopsis thaliana
underlying mechanism circadian rhythmicity appears conserved among organisms based negative transcriptional feedback loops forming cellular oscillator clock circadian changes protein stability phosphorylation subcellular localization also contribute generation maintenance clock plants several genes shown closely associated circadian system however molecular mechanisms proposed regulate plant clock mostly based regulation transcriptional level provide genetic molecular evidence role zeitlupe ztl- targeted degradation timing cab expression toc1 arabidopsis thaliana thale cress physical interaction toc1 ztl abolished ztl mutation resulting constitutive levels toc1 protein expression dark-dependent degradation toc1 protein requires functional ztl prevented inhibiting proteosome pathway results show toc1 ztl interaction important control toc1 protein stability probably responsible regulation circadian period clock
