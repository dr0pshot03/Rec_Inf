large-scale genetic analysis lethal phenotypes elucidated molecular underpinnings many biological processes using bacterial clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats crispr system constructed genome-wide single-guide rna library screen genes required proliferation survival human cancer cell line screen revealed set cell-essential genes validated orthogonal gene-trap-based screen comparison yeast gene knockouts set enriched genes encode components fundamental pathways expressed high levels contain inactivating polymorphisms human population also uncovered large group uncharacterized genes involved rna processing number whose products localize nucleolus last screens additional cell lines showed high degree overlap gene essentiality also revealed differences specific cell line cancer type reflect developmental origin oncogenic drivers paralogous gene expression pattern chromosomal structure line results demonstrate power crispr-based screens suggest general strategy identifying liabilities cancer cells
