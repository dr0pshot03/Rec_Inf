voltage-sensing mechanism conserved among ion channels gated opposite voltages
hyperpolarization-activated cyclic-nucleotide-gated hcn ion channels found rhythmically firing cells brain heart cation current hcn channels called i-h i-f causes cells fire repeatedly channels also found non-pacing cells control resting membrane properties modulate synaptic transmission mediate long-term potentiation limit extreme hyperpolarizations- hcn channels share sequence motifs depolarization-activated potassium kv channels fourth transmembrane segment s4 s4 main voltage sensor kv channels transmembrane movement s4 charges triggers opening activation gate- using cysteine accessibility methods- investigate whether s4 moves hcn channel show s4 movement conserved kv hcn channels indicates s4 also voltage sensor hcn channels results suggest conserved voltage-sensing mechanism operates oppositely voltage-gated kv hcn channels different coupling mechanisms voltage sensor activation gate two different channels
