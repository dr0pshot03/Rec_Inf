future quantum communication will rely integration single-photon sources quantum memories systems strong single-photon nonlinearities1 two key parameters crucial single-photon source: high photon flux small bandwidth spectral match components system atoms ions may act single-photon sources-owing narrow-band emission intrinsic spectral match atomic systems-and can serve quantum nonlinear elements unfortunately emission rates still limited even highly efficient cavity designs2 single solid-state emitters single organic dye molecules significantly brighter3 allow narrowband photons4; shown potential variety quantum optical experiments56 yet interfaced components stationary memory qubits describe optical interaction fourier-limited photons single organic molecule atomic alkali vapours can constitute efficient quantum memory single-photon emission rates reach several hundred thousand counts per second show high spectral brightness detectable photons per second per megahertz bandwidth molecular emission robust demonstrate perfect tuning spectral transitions sodium d line efficient filtering even emitters ambient conditions addition achieve storage molecular photons originating single dibenzanthanthrene molecule atomic sodium vapour given large set molecular emission lines matching atomic transitions results enable combination almost ideal single-photon sources various atomic vapours experiments giant single photon nonlinearities mediated example rydberg atoms78 become feasible
