evolutionary origin development snake fangs 
many advanced snakes use fangs specialized teeth associated venom gland introduce venom prey attacker various front rear fanged groups recognized according whether fangs positioned anterior example cobras vipers posterior example grass snakes upper jaw- fundamental controversy snake evolution whether front rear fangs share evolutionary developmental origin- resolving controversy identify major evolutionary transition underlying massive radiation advanced snakes associated developmental events examine issue visualizing tooth forming epithelium upper jaw snake embryos covering eight species use sonic hedgehog gene marker- three dimensionally reconstruct development embryos show front fangs develop posterior end upper jaw strikingly similar morphogenesis rear fangs consistent homologous front fanged snakes anterior part upper jaw lacks sonic hedgehog expression ontogenetic allometry displaces fang posterior developmental origin adult front position consistent ancestral posterior position front fang rear fanged snakes fangs develop independent posterior dental lamina retain posterior position light findings put forward new model evolution snake fangs: posterior subregion tooth forming epithelium became developmentally uncoupled remaining dentition allowed posterior teeth evolve independently close association venom gland becoming highly modified different lineages developmental event facilitated massive radiation advanced snakes cenozoic era resulting spectacular diversity snakes seen today
