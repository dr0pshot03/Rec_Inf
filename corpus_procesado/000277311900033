fast torsional waves strong magnetic field within earths core 
magnetic field inside earths fluid electrically conducting outer core directly probed root-mean-squared rms intensity resolved part radial magnetic field core-mantle boundary mt assumptions needed infer strength field inside core recent diagnostics obtained numerical geodynamo models indicate magnitude dipole field surface fluid dynamo ten times weaker rms field strength interior yield intensity order several millitesla within earths core however year signal found variation length day long associated magneto-hydrodynamic torsional waves carried much weaker internal field according studies rms strength field cylindrical radial direction calculated length scales mt figure even smaller rms strength large-scale spherical harmonic degree n < field visible core-mantle boundary reconcile numerical geodynamo models studies geostrophic motions earths core rely geomagnetic data ensemble inversion core flow models find torsional wave recurring every six years angular momentum accounts well phase amplitude six-year signal change length day detected second half twentieth century takes four years wave propagate throughout fluid outer core travel time translates slowness alfven waves corresponds rms field strength cylindrical radial direction approximately mt assuming isotropy yields rms field strength mt inside earths core
