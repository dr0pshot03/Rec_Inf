microscopic observation magnon bound states dynamics 
existence bound states elementary spin waves magnons one-dimensional quantum magnets predicted almost years ago identifying signatures magnon bound states far remained subject intense theoretical research- detection proved challenging experiments ultracold atoms offer ideal setting find bound states tracking spin dynamics single-spin single-site resolution following local excitation use situ correlation measurements observe two-magnon bound states directly one-dimensional heisenberg spin chain comprising ultracold bosonic atoms optical lattice observe quantum dynamics free bound magnon states time-resolved measurements two spin impurities increased effective mass compound magnon state results slower spin dynamics compared single-magnon excitations also determine decay time bound magnons probably limited scattering thermal fluctuations system results provide new way studying fundamental properties quantum magnets generally properties interacting impurities quantum many-body systems
