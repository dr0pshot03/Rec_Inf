facile splitting hydrogen ammonia nucleophilic activation single carbon center 
possessing lone pair electrons accessible vacant orbital singlet carbenes resemble transition metal centers thus potentially mimic chemical behavior although singlet diamino carbenes inert toward dihydrogen shown nucleophilic electrophilic alkyl amino carbenes can activate h mild conditions reaction long known transition metals however contrast transition metals act electrophiles toward dihydrogen carbenes primarily behave nucleophiles creating hydride-like hydrogen attacks positively polarized carbon center nucleophilic behavior allows carbenes activate nh well difficult task transition metals formation lewis acid-base adducts
