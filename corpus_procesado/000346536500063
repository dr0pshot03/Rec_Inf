extreme electric fields power catalysis active site ketosteroid isomerase 
enzymes use protein architecture impose specific electrostatic fields onto bound substrates magnitude catalytic effect electric fields proven difficult quantify standard experimental approaches using vibrational stark effect spectroscopy found active site enzyme ketosteroid isomerase ksi exerts extremely large electric field onto co chemical bond undergoes charge rearrangement ksis rate-determining step moreover found magnitude electric field exerted active site strongly correlates enzymes catalytic rate enhancement enabling us quantify fraction catalytic effect electrostatic origin measurements described may help explain role electrostatics many enzymes biomolecular systems
