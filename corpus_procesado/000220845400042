vortex core-driven magnetization dynamics
time-resolved x-ray imaging shows magnetization dynamics micron-sized pattern containing ferromagnetic vortex determined handedness chirality out-of-plane magnetization nanometer-scale vortex core induces three-dimensional handedness planar magnetic structure leading precessional motion core parallel subnanosecond field pulse core velocity order magnitude higher expected static susceptibility results demonstrate handedness already well known important biological systems plays important role dynamics microscopic magnets
