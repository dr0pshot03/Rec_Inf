correlated electron emission multiphoton double ionization
electronic correlations govern dynamics many phenomena nature chemical reactions solid state effects including superconductivity correlation effects can clearly investigated processes involving single atoms particular emission two electrons atom-induced impact single photon charged particle short laser pulse-has become standard process studies dynamical electron correlations atoms molecules exposed laser fields comparable intensity nuclear fields extremely high probabilities double ionization attributed electron-electron interaction report strong correlation magnitude direction momentum two electrons emitted argon atom driven femtosecond laser pulse tw cm- increasing laser intensity causes momentum correlation electrons lost implying transition laser-atom coupling mechanism takes place
