bacteria use type iv pili walk upright detach surfaces 
bacterial biofilms structured multicellular communities involved broad range infections knowing free-swimming bacteria adapt motility mechanisms near surfaces crucial understanding transition planktonic biofilm phenotypes translating microscopy movies searchable databases bacterial behavior identified fundamental type iv pili-driven mechanisms pseudomonas aeruginosa surface motility involved distinct foraging strategies bacteria stood upright "walked" trajectories optimized two-dimensional surface exploration vertical orientation facilitated surface detachment influence biofilm morphology
