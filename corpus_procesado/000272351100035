population compact elliptical galaxies detected virtual observatory 
compact elliptical galaxies characterized small sizes high stellar densities thought form tidal stripping massive progenitors however handful known preventing us understanding role played mechanism galaxy evolution present population compact elliptical galaxies gathered virtual observatory follow-up spectroscopy data mining using high-resolution images large databases show galaxies exhibit old metal-rich stellar populations different dwarf elliptical galaxies similar masses similar massive early-type galaxies supporting tidal stripping scenario internal properties reproduced numerical simulations result compact dynamically hot remnants resembling galaxies sample
