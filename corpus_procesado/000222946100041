universal scaling relation high-temperature superconductors
since discovery superconductivity elevated temperatures copper oxide materials considerable effort find universal trends correlations amongst physical quantities clue origin superconductivity one earliest patterns emerged linear scaling superfluid density rhos superconducting transition temperature t-c marks onset phase coherence referred uemura relation works reasonably well underdoped materials however describe optimally doped t-c maximum overdoped materials similarly attempt scale superfluid density dc conductivity sigmadc partially successful report simple scaling relation rhos proportional proportional todctc sigmadc measured approximately t-c holds tested high-t-c materials holds regardless doping level nature dopant electrons versus holes crystal structure type disorder direction parallel perpendicular copper oxygen planes
