structural basis broad potent neutralization hiv antibody vrc01 
hiv infection antibodies generated region viral gp120 envelope glycoprotein binds cd4 primary receptor hiv- among antibodies vrc01 achieves broad neutralization diverse viral strains determined crystal structure vrc01 complex human immunodeficiency virus hiv gp120 core vrc01 partially mimics cd4 interaction gp120 shift cd4-defined orientation however focuses vrc01 onto vulnerable site initial cd4 attachment allowing overcome glycan conformational masking diminishes neutralization potency cd4-binding-site antibodies achieve recognition vrc01 contacts gp120 mainly immunoglobulin v-gene regions substantially altered genomic precursors partial receptor mimicry extensive affinity maturation thus facilitate neutralization hiv natural human antibodies
