routing spike series dynamic circuits hippocampus 
recurrent inhibitory loops simple neuronal circuits found central nervous system yet little known physiological rules governing activity use simultaneous somatic dendritic recordings rat hippocampal slices show series action potentials pyramidal cells recurrent inhibition rapidly shifts soma apical dendrites two distinct inhibitory circuits sequentially recruited produce shift: one time-locked submillisecond precision onset action potential series transiently inhibits somatic perisomatic regions pyramidal cells activated proportion rate action potentials series durably inhibits distal apical dendrites two operating modes result synergy pre postsynaptic properties excitatory synapses onto recurrent inhibitory neurons distinct projection patterns thus onset series action potentials rate action potentials series selectively captured transformed different spatial patterns recurrent inhibition
