experimental realization one-atom laser regime strong coupling 
conventional lasers table-top systems microscopic devices typically operate so-called weak-coupling regime involving large numbers atoms photons individual quanta negligible impact system dynamics however longer case system approaches regime strong coupling number atoms photons can become quite small indeed lasing properties single atom resonant cavity extensively investigated theoretically- report experimental realization one-atom laser operated regime strong coupling exploit recent advances cavity quantum electrodynamics allow one atom isolated optical cavity regime one photon sufficient saturate atomic transition observed characteristics atom-cavity system qualitatively different familiar many-atom case specifically measurements intracavity photon number versus pump intensity indicate threshold lasing infer output flux cavity mode exceeds atomic fluorescence tenfold observations second-order intensity correlation function demonstrate one-atom laser generates manifestly quantum nonclassical light typified photon anti-bunching sub-poissonian photon statistics
