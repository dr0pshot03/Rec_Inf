crystal structure gamma delta t cell receptor ligand t22: truncated mhc-like fold 
murine t10 t22 highly related nonclassical major histocompatibility complex mhc class ib proteins bind certain gamma delta t cell receptors tcrs absence components crystal structure t22b angstroms reveals similarities mhc class molecules one side normal peptide-binding groove severely truncated allows direct access beta-sheet floor potential gamma delta tcr-binding sites can inferred functional mapping t10 t22 point mutants allelic variants thus t22 represents unusual variant mhc-like fold indicates gamma delta alpha beta tcrs interact differently respective mhc ligands
