global view lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary 
lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary divides rigid lid weaker mantle fundamental plate tectonics however depth defining mechanism well known analyzed years global seismic data using p-to-s ps converted phases imaged interface correlates tectonic environment varying +/ kilometers beneath precambrian shields platforms +/ kilometers beneath tectonically altered regions +/ kilometers oceanic island stations high-frequency ps observations require sharp discontinuity; therefore interface likely represents boundary composition melting anisotropy temperature alone likely represents lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary oceans tectonically altered regions may constitute another boundary cratonic regions lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary thought much deeper
