stars form cold molecular interstellar gas relatively rare local universe galaxies like milky way form new stars per year typical massive galaxies distant universe formed stars order magnitude rapidly unless star formation significantly efficient difference suggests young galaxies much molecular-gas rich molecular gas observations distant universe far largely restricted luminous rare objects including mergers quasars- accordingly yet clear idea gas content normal albeit massive galaxies report results survey molecular gas samples typical massive-star-forming galaxies mean redshifts < z > universe respectively % % current age measurements reveal distant star forming galaxies indeed gas rich star formation efficiency strongly dependent cosmic epoch average fraction cold gas relative total galaxy baryonic mass z z respectively % % three ten times higher todays massive spiral galaxies slow decrease z approximate z approximate probably requires mechanism semi-continuous replenishment fresh gas young galaxies
