forcing feedback internal variability global temperature trends
present-generation climate models simulate increase global-mean surface temperature gmst since whereas observations suggest warming hiatus unclear extent mismatch caused incorrect model forcing incorrect model response forcing random factors analyse simulations observations gmst show distribution simulated year trends shows systematic bias observations using multiple regression approach physically motivated surface energy balance isolate impact radiative forcing climate feedback ocean heat uptake gmst-with regression residual interpreted internal variability-and assess possible year trends differences simulated observed trends dominated random internal variability shorter timescale variations radiative forcings used drive models longer timescale either trend length spread simulated climate feedback leaves traceable imprint gmst trends consequently difference simulations observations claim climate models systematically overestimate response radiative forcing increasing greenhouse gas concentrations therefore seems unfounded
