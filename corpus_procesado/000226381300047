dynamical calibration mass luminosity relation low stellar masses young ages
mass fundamental parameter star yet also one difficult measure directly general astronomers estimate stellar masses determining luminosity using mass-luminosity relationship relationship never accurately calibrated young low-mass stars brown dwarfs masses low-mass objects therefore constrained theoretical models new high-contrast adaptive optics camera- enabled discovery young million years companion arcseconds au luminous > times brighter star ab doradus report dynamical determination mass newly resolved low-mass companion ab dor c whose mass +/ solar masses given measured micrometre luminosity found standard mass-luminosity relations overestimate near-infrared luminosity objects factor similar to2 young ages young cool objects hitherto thought substellar mass therefore twice massive means frequency brown dwarfs planetary mass objects young stellar clusters overestimated
