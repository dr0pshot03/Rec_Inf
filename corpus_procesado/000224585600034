finishing euchromatic sequence human genome 
sequence human genome encodes genetic instructions human physiology well rich information human evolution international human genome sequencing consortium reported draft sequence euchromatic portion human genome since international collaboration worked convert draft genome sequence high accuracy nearly complete coverage report result finishing process current genome sequence build contains billion nucleotides interrupted gaps covers similar to99% euchromatic genome accurate error rate similar to1 event per bases many remaining euchromatic gaps associated segmental duplications will require focused work new methods near-complete sequence first vertebrate greatly improves precision biological analyses human genome including studies gene number birth death notably human genome seems encode - protein-coding genes genome sequence reported serve firm foundation biomedical research decades ahead
