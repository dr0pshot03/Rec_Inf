astroglial metabolic networks sustain hippocampal synaptic transmission
astrocytes provide metabolic substrates neurons activity dependent manner however molecular mechanisms involved function well role synaptic transmission remain unclear show gap junction subunit proteins connexin allow intercellular trafficking glucose metabolites astroglial networks trafficking regulated glutamatergic synaptic activity mediated ampa receptors absence extracellular glucose delivery glucose lactate astrocytes sustains glutamatergic synaptic transmission epileptiform activity connected gap junctions results indicate astroglial gap junctions provide activity dependent intercellular pathway delivery energetic metabolites blood vessels distal neurons
