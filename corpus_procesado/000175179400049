optical projection tomography tool 3d microscopy gene expression studies
current techniques three-dimensional 3d optical microscopy deconvolution confocal microscopy optical coherence tomography generate 3d data optically sectioning specimen places severe constraints maximum thickness specimen can imaged developed microscopy technique uses optical projection tomography opt produce high-resolution 3d images fluorescent nonfluorescent biological specimens thickness millimeters opt microscopy allows rapid mapping tissue distribution rna protein expression intact embryos organ systems can therefore instrumental studies developmental biology gene function
