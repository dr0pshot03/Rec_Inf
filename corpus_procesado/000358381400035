origami thick panels
origami patterns including rigid origami patterns flat inflexible sheets joined creases primarily created zero-thickness sheets order apply fold structures roofs solar panels space mirrors thickness disregarded various methods suggested however generally involve adding materials offsetting panels away idealized sheet without altering kinematic model used simulate folding develop comprehensive kinematic synthesis rigid origami thick panels differs existing kinematic model capable reproducing motions identical zero-thickness origami approach proven effective typical origami can readily applied fold real engineering structures
