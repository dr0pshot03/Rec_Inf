optix drives repeated convergent evolution butterfly wing pattern mimicry 
mimicry-whereby warning signals different species evolve look similar-has long served paradigm convergent evolution little known however genes underlie evolution mimetic phenotypes extent different genes drive convergence characterize one major genes responsible mimetic wing pattern evolution heliconius butterflies mapping gene expression population genetic work identify single gene optix controls extreme red wing pattern variation across multiple species heliconius results show cis-regulatory evolution single transcription factor can repeatedly drive convergent evolution complex color patterns distantly related species thus blurring distinction convergence homology
