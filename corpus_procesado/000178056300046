prestin required electromotility outer hair cell cochlear amplifier 
hearing sensitivity mammals enhanced db fold mechanical amplification thought generated one class cochlear sensory cells outer hair cells- addition mechano-electrical transduction required auditory sensation mammalian outer hair cells also perform electromechanical transduction whereby transmembrane voltage drives cellular length changes audio frequencies vitro- electromotility thought arise voltage-gated conformational changes membrane protein prestin proposed molecular motor- show targeted deletion prestin mice results loss outer hair cell electromotility vitro db loss cochlear sensitivity vivo without disruption mechano-electrical transduction outer hair cells heterozygotes electromotility halved twofold db increase cochlear thresholds results suggest prestin indeed motor protein simple direct coupling electromotility cochlear amplification need invoke additional active processes explain cochlear sensitivity mammalian ear
