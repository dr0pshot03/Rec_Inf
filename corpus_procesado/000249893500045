reconciling complexity stability naturally assembling food webs 
understanding complex food webs assemble time fundamental ecological theory development sustainable strategies ecosystem conservation restoration build-up complexity communities theoretically difficult random-pattern models complexity leads instability growing evidence however nonrandom patterns strengths interactions predators prey strongly enhance system stability- show patterns explain stability naturally assembling communities present two series below-ground food webs along natural productivity gradients vegetation successions complexity food webs increased along gradients stability food webs captured measuring weight feedback loops three interacting species locked omnivory low predator-prey biomass ratios omnivorous loops shown crucial role preserving stability productivity complexity increased succession results show build-up food-web complexity natural productivity gradients pin feedback loops govern stability whole webs show heaviest three-link feedback loop network predator-prey effects limits stability weight feedback loops kept relatively low biomass build-up successional process complexity lead instability
