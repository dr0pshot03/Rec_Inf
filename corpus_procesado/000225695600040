organic aerosol growth mechanisms climate-forcing implications
surface volume-limited chemical reactions atmospheric aerosol particles cause growth changing organic composition % per day many particles contain carbonaceous components mineral dust combustion emissions africa asia north america reveal reaction rates three times slower typically used climate models slower rates converting volatile hydrophobic condensed hygroscopic organic compounds increase carbonaceous particle burdens climate models % producing organic aerosol climate forcings much watt per square meter cooling + watt per square meter warming
