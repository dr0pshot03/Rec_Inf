resonant amplification magnetic domain-wall motion train current pulses
current-induced motion magnetic domain walls confined nanostructures interest applications magnetoelectronic devices domain wall serves logic gate memory element injection spin-polarized current threshold value domain wall confined pinning potential results precessional motion within potential well show using short train current pulses whose length spacing tuned precession frequency domain walls oscillations can resonantly amplified makes possible motion domain walls much reduced currents five times smaller absence resonant amplification
