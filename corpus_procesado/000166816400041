wolbachia-induced incompatibility precedes hybrid incompatibilities nasonia
wolbachia cytoplasmically inherited bacteria cause number reproductive alterations insects including cytoplasmic incompatibility incompatibility sperm egg results loss sperm chromosomes following fertilization wolbachia estimated infect % insect species also common arachnids isopods nematodes therefore wolbachia-induced cytoplasmic incompatibility important factor promoting rapid speciation invertebrates although contention controversial show high levels bidirectional cytoplasmic incompatibility two closely related species insects parasitic wasps nasonia giraulti nasonia longicornis preceded evolution postmating reproductive barriers presence wolbachia severely reduces frequency hybrid offspring interspecies crosses however antibiotic curing insects results production hybrids furthermore f f hybrids completely viable fertile indicating absence f f hybrid breakdown partial interspecific sexual isolation occurs yet asymmetric incomplete results indicate wolbachia-induced reproductive isolation occurred early stages speciation system evolution postmating isolating mechanisms example hybrid inviability hybrid sterility
