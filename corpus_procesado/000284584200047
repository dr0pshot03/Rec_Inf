amino-terminal disease hotspot ryanodine receptors forms cytoplasmic vestibule 
many physiological events require transient increases cytosolic ca2+ concentrations ryanodine receptors ryrs ion channels govern release ca2+ endoplasmic sarcoplasmic reticulum mutations ryrs can lead severe genetic conditions affect cardiac skeletal muscle locating mutated residues full-length channel structure difficult show angstrom resolution crystal structure region spanning three domains ryr type ryr1 encompassing amino acid residues domains interact predominantly hydrophilic interface docking ryr1 electron microscopy maps unambiguously places domains cytoplasmic portion channel forming kda cytoplasmic vestibule around four-fold symmetry axis pinpoint exact locations disease-associated mutations full-length ryr1 ryr2 mutations can classified three groups: destabilize interfaces three amino-terminal domains disturb folding individual domains affect one six interfaces parts receptor propose model whereby opening ryr coincides allosterically coupled motions within n-terminal domains process can affected mutations target various interfaces within across subunits crystal structure provides framework understand many disease-associated mutations ryrs studied using functional methods will useful developing new strategies modulate ryr function disease states
