remote electronic control dna hybridization inductive coupling attached metal nanocrystal antenna
increasingly detailed structural dynamic studies highlighting precision biomolecules execute often complex tasks molecular scale efficiency versatility processes inspired many attempts mimic harness date biomolecules used perform computational operations actuation construct artificial transcriptional loops behave like simple circuit elements direct assembly nanocrystals development approaches requires new tools physical chemical manipulation biological systems biomolecular activity triggered optically use chromophores- direct electronic control biomolecular machinery specific fully reversible manner yet achieved demonstrate remote electronic control hybridization behaviour dna molecules inductive coupling radio-frequency magnetic field metal nanocrystal covalently linked dna inductive coupling nanocrystal increases local temperature bound dna thereby inducing denaturation leaving surrounding molecules relatively unaffected moreover dissolved biomolecules dissipate heat less picoseconds ref switching fully reversible inductive heating macroscopic samples widely used- present approach allow extension concept control hybridization thus broad range biological functions molecular scale
