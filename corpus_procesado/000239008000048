selective silencing foreign dna low gc content h-ns protein salmonella
horizontal gene transfer plays major role microbial evolution however newly acquired sequences can decrease fitness unless integrated preexisting regulatory networks found histone-like nucleoid structuring protein h-ns selectively silences horizontally acquired genes targeting sequences gc content lower resident genome mutations hns lethal salmonella unless accompanied compensatory mutations regulatory loci thus h-ns provides previously unrecognized mechanism bacterial defense foreign dna enabling acquisition dna exogenous sources avoiding detrimental consequences unregulated expression newly acquired genes characteristic gc/at ratios bacterial genomes may facilitate discrimination cells dna foreign dna
