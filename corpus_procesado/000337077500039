neural migration structures netrin bound two receptors provide insight axon guidance mechanism
netrins secreted proteins regulate axon guidance neuronal migration deleted colorectal cancer dcc well-established netrin receptor mediating attractive responses provide evidence close relative neogenin also functional netrin receptor acts dcc mediate guidance vivo determined structures functional netrin region alone complexes neogenin dcc netrin rigid elongated structure containing two receptor-binding sites opposite ends brings together receptor molecules ligand/receptor complexes reveal two distinct architectures: : heterotetramer continuous ligand/receptor assembly differences result different lengths linker connecting receptor domains fibronectin type iii domain fn4 fn5 differs among dcc neogenin splice variants providing basis diverse signaling outcomes
