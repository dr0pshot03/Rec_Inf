ballistic carbon nanotube field-effect transistors
common feature single-walled carbon-nanotube field-effect transistors fabricated date presence schottky barrier nanotube-metal junctions- energy barriers severely limit transistor conductance state reduce current delivery capability-a key determinant device performance show contacting semiconducting single-walled nanotubes palladium noble metal high work function good wetting interactions nanotubes greatly reduces eliminates barriers transport valence band nanotubes situ modification electrode work function hydrogen carried shed light nature contacts pd contacts states semiconducting nanotubes can behave like ohmically contacted ballistic metallic tubes exhibiting room-temperature conductance near ballistic transport limit 4e/h refs high current-carrying capability similar to25 mua per tube fabry-perot interferences low temperatures high voltage operation current saturation appears set backscattering charge carriers optical phonons high-performance ballistic nanotube field-effect transistors zero slightly negative schottky barriers thus realized
