morning evening peaks activity rely different clock neurons drosophila brain 
drosophila clock situated brain controls circadian rhythms locomotor activity clock relies several groups neurons express period per protein including ventral lateral neurons lnvs express pigment-dispersing factor pdf neuropeptide pdf-negative dorsal lateral neurons lnds normal cycles day night adult flies exhibit morning evening peaks activity however contribution different clock neurons rest activity pattern remains unknown used targeted expression per restore clock function specific subsets lateral neurons arrhythmic per mutant flies show per expression restricted lnvs restores morning activity whereas expression per lnvs lnds also restores evening activity provides first neuronal bases morning evening oscillators drosophila brain furthermore show lnvs alone can generate h activity rhythms constant darkness indicating morning oscillator sufficient drive circadian system
