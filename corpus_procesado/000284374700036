zooming microscopic flow remotely detected mri 
magnetic resonance imaging mri can elucidate interior structure optically opaque object unparalleled detail ultimately limited need enclose object within detection coil; acquiring image increasingly smaller pixels reduces sensitivity pixel occupies proportionately smaller fraction detectors volume developed technique overcomes limitation means remotely detected mri images fluids flowing channel assemblies encoded phase intensity constituent molecules nuclear magnetic resonance signals decoded volume-matched detector fluids flow sample combination compressive sampling thus obtain microscopic images flow velocity distributions similar times faster possible conventional mri hardware results illustrate facile integration mri microfluidic assays suggest generalizations systems involving microscopic flow
