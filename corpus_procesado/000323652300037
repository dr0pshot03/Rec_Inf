stretchable transparent ionic conductors
existing stretchable transparent conductors mostly electronic conductors limit performance interconnects sensors actuators components stretchable electronics soft machines describe class devices enabled ionic conductors highly stretchable fully transparent light colors capable operation frequencies beyond kilohertz voltages kilovolts demonstrate transparent actuator can generate large strains transparent loudspeaker produces sound entire audible range electromechanical transduction achieved without electrochemical reaction ionic conductors higher resistivity many electronic conductors however large stretchability high transmittance required ionic conductors lower sheet resistance existing electronic conductors
