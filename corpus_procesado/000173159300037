reduced nitrogen fixation glacial ocean inferred changes marine nitrogen phosphorus inventories 
explain lower atmospheric co concentrations glacial periods suggested productivity marine phytoplankton stimulated increased flux iron-bearing dust oceans one component theory iron-an essential element/nutrient nitrogen-fixing organisms-will increase rate marine nitrogen fixation fuelling growth marine phytoplankton increasing co uptake present data questions hypothesis sediment core northwestern continental margin mexico show denitrification phosphorite formation-processes occur oxygen-deficient upwelling regions removing respectively nitrogen phosphorus ocean-declined glacial periods thus increasing marine inventories nitrogen phosphorus increases phosphorus smaller less rapid leading increased n/p ratios oceans acknowledging phytoplankton require nitrogen phosphorus constant proportions redfield ratio n/p ratios greater redfield ratio likely suppress nitrogen fixation suggest therefore marine productivity increase glacial periods response either increased nutrient inventories greater iron supply
