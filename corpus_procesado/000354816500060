recursive splicing long vertebrate genes 
generally believed splicing removes introns single units precursor messenger rna transcripts however long drosophila melanogaster introns contain cryptic site known recursive splice site rs-site enables multi-step process intron removal termed recursive splicing12 extent recursive splicing occurs species mechanistic basis examined identify highly conserved rs-sites genes expressed mammalian brain encode proteins functioning neuronal development moreover rs-sites found longest introns across vertebrates find vertebrate recursive splicing requires initial definition rs-exon follows rs-site rs-exon excluded dominant mrna isoform owing competition reconstituted splice site formed rs-site first splicing step conversely rs-exon included preceded cryptic promoters exons fail reconstitute efficient splice site rs-exons contain premature stop codon inclusion can decrease mrna stability thus establishing binary splicing switch rs-sites demarcate different mrna isoforms emerging long genes coupling cryptic elements inclusion rs-exons
