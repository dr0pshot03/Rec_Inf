identification vesicular glutamate transporter defines glutamatergic phenotype neurons 
glutamate major excitatory neurotransmitter mammalian central nervous system synaptic vesicles loaded neurotransmitter means specific vesicular transporters show expression bnpi vesicle-bound transporter associated sodium-dependent phosphate transport- results glutamate uptake intracellular vesicles substrate specificity energy dependence similar glutamate uptake synaptic vesicles stimulation exocytosis-fusion vesicles cell membrane release contents-resulted quantal release glutamate bnpi-expressing cells furthermore expressed bnpi neurons containing gaba gamma-aminobutyric acid maintained cultures single isolated neurons form synapses stimulation neurons component postsynaptic current mediated glutamate blocked combination glutamate receptor antagonists insensitive gabaa receptor antagonist conclude bnpi functions vesicular glutamate transporter expression bnpi suffices define glutamatergic phenotype neurons
