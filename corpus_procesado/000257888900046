bsks mediate signal transduction receptor kinase bri1 arabidopsis 
brassinosteroids brs bind extracellular domain receptor kinase bri1 activate signal transduction cascade regulates nuclear gene expression plant development many components br signaling pathway identified studied detail however substrate bri1 kinase transduces signal downstream components remains unknown proteomic studies plasma membrane proteins lead identification three homologous br signaling kinases bsk1 bsk2 bsk3 bsks phosphorylated bri1 vitro interact bri1 vivo genetic transgenic studies demonstrate bsks represent small family kinases activate br signaling downstream bri1 results demonstrate bsks substrates bri1 kinase activate downstream br signal transduction
