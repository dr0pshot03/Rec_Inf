targeted enhancement cortical-hippocampal brain networks associative memory
influential notion hippocampus supports associative memory interacting functionally distinct distributed brain regions directly tested humans therefore used targeted noninvasive electromagnetic stimulation modulate human cortical-hippocampal networks tested effects manipulation memory multiple-session stimulation increased functional connectivity among distributed cortical-hippocampal network regions concomitantly improved associative memory performance alterations involved localized long-term plasticity increases highly selective targeted brain regions enhancements connectivity associative memory persisted similar hours stimulation targeted cortical-hippocampal networks can thus enhanced noninvasively demonstrating role associative memory
