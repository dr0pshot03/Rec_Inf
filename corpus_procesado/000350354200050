probing johnson noise ballistic transport normal metals single-spin qubit 
thermally induced electrical currents known johnson noise cause fluctuating electric magnetic fields proximity conductor fluctuations intrinsically related conductivity metal use single-spin qubits associated nitrogen-vacancy centers diamond probe johnson noise vicinity conductive silver films measurements polycrystalline silver films range distances nanometers temperatures kelvin consistent classically expected behavior magnetic fluctuations however find johnson noise markedly suppressed next single-crystal films indicative substantial deviation ohms law length scales electron mean free path results consistent generalized model accounts ballistic motion electrons metal indicating appropriate conditions nearby electrodes may used controlling nanoscale optoelectronic atomic solid-state quantum systems
