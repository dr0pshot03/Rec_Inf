iron-clad fibers: metal-based biological strategy hard flexible coatings 
extensible byssal threads marine mussels shielded abrasion wave-swept habitats outer cuticle largely proteinaceous approximately fivefold harder thread core threads several species exhibit granular cuticles containing protein rich catecholic amino acid -dihydroxyphenylalanine dopa well inorganic ions notably fe3+ granular cuticles exhibit remarkable combination high hardness high extensibility explored byssus cuticle chemistry means situ resonance raman spectroscopy demonstrated cuticle polymeric scaffold stabilized catecholato-iron chelate complexes unusual clustered distribution consistent byssal cuticle chemistry mechanics present model dense cross-linking granules provides hardness whereas less cross-linked matrix provides extensibility
