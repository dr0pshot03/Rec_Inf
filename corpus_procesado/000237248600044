depolymerizing kinesin mcak uses lattice diffusion rapidly target microtubule ends 
microtubule cytoskeleton dynamic structure lengths microtubules tightly regulated one regulatory mechanism depolymerization microtubules motor proteins kinesin family proteins crucial control microtubule length cell division- neuronal development interphase microtubule dynamics mechanism kinesin proteins depolymerize microtubules poorly understood central question proteins target microtubule ends rates exceeding standard enzyme-substrate kinetics address question developed single-molecule microscopy assay mcak founding member kinesin family show mcak moves along microtubule lattice one-dimensional 1d random walk mcak-microtubule interactions transient: average mcak molecule diffused s diffusion coefficient mu m s- although catalytic depolymerization mcak requires hydrolysis atp found diffusion transient transition three-dimensional diffusion 1d diffusion corresponds reduction dimensionality proposed search strategy dna enzymes find specific binding sites show mcak uses strategy target microtubule ends rapidly direct binding solution
