explaining color distributions globular cluster systems elliptical galaxies
colors globular clusters large elliptical galaxies bimodal generally taken evidence presence two cluster subpopulations different geneses however find nonlinear nature metallicity-to-color transformation coeval group old clusters unimodal metallicity spread can exhibit color bimodality models cluster colors indicate horizontal-branch stars main drivers behind empirical nonlinearity show scenario gives simple cohesive explanations key observations simplify theories elliptical galaxy formation
