trim5 innate immune sensor retrovirus capsid lattice 
trim5 ring domain-e3 ubiquitin ligase restricts infection human immunodeficiency virus hiv retroviruses immediately following virus invasion target cell cytoplasm antiviral potency correlates trim5 avidity retrovirion capsid lattice several reports indicate trim5 role signal transduction- precise mechanism restriction unknown demonstrate trim5 promotes innate immune signalling activity amplified retroviral infection interaction capsid lattice acting heterodimeric ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme ubc13-uev1a also known ube2n-ube2v1 trim5 catalyses synthesis unattached k63-linked ubiquitin chains activate tak1 also known map3k7 kinase complex stimulate ap nf kappa b signalling interaction hiv capsid lattice greatly enhances ubc13-uev1a-dependent e3 activity trim5 challenge retroviruses induces transcription ap nf-kappa b-dependent factors magnitude tracks trim5 avidity invading capsid finally tak1 ubc13-uev1a contribute capsid-specific restriction trim5 thus retroviral restriction factor trim5 two additional activities linked restriction: constitutively promotes innate immune signalling acts pattern recognition receptor specific retrovirus capsid lattice
