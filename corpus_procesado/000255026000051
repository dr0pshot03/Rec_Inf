nad synthase nmnat acts chaperone protect neurodegeneration 
neurodegeneration can triggered genetic environmental factors although precise cause often unknown many neurodegenerative diseases share common features protein aggregation age dependence recent studies drosophila uncovered protective effects nad synthase nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase nmnat activity-induced neurodegeneration injury induced axonal degeneration12 show nmnat overexpression can also protect spinocerebellar ataxia sca1 induced neurodegeneration suggesting general neuroprotective function nmnat protects neurodegeneration partly proteasome-mediated pathway manner similar heat shock protein hsp70 nmnat displays chaperone function biochemical assays cultured cells shares significant structural similarity known chaperones furthermore upregulated brain upon overexpression poly glutamine expanded protein recruited chaperone hsp70 protein aggregates results implicate nmnat stress response protein acts chaperone neuronal maintenance protection studies provide entry point understanding normal neurons maintain activity offer clues common mechanisms underlying different neurodegenerative conditions
