cortical rewiring information storage 
current thinking long-term memory cortex focused changes strengths connections neurons ongoing structural plasticity adult brain including synapse formation/elimination remodelling axons dendrites suggests memory also depend learning-induced changes cortical wiring diagram given cortex sparsely connected wiring plasticity provide substantial boost storage capacity although cost elaborate biological machinery slower learning
