selective blockade microrna processing lin28
micrornas mirnas play critical roles development dysregulation mirna expression observed human malignancies recent evidence suggests processing several primary mirna transcripts pri mirnas blocked posttranscriptionally embryonic stem cells embryonal carcinoma cells primary tumors show lin28 developmentally regulated rna binding protein selectively blocks processing pri let mirnas embryonic cells using vitro vivo studies found lin28 necessary sufficient blocking microprocessor mediated cleavage pri let mirnas results identify lin28 negative regulator mirna biogenesis suggest lin28 may play central role blocking mirna-mediated differentiation stem cells certain cancers
