force-clamp spectroscopy monitors folding trajectory single protein
used force-clamp atomic force micoscopy measure end-to-end length small protein ubiquitin folding reaction single-molecule level ubiquitin first unfolded extended high force stretching force quenched protein folding observed folding trajectories continuous marked several distinct stages time taken fold dependent contour length unfolded protein stretching force applied folding folding collapse marked large fluctuations end-to-end length protein fluctuations vanished upon final folding contraction direct observations complete folding trajectory protein provide benchmark determine physical basis folding reaction
