dcc constrains tumour progression via dependence receptor activity
role deleted colorectal carcinoma dcc tumour suppressor matter debate past years dcc gene expression lost markedly reduced majority advanced colorectal cancers functioning dependence receptor dcc shown induce apoptosis unless engaged ligand netrin ref however far animal model supported view dcc loss-of-function causally implicated predisposing aggressive cancer development investigate role dcc-induced apoptosis control tumour progression created mouse model pro-apoptotic activity dcc genetically silenced although loss dcc-induced apoptosis mouse model associated major disorganization intestines leads spontaneous intestinal neoplasia relatively low frequency loss dcc-induced apoptosis also associated increase number aggressiveness intestinal tumours predisposing apc mutant context resulting development highly invasive adenocarcinomas results demonstrate dcc functions tumour suppressor via ability trigger tumour cell apoptosis
