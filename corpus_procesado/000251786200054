stochastic gene expression out-of-steady-state cyanobacterial circadian clock
recent advances measuring gene expression single cell level highlighted stochastic nature messenger rna protein synthesis- stochastic gene expression creates source variability abundance cellular components even among isogenic cells exposed identical environment recent integrated experimental modelling studies- shed light molecular sources variability however many studies focus systems reached steady state therefore address large class dynamic phenomena including oscillatory gene expression develop general protocol analysing predicting stochastic gene expression systems never reach steady states use framework analyse experimentally stochastic expression genes driven synechococcus elongatus circadian clock find although average expression two points circadian cycle separated hours identical variability two time points can different show general feature steady state systems demonstrate intrinsic noise sources owing random births deaths mrnas proteins extrinsic noise sources introduce fluctuations rate constants affect cell cell variability distinguish experimentally sources measured correlation expression fluctuations two identical genes modulated circadian cycle quantitative framework generally applicable steady state system will necessary understanding fidelity dynamic cellular systems
