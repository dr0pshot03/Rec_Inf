stepwise chromatin remodelling cascade transcription initiation non-coding rnas 
recent transcriptome analyses using high density tiling arrays- data large scale analyses full length complementary dna libraries fantom3 consortium demonstrate many transcripts non coding rnas ncrnas transcriptome analyses indicate many non coding regions previously thought functionally inert actually transcriptionally active regions various features furthermore relatively large several kilobases polyadenylated messenger rna transcripts transcribed regions harbouring little coding potential however function ncrnas mostly unknown matter debate show rna polymerase ii rnapii transcription ncrnas required chromatin remodelling fission yeast schizosaccharomyces pombe fbp1+ locus transcriptional activation chromatin fbp1+ progressively converted open configuration several species ncrnas transcribed fbp1+ coupled translocation rnapii region upstream eventual fbp1+ transcriptional start site insertion transcription terminator upstream region abolishes cascade transcription ncrnas progressive chromatin alteration results demonstrate transcription promoter region required make dna sequences accessible transcriptional activators rnapii
