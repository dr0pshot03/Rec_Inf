quantum mechanics mechanically detecting avoiding quantum fluctuations microwave field 
quantum fluctuations light field used continuous position detection produce stochastic back-action forces ultimately limit sensitivity overcome limit back-action forces can avoided giving complete knowledge motion types measurements called "back-action evading" "quantum nondemolition" detection present continuous two-tone back-action evading measurements superconducting electromechanical device realizing three long-standing goals: detection back-action forces due quantum noise microwave field reduction quantum back-action noise +/ decibels db measurement imprecision single quadrature motion +/ db mechanical zero-point fluctuations measurements type will find utility ultrasensitive measurements weak forces nonclassical states motion
