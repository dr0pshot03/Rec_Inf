pancreatic beta cell enhancers regulate rhythmic transcription genes controlling insulin secretion
mammalian transcription factors clock bmal1 essential components molecular clock coordinate behavior metabolism solar cycle genetic environmental perturbation circadian cycles contributes metabolic disorders including type diabetes study impact cell-autonomous clock pancreatic beta cell function examined pancreatic islets mice either intact disrupted bmal1 expression throughout life limited adulthood found pronounced oscillation insulin secretion synchronized expression genes encoding secretory machinery signaling factors regulate insulin release clock/bmal1 colocalized pancreatic transcription factor pdx1 within active enhancers distinct controlling rhythmic metabolic gene networks liver also found beta cell clock ablation adult mice caused severe glucose intolerance thus cell type-specific enhancers underlie circadian control peripheral metabolism throughout life may help explain dysregulation diabetes
