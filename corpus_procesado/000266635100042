superconductivity two-dimensional limit
superconductivity extreme two-dimensional limit studied ultrathin lead films two atomic layers single channel quantum well states exists scanning tunneling spectroscopy reveals local superconducting order remains robust two atomic layers transition temperature abruptly plunges lower value depending sensitively exact atomic structure film result shows cooper pairs can still form last two-dimensional channel electron states although binding strongly affected substrate
