dinosaur physiology evidence mesothermy dinosaurs
dinosaurs ectotherms fast-metabolizing endotherms whose activities unconstrained temperature date strongest evidence endothermy comes rapid growth rates derived analysis fossil bones however studies constrained lack comparative data appropriate energetic framework compile data ontogenetic growth extant fossil vertebrates including major dinosaur clades using metabolic scaling approach find growth metabolic rates follow theoretical predictions across clades although groups deviate moreover effects size temperature considered dinosaur metabolic rates intermediate endotherms ectotherms closest extant mesotherms results suggest modern dichotomy endothermic versus ectothermic overly simplistic
