plastic deformation reversible peak broadening nanocrystalline nickel
plastic deformation coarse-grained metals governed dislocation-mediated processes processes lead accumulation residual dislocation network producing inhomogeneous strain irreversible broadening bragg peaks x-ray diffraction show plastic deformation electrodeposited nanocrystalline nickel peak broadening reversible upon unloading hence deformation process build residual dislocation network results obtained situ peak pro le analysis using swiss light source situ technique based well-known peak pro le analysis methods can used address relationship microstructure mechanical properties nanostructured materials
