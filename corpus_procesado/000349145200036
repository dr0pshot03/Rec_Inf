nanoscale temperature mapping operating microelectronic devices
modern microelectronic devices nanoscale features dissipate power nonuniformly fundamental physical limits frustrate efforts detect resulting temperature gradients contact thermometers disturb temperature small system radiation thermometers struggle beat diffraction limit exploiting physics fahrenheits glass-bulb thermometer mapped thermal expansion joule-heated nanometer-thick aluminum wires precisely measuring changes density scanning transmission electron microscope electron energy loss spectroscopy quantified local density via energy aluminums bulk plasmon rescaling density temperature yields maps statistical precision kelvin/hertz-/ accuracy % nanometer-scale resolution many common metals semiconductors sufficiently sharp plasmon resonances serve thermometers
