lack long-term cortical reorganization macaque retinal lesions
several aspects cortical organization thought remain plastic adulthood allowing cortical sensorimotor maps modified continuously experience dynamic nature cortical circuitry important learning well repair injury nervous system electrophysiology studies suggest adult macaque primary visual cortex v1 undergoes large-scale reorganization within months retinal lesioning issue conclusively settled applied technique functional magnetic resonance imaging fmri detect changes cortical topography macaque area v1 binocular retinal lesions fmri allows non-invasive vivo long-term monitoring cortical activity wide field view sampling signals multiple neurons per unit cortical area show contrast previous studies adult macaque v1 approach normal responsivity months follow-up retinal lesions topography change electrophysiology experiments corroborated fmri results indicates adult macaque v1 limited potential reorganization months following retinal injury
