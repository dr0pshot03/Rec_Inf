gravity modes way distinguish hydrogen helium-burning red giant stars 
red giants evolved stars exhausted supply hydrogenin cores instead burn hydrogen surrounding shell12 red giant sufficiently evolved helium core also undergoes fusion3 outstanding issues understanding red giants include uncertainties amount mass lost surface helium ignition amount internal mixing rotation processes4 progress hampered inability distinguish red giants burning helium core still burning hydrogen shell asteroseismology offers way forward powerful tool probing internal structures stars using natural oscillation frequencies5 report observations gravity-mode period spacings red giants6 permit distinction evolutionary stages made use high-precision photometry obtained kepler spacecraft year measure oscillations several hundred red giants find many stars whose dipole modes show sequences approximately regular period spacings stars fall two clear groups allowing us distinguish unambiguously hydrogen-shell-burning stars period spacing mostly similar seconds also burning helium period spacing similar seconds
