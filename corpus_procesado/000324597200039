control surface charges radicals principle antistatic polymers protecting electronic circuitry 
even minute quantities electric charge accumulating polymer surfaces can cause shocks explosions multibillion-dollar losses electronic circuitry paper demonstrates remove static electricity necessary "target" charges instead way discharge polymer remove radicals surface radicals colocalize stabilize charges; scavenged surfaces discharge rapidly radical-charge interplay allows controlling static electricity doping common polymers small amounts radical-scavenging molecules including familiar vitamin e effectiveness approach demonstrated rendering common polymers dust-mitigating also using coatings prevent failure electronic circuitry
