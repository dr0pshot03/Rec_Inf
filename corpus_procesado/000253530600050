bold responses reflecting dopaminergic signals human ventral tegmental area
current theories hypothesize dopamine neuronal firing encodes reward prediction errors although studies nonhuman species provide direct support theory functional magnetic resonance imaging fmri studies humans focused brain areas targeted dopamine neurons [ ventral striatum vstr] rather brainstem dopaminergic nuclei [ ventral tegmental area vta substantia nigra] used fmri tailored directly image brainstem primary rewards used experiment vta blood oxygen level dependent bold response reflected positive reward prediction error whereas vstr encoded positive negative reward prediction errors monetary gains losses used vta bold responses reflected positive reward prediction errors modulated probability winning detected significant vta bold response nonrewarding events
