vibrationally quantum-state-specific reaction dynamics h atom abstraction cn radical solution 
solvent collisions can often mask initial disposition energy products solution-phase chemical reactions show transient infrared absorption spectra obtained picosecond time resolution nascent hcn products reaction cn radicals cyclohexane chlorinated organic solvents exhibit preferential excitation one quantum c-h stretching mode two quanta bending mode time scales approximately picoseconds hcn products undergo relaxation vibrational ground state coupling solvent bath comparison reactions cn radicals alkanes gas phase known produce hcn greater c-h stretch bending mode excitation two approximately six quanta respectively indicates partial damping nascent product vibrational motion solvent transient infrared spectra therefore probe solvent-induced modifications reaction free energy surface chemical dynamics
