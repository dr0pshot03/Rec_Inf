allowable carbon emissions lowered multiple climate targets 
climate targets designed inform policies limit magnitude impacts climate change caused anthropogenic emissions greenhouse gases substances target currently recognized world governments places limit two degrees celsius global mean warming since preindustrial times require large sustained reductions carbon dioxide emissions twenty-first century beyond- global temperature target however sufficient control many quantities transient sea level rise ocean acidification net primary production land using earth system model intermediate complexity emic observation-informed bayesian approach show allowable carbon emissions substantially reduced multiple climate targets set take account uncertainties physical carbon cycle model parameters radiative efficiencies climate sensitivity carbon cycle feedbacks along large set observational constraints within framework explore broad range economically feasible greenhouse gas scenarios integrated assessment community- determine likelihood meeting combination specific global regional targets various assumptions given likelihood meeting set targets allowable cumulative emissions greatly reduced inferred temperature target alone therefore temperature targets alone unable comprehensively limit risks anthropogenic emissions
