physical map chicken genome 
strategies assembling large complex genomes evolved include combination whole-genome shotgun sequencing hierarchal map-assisted sequencing whole-genome maps types can aid genome assemblies generally starting low-resolution cytogenetic maps ending highest resolution sequence fingerprint clone maps based upon complete restriction enzyme digests clones representative target genome ultimately comprise near-contiguous path clones across genome clone-based maps used validate sequence assembly order supply long-range linking information assembled sequences anchor sequences genetic map provide templates closing gaps fingerprint maps also critical resource subsequent functional genomic studies provide redundant ordered sampling genome clones accompanying paper describe draft genome sequence chicken gallus gallus first species sequenced model organism global food source present clone-based physical map chicken genome fold coverage containing contigs overlapping clones map represents approximately % chicken genome enables identification chicken clones aligned positions sequenced genomes
