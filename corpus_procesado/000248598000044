low beta diversity herbivorous insects tropical forests 
recent advances understanding insect communities tropical forests contributed little knowledge large-scale patterns insect diversity incomplete taxonomic knowledge many tropical species hinders mapping distribution records impedes understanding global biodiversity patterns explains tropical insects under-represented conservation biology study approximately species three herbivorous guilds feeding foliage caterpillars lepidoptera wood ambrosia beetles coleoptera fruit fruitflies diptera found low rate change species composition beta diversity across square kilometres contiguous lowland rainforest papua new guinea species widely distributed caterpillars feeding large plant genera species fed multiple host species even locally restricted plant species support endemic herbivores large plant genera represented continuously distributed resource easily colonized moths butterflies hundreds kilometres low beta diversity also documented groups differing host specificity fruitflies ambrosia beetles suggesting dispersal limitation substantial role shaping distribution insect species new guinea lowland rainforests similar patterns low beta diversity can expected tropical lowland rainforests typically situated extensive low basins major tropical rivers similar sepik-ramu region new guinea studied
