free-standing single-atom-thick iron membranes suspended graphene pores
excess surface dangling bonds makes formation free-standing two-dimensional 2d metals unstable hence difficult achieve date reports demonstrated 2d metal formation substrates show free-standing crystalline single-atom-thick layer iron fe using situ low-voltage aberration-corrected transmission electron microscopy supporting image simulations first-principles calculations confirm enhanced magnetic properties single-atom-thick 2d fe membranes work pave way new 2d structures formed graphene membranes
