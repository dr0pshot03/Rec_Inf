atom interferometer measurement newtonian constant gravity 
measured newtonian constant gravity g using gravity gradiometer based atom interferometry gradiometer measures differential acceleration two samples laser-cooled cs atoms change gravitational field along one dimension measured well-characterized pb mass displaced report value g x cubic meters per kilogram second squared standard error mean +/ x - systematic error +/ x - cubic meters per kilogram second squared possibility unknown systematic errors still exist traditional measurements makes important measure g independent methods
