ultraviolet surprise: efficient soft x-ray high-harmonic generation multiply ionized plasmas
high-harmonic generation universal response matter strong femtosecond laser fields coherently upconverting light much shorter wavelengths optimizing conversion laser light soft x-rays typically demands trade-off two competing factors reduced quantum diffusion radiating electron wave function emission species highest short-wavelength ultraviolet driving laser used however phase matching-the constructive addition x-ray waves large number atoms-favors longer-wavelength mid-infrared lasers identified regime high-harmonic generation driven cycle ultraviolet lasers waveguides can generate bright beams soft x-ray region spectrum photon energies electron volts surprisingly high ultraviolet refractive indices neutral atoms ions enabled effective phase matching even multiply ionized plasma observed harmonics narrow linewidths calculations show x-rays emerge nearly time-bandwidth-limited pulse trains similar attoseconds
