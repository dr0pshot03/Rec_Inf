gastrin-releasing peptide receptor mediates itch sensation spinal cord 
itching pruritus defined unpleasant cutaneous sensation serves physiological self-protective mechanism prevent body hurt harmful external agents chronic itch represents significant clinical problem resulting renal diseases liver diseases well several serious skin diseases atopic dermatitis- identity itch-specific mediator central nervous system however remains elusive describe gastrin-releasing peptide receptor grpr plays important part mediating itch sensation dorsal spinal cord found gastrin-releasing peptide specifically expressed small subset peptidergic dorsal root ganglion neurons whereas expression receptor grpr restricted lamina dorsal spinal cord grpr mutant mice showed comparable thermal mechanical inflammatory neuropathic pain responses relative wild-type mice contrast induction scratching behaviour significantly reduced grpr mutant mice response pruritogenic stimuli whereas normal responses evoked painful stimuli moreover direct spinal cerebrospinal fluid injection grpr antagonist significantly inhibited scratching behaviour three independent itch models data demonstrate grpr required mediating itch sensation rather pain spinal level results thus indicate grpr may represent first molecule dedicated mediating itch sensation dorsal horn spinal cord thus may provide central therapeutic target antipruritic drug development
