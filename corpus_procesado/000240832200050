satellite gravity measurements confirm accelerated melting greenland ice sheet
using time-variable gravity measurements gravity recovery climate experiment grace satellite mission estimate ice mass changes greenland period april november correcting effects spatial filtering limited resolution grace data estimated total ice melting rate greenland +/ cubic kilometers per year mostly east greenland estimate agrees remarkably well recent assessment +/ cubic kilometers per year based satellite radar interferometry data grace estimates southeast greenland suggest accelerated melting since summer consistent latest remote sensing measurements
