ubiquitylation innate adaptive immunity 
protein ubiquitylation emerged key mechanism regulates immune responses much like phosphorylation ubiquitylation reversible covalent modification regulates stability activity localization target proteins ubiquitylation regulates development immune system many phases immune response including initiation propagation termination recent work shown several ubiquitin ligases help prevent immune system attacking self tissues dysfunction several ubiquitin ligases linked autoimmune diseases
