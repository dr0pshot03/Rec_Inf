efficient disruption small asteroids earths atmosphere 
accurate modelling interaction atmosphere incoming bolide complex task crucial determining fraction small asteroids actually hit earths surface semi-analytical approaches simplified problem considering impactor strengthless liquid-like object pancake models recently realistic model developed calculates motion aerodynamic loading ablation separate particle fragment disrupted impactor report results large number simulations use models develop statistical picture atmosphere-bolide interaction iron stony objects initial diameters similar to1 km show separated-fragments model predicts total atmospheric disruption much larger stony bodies previously thought addition data set > simulated impacts combined known pre-atmospheric flux asteroids diameters less km- elucidates flux small bolides earths surface estimate bodies > m diameter will impact every years
