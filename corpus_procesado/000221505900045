self-incompatibility triggers programmed cell death papaver pollen
sexual reproduction many angiosperm plants involves self-incompatibility si one important mechanisms prevent inbreeding si genetically controlled s-locus involves highly specific interactions pollination pollen pistil lands results rejection incompatible self pollen whereas compatible non-self pollen allowed fertilize plant papaver rhoeas s-proteins encoded stigma component s-locus interact incompatible pollen triggering ca2+-dependent signalling network- resulting inhibition pollen-tube growth programmed cell death pcd mechanism used many organisms destroy unwanted cells precisely regulated manner- show pcd triggered si s-specific manner incompatible pollen provides demonstration si system using pcd revealing novel mechanism prevent self-fertilization furthermore data reveal response biphasic rapid inhibition pollen-tube growth followed pcd involved later decision-making phase making inhibition irreversible
