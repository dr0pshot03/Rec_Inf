robots can adapt like animals
robots transformed many industries notably manufacturing power deliver tremendous benefits society search rescue disaster response health care transportation also invaluable tools scientific exploration environments inaccessible humans distant planets deep oceans major obstacle widespread adoption complex environments outside factories fragility whereas animals can quickly adapt injuries current robots think outside box find compensatory behaviour damaged: limited pre-specified self-sensing abilities can diagnose anticipated failure modes require pre-programmed contingency plan every type potential damage impracticality complex robots promising approach reducing robot fragility involves robots learn appropriate behaviours response damage current techniques slow even small constrained search spaces introduce intelligent trial and-error algorithm allows robots adapt damage less two minutes large search spaces without requiring self-diagnosis pre-specified contingency plans robot deployed uses novel technique create detailed map space high-performing behaviours map represents robots prior knowledge behaviours can perform value robot damaged uses prior knowledge guide trial-and-error learning algorithm conducts intelligent experiments rapidly discover behaviour compensates damage experiments reveal successful adaptations legged robot injured five different ways including damaged broken missing legs robotic arm joints broken different ways new algorithm will enable robust effective autonomous robots may shed light principles animals use adapt injury
