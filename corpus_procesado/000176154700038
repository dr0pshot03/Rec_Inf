recent breakup asteroid main-belt region 
present population asteroids main belt largely result many past collisions12 ideally asteroid fragments resulting impact event help us understand large-scale collisions shaped planets early epochs3- known asteroid fragment families however old therefore undergone significant collisional dynamical evolution since formation6 evolution masked properties original collisions report discovery family asteroids formed disruption event +/ million years ago subsequently undergone little dynamical collisional evolution67 identified fragments two large comparable size diameters similar to19 similar to14 km remainder exhibiting continuum sizes range - km low measured ejection velocities suggest gravitational reaccumulation collision may common feature asteroid evolution moreover data can used check numerical models larger-scale collisions8
