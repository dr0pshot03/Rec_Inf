recent breakup asteroid main-belt region
present population asteroids main belt largely result many past collisions ideally asteroid fragments resulting impact event help us understand large-scale collisions shaped planets early epochs- known asteroid fragment families however old therefore undergone significant collisional dynamical evolution since formation evolution masked properties original collisions report discovery family asteroids formed disruption event +/ million years ago subsequently undergone little dynamical collisional evolution identified fragments two large comparable size diameters similar to19 similar to14 km remainder exhibiting continuum sizes range km low measured ejection velocities suggest gravitational reaccumulation collision may common feature asteroid evolution moreover data can used check numerical models larger-scale collisions
