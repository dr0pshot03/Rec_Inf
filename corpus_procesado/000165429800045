concurrent density dependence independence populations arctic ground squirrels
population increases without limit processes prevent can operate either density-dependent way acting increasing severity increase mortality rates decrease reproductive rates density increases density-independent way ways simultaneously- however ecologists disagree two main reasons relative roles influences density-dependent density-independent processes determining population size first empirical studies showing processes operating simultaneously rare second time-series analyses long-term census data sometimes overestimate dependence using density-perturbation experiment- arctic ground squirrels show concurrent density-dependent density-independent declines weaning rates followed density-dependent declines overwinter survival hibernation two processes result strong density-dependent convergence experimentally increased populations control populations low stable levels
