functional relationship cytochrome c plastocyanin arabidopsis 
photosynthetic electron carriers important converting light energy chemical energy green plants although protein components electron transport chain largely conserved among plants algae prokaryotes thought major difference concerning soluble protein thylakoid lumen cyanobacteria eukaryotic algae plastocyanin cytochrome c mediate electron transfer cytochrome bf complex photosystem i1- contrast plastocyanin found play role higher plants widely accepted cytochrome c evolutionarily eliminated higher-plant chloroplasts report characterization cytochrome c-like protein arabidopsis referred atc6 atc6 functional cytochrome c localized thylakoid lumen electron transport reconstruction assay showed atc6 replaced plastocyanin photosynthetic electron transport process genetic analysis demonstrated neither plastocyanin atc6 absolutely essential arabidopsis growth development however plants lacking plastocyanin atc6 survive
