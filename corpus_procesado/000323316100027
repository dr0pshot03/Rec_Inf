glutamate receptor-like genes mediate leaf-to-leaf wound signalling 
wounded leaves communicate damage status one another poorly understood process long-distance signalling stimulates distal production jasmonates potent regulators defence responses using non-invasive electrodes mapped surface potential changes arabidopsis thaliana wounding leaf eight found membrane depolarizations correlated jasmonate signalling domains undamaged leaves furthermore current injection elicited jasmonoyl-isoleucine accumulation resulting transcriptome enriched rnas encoding key jasmonate signalling regulators among screened membrane protein mutant lines mutations several clade glutamate receptor-like genes glrs attenuated wound-induced surface potential changes jasmonate-response gene expression leaves distal wounds reduced glr3 glr3 double mutant work provides genetic basis investigating mechanisms long-distance wound signalling plants indicates plant genes related important synaptic activity animals function organ-to-organ wound signalling
