lynx1 cholinergic brake limits plasticity adult visual cortex
experience-dependent brain plasticity typically declines early critical period circuits established loss plasticity closure critical period limits improvement function adulthood mechanisms change brains plasticity remain poorly understood identified increase expression lynx1 protein mice prevented plasticity primary visual cortex late life removal molecular brake enhanced nicotinic acetylcholine receptor signaling lynx1 expression thus maintains stability mature cortical networks presence cholinergic innervation results suggest modulating balance excitatory inhibitory circuits reactivates visual plasticity may present therapeutic target
