evolution drosophila nuclear pore complex results multiple hybrid incompatibilities
speciation often involves evolution incompatible gene interactions cause sterility lethality hybrids populations called hybrid incompatibilities occur two functionally divergent loci show nucleoporin 160kda nup160 gene fruitfly drosophila simulans incompatible one factors d melanogaster x chromosome causing hybrid lethality nup160 encodes nuclear pore complex protein shows evidence adaptive evolution furthermore protein encoded nup160 directly interacts another hybrid lethality gene nup96 indicating least two lethal hybrid incompatibility genes evolved byproducts divergent coevolution among interacting components drosophila nuclear pore complex
