teleconvection: remotely driven thermal convection rotating stratified spherical layers
report discovery convective phenomenon found occur rotating spherical system inner convectively unstable fluid layer bounded corotating outer convectively stable fluid layer although convection thermally driven unstable interior resulting convective motions concentrate primarily stable outer region phenomenon term teleconvection suggests fluid motions observed surface planet jupiters alternating zonal winds may driven energy source located deep inside planet
