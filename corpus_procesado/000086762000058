cpg methylation maintained human cancer cells lacking dnmt1 
hypermethylation associated silencing tumour susceptibility genes several forms cancer however mechanisms responsible aberrant methylation poorly understood prototypic dna methyltransferase dnmt1 widely assumed responsible methylation human genome including abnormal methylation found cancers test hypothesis disrupted dnmt1 gene homologous recombination human colorectal carcinoma cells show cells lacking dnmt1 exhibited markedly decreased cellular dna methyltransferase activity % decrease overall genomic methylation although juxtacentromeric satellites became significantly demethylated loci analysed including tumour suppressor gene p16ink4a remained fully methylated silenced results indicate dnmt1 unsuspected degree regional specificity human cells methylating activities dnmt1 can maintain methylation genome
