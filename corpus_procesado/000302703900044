topological transitions metamaterials
light-matter interactions can controlled manipulating photonic environment uncovered optical topological transition strongly anisotropic metamaterials results dramatic increase photon density states-an effect can used engineer interaction describe transition topology iso-frequency surface closed ellipsoid open hyperboloid use artificially nanostructured metamaterials show topological transition manifests increased rates spontaneous emission emitters positioned near metamaterial altering topology iso-frequency surface using metamaterials provides fundamentally new route manipulating light-matter interactions
