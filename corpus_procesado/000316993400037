solution release twisted dna chromosome replication coupled dna polymerases 
chromosomal replication machines contain coupled dna polymerases simultaneously replicate leading lagging strands however coupled replication presents largely unrecognized topological problem dna polymerase must travel helical path synthesis physical connection leading lagging-strand polymerases causes daughter strands entwine produces extensive build-up negative supercoils newly synthesized dna- dna polymerases maintain connection coupled replication despite topological challenges unknown examine dynamics escherichia coli replisome using ensemble single-molecule methods show replisome may solve topological problem independent topoisomerases find lagging-strand polymerase frequently releases okazaki fragment completion leaving single-strand gaps behind dissociation polymerase result loss replisome contact leading-strand polymerase behaviour referred signal release thought require protein possibly primase pry polymerase incompletely extended dna fragments- however observe signal release independent primase seem require protein trigger instead lagging-strand polymerase simply less processive context replisome interestingly lagging-strand polymerase supplied primed dna trans uncoupling fork high processivity restored hence propose coupled polymerases introduce topological changes possibly accumulation superhelical tension newly synthesized dna cause lower processivity transient lagging-strand polymerase dissociation dna
