deacetylation p53 modulates effect cell growth apoptosis 
p53 tumour suppressor transcriptional factor whose activity modulated protein stability post-translational modifications including acetylation- mechanism acetylated p53 maintained vivo remains unclear show deacetylation p53 mediated histone deacetylase hdac1-containing complex also purified p53 target protein deacetylase complexes designated pid identical metastasis-associated protein mta2 identified component nurd complex- pid specifically interacts p53 vitro vivo expression reduces significantly steady-state levels acetylated p53 pid expression strongly represses p53-dependent transcriptional activation notably modulates p53-mediated cell growth arrest apoptosis results show deacetylation functional interactions pid/mta2-associated nurd complex may represent important pathway regulate p53 function
