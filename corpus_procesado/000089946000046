electronic structure solids competing periodic potentials 
electrons subject potential two incommensurate periods translational invariance lost periodic band structure expected however model calculations based nearly free one-dimensional electrons experimental results high-resolution photoemission spectroscopy quasi-one-dimensional material show dispersing band states signatures periodicities apparent band structures generated nonuniform distribution electronic spectral weight complex eigenvalue spectrum
