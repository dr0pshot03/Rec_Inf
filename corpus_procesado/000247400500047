influence phylogeny fungal community assembly ecosystem functioning
ecology seeks explain species coexistence functional consequences experimental tests mechanisms simultaneously account processes difficult used experimental mycorrhizal plant system test whether functional similarity among closely related species phylogenetic conservatism can drive community assembly ecosystem functioning communities constructed number fungal species year growth realized species richness highest starting species distantly related communities high realized species richness also stimulated plant productivity low realized species richness findings suggest phylogenetic trait conservatism can promote coexistence reduced competition distinct evolutionary lineages enhance ecosystem function functional complementarity among lineages
