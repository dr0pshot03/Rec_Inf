unproductive splicing sr genes associated highly conserved ultraconserved dna elements 
human mouse genomes share number long perfectly conserved nucleotide sequences termed ultraconserved elements1 whereas regions can act transcriptional enhancers upstream genes within genes less well understood particular function ultraconserved elements overlap alternatively spliced exons genes encoding rna-binding proteins unknown12 report every member human sr family splicing regulators highly ultraconserved elements alternatively spliced either alternative poison cassette exons containing early in-frame stop codons alternative introns untranslated region alternative splicing events target resulting messenger rnas degradation means rna surveillance pathway called nonsense-mediated mrna decay mouse orthologues human sr proteins exhibit unproductive splicing patterns three sr proteins previously shown direct splicing transcripts one known autoregulate expression coupling alternative splicing decay3-; results suggest unproductive splicing important regulation entire sr family find unproductive splicing associated conserved regions arisen independently different sr genes suggesting splicing factors may readily acquire form regulation
