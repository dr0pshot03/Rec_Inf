synthetic lipid membrane channels formed designed dna nanostructures 
created nanometer-scale transmembrane channels lipid bilayers means self-assembled dna-based nanostructures scaffolded dna origami used create stem penetrated spanned lipid membrane well barrel-shaped cap adhered membrane part via cholesterol moieties single-channel electrophysiological measurements found similarities response natural ion channels conductances order nanosiemens channel gating pronounced gating seen mutations single dna strand stem protruded channel single-molecule translocation experiments show synthetic channels can used discriminate single dna molecules
