genetic analysis genome-wide variation human gene expression 
natural variation gene expression extensive humans organisms variation baseline expression level many genes heritable component localize genetic determinants quantitative traits expression phenotypes humans used microarrays measure gene expression levels performed genome-wide linkage analysis expression levels genes large families approximately expression phenotypes significant evidence linkage specific chromosomal regions cis trans-acting loci regulate variation expression levels genes although act trans many gene expression phenotypes influenced several genetic determinants furthermore found hotspots transcriptional regulation significant evidence linkage several expression phenotypes coincides expression levels many genes share regulatory region significantly correlated combination microarray techniques phenotyping linkage analysis quantitative traits allows genetic mapping determinants contribute variation human gene expression
