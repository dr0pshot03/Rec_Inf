phase transitions dirac electrons bismuth 
dirac hamiltonian successfully describes relativistic fermions applies equally well electrons solids linear energy dispersion example bismuth graphene characteristic materials magnetic field less tesla suffices force dirac electrons lowest landau level resultant strong enhancement coulomb interaction energy moreover dirac electrons usually come multiple flavors valley degeneracy ingredients favor transitions collective state novel quantum properties large field using torque magnetometry investigated magnetization bismuth fields tesla report observation sharp field induced phase transitions state striking magnetic anisotropy consistent breaking threefold valley degeneracy
