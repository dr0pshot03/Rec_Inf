selective inhibition regulatory subunit protein phosphatase restores proteostasis 
many biological processes regulated selective dephosphorylation proteins protein serine-threonine phosphatases assembled catalytic subunits bound diverse regulatory subunits provide substrate specificity subcellular localization describe small molecule guanabenz bound regulatory subunit protein phosphatase ppp1r15a/gadd34 selectively disrupting stress-induced dephosphorylation subunit translation initiation factor eif2 alpha without affecting related ppp1r15b-phosphatase complex constitutive protein synthesis guanabenz prolonged eif2 alpha phosphorylation human stressed cells adjusting protein production rates levels manageable available chaperones favored protein folding thereby rescued cells protein misfolding stress thus regulatory subunits phosphatases drug targets property used restore proteostasis stressed cells
