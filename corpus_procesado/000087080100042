proximate humid dry regions jupiters atmosphere indicate complex local meteorology
models jupiters formation structure predict atmosphere enriched oxygen relative sun consequently water clouds present globally near bar pressure level past attempts confirm predictions led contradictory results- particular galileo probe revealed dry atmosphere entry site significant clouds depths exceeding bar level although entry site known relatively cloud-free contrast observed local dryness expected global wetness surprising analyse near-infrared around mu m observations jupiter spectral region can reveal water vapour abundance vertical cloud structure troposphere find humid extremely dry regions exist close proximity humid regions spatially correlated bright convective clouds extending deep water clouds visible atmosphere
