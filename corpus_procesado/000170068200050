force can overcome object geometry perception shape active touch
haptic touch perception normally entails active exploration object surfaces time called active touch- exploring shape object experience geometrical force cues example sliding finger across surface rigid bump finger moves bump opposed force whose direction magnitude related slope bump steeper bump stronger resistance geometrical force cues correlated commonly assumed shape perception relies object geometry alone show regardless surface geometry subjects identified located shape features basis force cues correlates using paradoxical stimuli example combining force cues bump geometry hole found subjects perceived bump conversely combining force cues hole geometry bump subjects typically perceived hole
