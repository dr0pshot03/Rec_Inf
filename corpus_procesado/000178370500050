immunity-related genes gene families anopheles gambiae
identified anopheles gambiae genes gene families implicated innate immunity detected marked diversification relative drosophila melanogaster immune-related gene families involved recognition signal modulation effector systems show marked deficit orthologs excessive gene expansions possibly reflecting selection pressures different pathogens encountered insects different life-styles contrast multifunctional toll signal transduction pathway substantially conserved presumably counterselection developmental stability representative expression profiles confirm sequence diversification accompanied specific responses different immune challenges alternative rna splicing may also contribute expansion immune repertoire
