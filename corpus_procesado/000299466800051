depth perception image defocus jumping spider 
principal eyes jumping spiders unique retina four tiered photoreceptor layers light different wavelengths focused lens appreciable chromatic aberration found photoreceptors deepest second-deepest layers contain green-sensitive visual pigment although green light focused deepest layer mismatch indicates second-deepest layer always receives defocused images contain depth information scene optical theory behavioral experiments revealed depth perception spider affected wavelength illuminating light affects amount defocus images resulting chromatic aberration therefore propose depth perception mechanism based much retinal image defocused
