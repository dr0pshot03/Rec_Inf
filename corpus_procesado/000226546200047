chd1 chromodomain links histone h3 methylation saga slik-dependent acetylation 
specific post-translational modifications histones influence many nuclear processes including gene regulation dna repair replication1 recent studies identified effector proteins recognize patterns histone modification transduce function downstream processes2 example histone acetyltransferases hats shown participate many essential cellular processes particularly associated activation transcription3 yeast saga spt-ada-gcn5 acetyltransferase slik saga-like two highly homologous conserved multi-subunit hat complexes preferentially acetylate histones h3 h2b deubiquitinate histone h2b identify chromatin remodelling protein chd1 chromo-atpase/helicase-dnabinding domain component saga slik findings indicate one two chromodomains chd1 specifically interacts methylated lysine mark histone h3 associated transcriptional activity furthermore slik complex shows enhanced acetylation methylated substrate activity dependent upon functional methyl-binding chromodomain vitro vivo study identifies first chromodomain recognizes methylated histone h3 lys possibly identifies larger subfamily chromodomain proteins similar recognition properties
