polymerase iv occupancy rna-directed dna methylation sites requires shh1
dna methylation epigenetic modification critical roles gene silencing development genome integrity arabidopsis dna methylation established domains rearranged methyltransferase drm2 targeted nucleotide small interfering rnas sirnas pathway termed rna-directed dna methylation rddm pathway requires two plant-specific rna polymerases: pol-iv functions initiate sirna biogenesis pol-v functions generate scaffold transcripts recruit downstream rddm factors understand mechanisms controlling pol-iv targeting investigated function sawadee homeodomain homolog shh1 pol-iv-interacting protein show shh1 acts upstream rddm pathway enable sirna production large subset active rddm targets shh1 required pol-iv occupancy loci also show shh1 sawadee domain novel chromatin-binding module adopts unique tandem tudor-like fold functions dual lysine reader probing unmethylated k4 methylated k9 modifications histone h3 tail finally show key residues within lysine-binding pockets shh1 required vivo maintain sirna dna methylation levels well pol-iv occupancy rddm targets demonstrating central role methylated h3k9 binding shh1 function providing first insights mechanism pol-iv targeting given parallels methylation systems plants mammals understanding early targeting step may aid ability control expression endogenous newly introduced genes broad implications agriculture gene therapy
