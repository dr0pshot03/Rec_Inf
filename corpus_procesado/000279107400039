palladium-catalyzed trifluoromethylation aryl chlorides 
trifluoromethyl group can dramatically influence properties organic molecules thereby increasing applicability pharmaceuticals agrochemicals building blocks organic materials despite importance substituent general method exists installment onto functionalized aromatic substrates current methods either require use harsh reaction conditions suffer limited substrate scope report palladium-catalyzed trifluoromethylation aryl chlorides mild conditions allowing transformation wide range substrates including heterocycles excellent yields process tolerates functional groups esters amides ethers acetals nitriles tertiary amines therefore applicable late-stage modifications advanced intermediates also prepared putative intermediates catalytic cycle demonstrated viability process
