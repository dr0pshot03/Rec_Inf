nucleotide-dependent bending flexibility tubulin regulates microtubule assembly
atomic structure tubulin polymerized straight protofilament clearly distinct curved conformation bound cellular depolymerizer nucleotide contents identical cases conformation gtp-containing intra-dimer interface indistinguishable gdp-containing inter-dimer contact present two structures corresponding start end points microtubule polymerization hydrolysis cycles illustrate consequences nucleotide state longitudinal lateral assembly absence depolymerizers gdp-bound tubulin shows distinctive intra-dimer inter-dimer interactions thus distinguishes gtp gdp interfaces cold-stable tubulin polymer non-hydrolysable gtp analogue gmpcpp containing semi-conserved lateral interactions supports model straightening longitudinal interfaces happens sequentially starting conformational change gtp binding straightens dimer enough formation lateral contacts non-tubular intermediate closure microtubule require gtp hydrolysis
