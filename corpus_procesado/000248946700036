electron-induced oxygen desorption tio2-2x1 surface leads self-organized vacancies
low-energy electrons strike titanium dioxide surface may cause desorption surface oxygen oxygen vacancies result irradiating tio2-2x1 surface electrons energy electron volts analyzed scanning tunneling microscopy cross section desorbing oxygen pristine surface found +/ x - square centimeters means initial electronic excitation converted atomic motion probability near unity o vacancy formed desorption cross sections nearest next-nearest oxygen neighbors reduced factors respectively site-specific desorption probability resulted one-dimensional arrays oxygen vacancies
