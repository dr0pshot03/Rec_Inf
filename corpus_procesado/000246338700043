image statistics perception surface qualities
world full surfaces looking can judge material qualities properties colour glossiness can help us decide whether pancake cooked patch pavement icy studies surface appearance emphasized textureless matte surfaces- real-world surfaces may gloss complex mesostructure now receiving increased attention- appearance results complex interplay illumination reflectance surface geometry difficult tease apart given image simple image statistics diagnostic surface properties sensible use them- show skewness luminance histogram skewness sub-band filter outputs correlated surface gloss inversely correlated surface albedo diffuse reflectance find evidence human observers use skewness similar measure histogram asymmetry making judgements surfaces image surface positively skewed statistics tends appear darker glossier similar surface lower skewness true whether skewness inherent original image introduced digital manipulation also find visual aftereffect based skewness: adaptation patterns skewed statistics can alter apparent lightness glossiness surfaces subsequently viewed suggest neural mechanisms sensitive skewed statistics outputs can used estimating surface properties
