naive primed pluripotent states retain distinct molecular properties yet limited knowledge exists state transitions regulated identify mettl3 n--methyladenosine ma transferase regulator terminating murine naive pluripotency mettl3 knockout preimplantation epiblasts naive embryonic stem cells depleted ma mrnas yet viable however fail adequately terminate naive state subsequently undergo aberrant restricted lineage priming postimplantation stage leads early embryonic lethality ma predominantly directly reduces mrna stability including key naive pluripotency-promoting transcripts study highlights critical role mrna epigenetic modification vivo identifies regulatory modules functionally influence naive primed pluripotency opposing manner
