characterization carbohydrate transporter symbiotic glomeromycotan fungi 
symbiotic relationships mycorrhizal fungi plants enormous impact terrestrial ecosystems common arbuscular mycorrhizas formed fungi belonging phylum glomeromycota arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi facilitate uptake soil nutrients plants exchange obtain carbohydrates thus representing large sink atmospheric plant-fixed co2 however carbohydrates transported symbiotic interface still unknown report characterization first known glomeromycotan monosaccharide transporter gpmst1 exploiting unique symbiosis glomeromycotan fungus geosiphon pyriformis cyanobacteria gpmst1 gene low gc content contains six introns unusual boundaries gpmst1 possesses twelve predicted transmembrane domains functions proton cotransporter highest affinity glucose mannose galactose fructose belongs yet uncharacterized phylogenetic monosaccharide transporter clade initial characterization new transporter family involved fungal symbiosis will lead better understanding carbon flows terrestrial environments
