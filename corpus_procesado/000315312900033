generation electron airy beams
within framework quantum mechanics unique particle wave packet exists form airy function counter-intuitive properties revealed propagates time space quantum probability wave packet preserves shape despite dispersion diffraction propagates along parabolic caustic trajectory even though force applied contradict newtons laws motion wave packet centroid propagates along straight line nearly years later wave packet known accelerating airy beam realized optical domain later generalized orthogonal complete family beams propagate along parabolic trajectories well beams propagate along arbitrary convex trajectories report experimental generation observation airy beams free electrons electron airy beams generated diffraction electrons nanoscale hologram- imprinted electrons wavefunction cubic phase modulation transverse plane highest-intensity lobes generated beams indeed followed parabolic trajectories directly observed non-spreading electron wavefunction self-heals restoring original shape passing obstacle holographic generation electron airy beams opens new avenues steering electronic wave packets like photonic counterparts wave packets can imprinted arbitrary shapes trajectories
