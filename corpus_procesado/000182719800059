unmasking s-phase-promoting potential cyclin b1
higher eukaryotes s phase m phase cell cycle triggered different cyclin-dependent kinases cdks example frog egg extracts cdk1-cyclin b catalyzes entry mitosis trigger dna replication two hypotheses can explain observation: either cdk1-cyclin b fails recognize key substrates s-phase-promoting counterparts activity somehow regulated prevent activating dna synthesis show cdk1-cyclin b1 cryptic s-phase-promoting abilities can unmasked relocating cytoplasm nucleus moderately stimulating activity subcellular localization vertebrate cdks control activity thus critical factors determining specificity
