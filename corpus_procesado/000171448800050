direct interaction arabidopsis cryptochromes cop1 light control development
arabidopsis seedling photomorphogenesis involves two antagonistically acting components cop1 hy5 cop1 specifically targets hy5 degradation via 26s proteasome dark direct physical interaction little known regarding light signals perceived photoreceptors transduced regulate cop1 arabidopsis two related cryptochromes cry1 cry2 mediating various blue/ultraviolet-a light responses show photoactivated cryptochromes repress cop1 activity direct protein-protein contact direct regulation primarily responsible cryptochrome-mediated blue light regulation seedling photomorphogenic development genome expression profile
