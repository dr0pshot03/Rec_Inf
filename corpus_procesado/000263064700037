large-scale pattern growth graphene films stretchable transparent electrodes 
problems associated large scale pattern growth graphene constitute one main obstacles using material device applications1 recently macroscopic scale graphene films prepared two dimensional assembly graphene sheets chemically derived graphite crystals graphene oxides23 however sheet resistance films found much larger theoretically expected values report direct synthesis large scale graphene films using chemical vapour deposition thin nickel layers present two different methods patterning films transferring arbitrary substrates transferred graphene films show low sheet resistance similar omega per square per cent optical transparency low temperatures monolayers transferred silicon dioxide substrates show electron mobility greater cm2 v- s- exhibit half integer quantum hall effect45 implying quality graphene grown chemical vapour deposition high mechanically cleaved graphene6 employing outstanding mechanical properties graphene7 also demonstrate macroscopic use highly conducting transparent electrodes flexible stretchable foldable electronics89
