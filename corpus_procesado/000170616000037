repeating deep earthquakes: evidence fault reactivation great depth 
identified three groups deep earthquakes showing nearly identical waveforms tonga stab relocation cross-correlation method shows cluster composed earthquakes along plane kilometers length earthquakes colocated demonstrating repeated rupture fault one pair events shows identical rupture complexity suggesting temporal spatial rupture pattern repeated recurrence intervals show inverse time distribution indicating strong temporal control fault reactivation runaway thermal shear instabilities may explain temporally clustered earthquakes similar waveforms located along slip zones weakened shear heating earthquake doublets occur within hours consistent events recurring thermal energy initial rupture can diffuse away
