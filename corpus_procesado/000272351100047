crystal structure bifunctional antibiotic simocyclinone d8 bound dna gyrase
simocyclinones bifunctional antibiotics inhibit bacterial dna gyrase preventing dna binding enzyme report crystal structure complex formed n-terminal domain escherichia coli gyrase subunit simocyclinone d8 revealing two binding pockets separately accommodate aminocoumarin polyketide moieties antibiotic close distinct quinolone-binding site consistent observations several mutations region confer resistance agents biochemical studies show individual moieties simocyclinone d8 comparatively weak inhibitors gyrase relative parent compound combination generates potent inhibitor results facilitate design drug molecules target unexploited binding pockets
