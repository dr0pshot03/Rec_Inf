delayed phenology reduced fitness associated climate change wild hibernator 
commonly reported ecological effects climate change shifts phenologies particular warmer spring temperatures leading earlier timing key events12 among animals however reports heavily biased towards avian phenologies whereas still know comparatively little seasonal adaptations mammalian hibernation show significant delay days per year -year period hibernation emergence date adult females wild population columbian ground squirrels alberta canada finding related climatic conditions study location: owing within-individual phenotypic plasticity females emerged later years lower spring temperature delayed snowmelt although significant annual trend spring temperature date snowmelt become progressively later owing increasing prevalence late-season snowstorms importantly years later emergence also associated decreased individual fitness consequently decline mean fitness population growth rate across past two decades results show plastic responses climate change may driven climatic trends increasing temperature may associated declines individual fitness hence population viability
