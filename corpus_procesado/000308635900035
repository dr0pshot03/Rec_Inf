rpn- determines c elegans longevity proteotoxic stress conditions 
organisms protect germ-cell lineages damage often considerable cost: limited metabolic resources become partitioned away maintenance soma leaving ageing somatic tissues navigate survival amid environment containing damaged poorly functioning proteins historically experimental paradigms limit reproductive investment result lifespan extension proposed germline-deficient animals might exhibit heightened protection proteotoxic stressors somatic tissues find forced re-investment resources germ line soma caenorhabditis elegans results elevated somatic proteasome activity clearance damaged proteins increased longevity activity associated increased expression rpn- subunit 19s proteasome foxo transcription factor daf- ectopic expression rpn- sufficient confer proteotoxic stress resistance extend lifespan indicating rpn- candidate correct deficiencies age-related protein homeostasis disorders
