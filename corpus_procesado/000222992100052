kif1a alternately uses two loops bind microtubules
motor protein kinesin moves along microtubules driven adenosine triphosphate atp hydrolysis however remains unclear kinesin converts chemical energy mechanical movement report crystal structures monomeric kinesin kif1a three transition-state analogs: adenylyl imidodiphosphate amp-pnp adenosine diphosphate adp-vanadate adp-alfx aluminofluoride complexes structures together known structures adp-bound state adenylyl-beta gamma-methylene diphosphate amp-pcp-bound state show kinesin uses two microtubule-binding loops alternating manner change interaction microtubules atp hydrolysis cycle loop l11 extended amp-pnp structure whereas loop l12 extended adp structure adp-vanadate displays intermediate structure conformational change two switch regions causes loops raised microtubule thus actively detaching kinesin
