division subtraction distinct cortical inhibitory networks vivo
brain circuits process information specialized neuronal subclasses interacting within network revealing interplay requires activating specific cells monitoring others functioning circuit use new platform two-way light-based circuit interrogation visual cortex vivo show computational implications modulating different subclasses inhibitory neurons sensory processing find soma-targeting parvalbumin-expressing pv neurons principally divide responses preserve stimulus selectivity whereas dendrite-targeting somatostatin-expressing som neurons principally subtract excitatory responses sharpen selectivity visualized vivo cell-attached recordings show division pv neurons alters response gain whereas subtraction som neurons shifts response levels finally stimulating identified neurons scanning many target cells reveals single pv som neurons functionally impact specific subsets neurons projection fields findings provide direct evidence inhibitory neuronal subclasses distinct complementary roles cortical computations
