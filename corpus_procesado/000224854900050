baf60c essential function baf chromatin remodelling complexes heart development 
tissue-specific transcription factors regulate several important aspects embryonic development must function context dna assembled higher-order structure chromatin enzymatic complexes swi/snf-like baf complexes remodel chromatin allow transcriptional machinery access gene regulatory elements show smarcd3 encoding baf60c subunit baf complexes expressed specifically heart somites early mouse embryo smarcd3 silencing rna interference mouse embryos derived embryonic stem cells causes defects heart morphogenesis reflect impaired expansion anterior/secondary heart field also results abnormal cardiac skeletal muscle differentiation intermediate reduction smarcd3 expression leads defects outflow tract remodelling reminiscent human congenital heart defects baf60c overexpressed cell culture can mediate interactions cardiac transcription factors baf complex atpase brg1 thereby potentiating activation target genes results reveal tissue-specific dose-dependent roles baf60c recruiting baf chromatin remodelling complexes heart-specific enhancers providing novel mechanism ensure transcriptional regulation organogenesis
