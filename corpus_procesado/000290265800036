observation orbital currents cuo
orbital currents proposed order parameter pseudo-gap phase cuprate high-temperature superconductors used resonant x-ray diffraction observe orbital currents copper-oxygen plaquette basic building block cuprate superconductors confirmation existence orbital currents important step toward understanding cuprates well materials lacking inversion symmetry magnetically induced multiferroics although observed antiferromagnetic state cupric oxide show orbital currents can occur even absence long-range magnetic moment ordering
