dna-fuelled molecular machine made dna 
molecular recognition complementary strands dna allows construction nanometre length scale example dna tags may used organize assembly colloidal particles12 dna templates can direct growth semiconductor nanocrystals3 metal wires4 structural material right dna can used make ordered static arrays tiles5 linked rings6 polyhedra7 construction active devices also possible-for example nanomechanical switch8 whose conformation changed inducing transition chirality dna double helix melting chemically modified dna induced optical absorption9 conformational changes caused binding oligonucleotides small groups shown change enzymatic activity ribozymes10- report construction dna machine dna used structural material also fuel machine made three strands dna form pair tweezers may closed opened addition auxiliary strands fuel dna; cycle produces duplex dna waste product
