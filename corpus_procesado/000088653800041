dna-fuelled molecular machine made dna 
molecular recognition complementary strands dna allows construction nanometre length scale example dna tags may used organize assembly colloidal particles dna templates can direct growth semiconductor nanocrystals metal wires structural material right dna can used make ordered static arrays tiles linked rings polyhedra construction active devices also possible-for example nanomechanical switch whose conformation changed inducing transition chirality dna double helix melting chemically modified dna induced optical absorption conformational changes caused binding oligonucleotides small groups shown change enzymatic activity ribozymes- report construction dna machine dna used structural material also fuel machine made three strands dna form pair tweezers may closed opened addition auxiliary strands fuel dna cycle produces duplex dna waste product
