dna-mediated nanoparticle crystallization wulff polyhedra
crystallization fundamental ubiquitous process much studied centuries although crystallization atoms fairly well understood remains challenging predict reliably outcome molecular crystallization processes complicated various molecular interactions solvent involvement difficulty also applies nanoparticles: high-quality three-dimensional crystals- mostly produced using drying sedimentation techniques often impossible rationalize control give desired crystal symmetry lattice spacing habit crystal shape principle dna-mediated assembly nanoparticles offers ideal opportunity studying nanoparticle crystallization-: well-defined set rules developed target desired lattice symmetries lattice constants occurrence features grain boundaries twinning dna superlattices traditional crystals comprised molecular atomic building blocks suggests similar principles govern crystallization presence charged biomolecules interparticle spacings tens nanometres realization far polycrystalline dna-interconnected nanoparticle superlattices suggest dna-guided crystallization may differ traditional crystal growth show slow cooling several days solutions complementary-dna-modified nanoparticles melting temperature system gives thermodynamic product specific uniform crystal habit find nanoparticle assemblies wulff equilibrium crystal structure predicted theoretical considerations molecular dynamics simulations thus establishing dna hybridization can direct nanoparticle assembly along pathway mimics atomic crystallization
