signaling specificity frizzled receptors drosophila
wnt-frizzled fz signaling pathways play recurring important roles development homeostasis vertebrates invertebrates fz receptors can signal beta-catenin-dependent independent pathways drosophila fr fz2 redundant receptors wg addition fz conveys signals distinct pathway organize planar polarization epithelial structures demonstrate cytoplasmic sequences fz2 fz preferentially activate beta-catenin planar polarity cascade respectively receptors activate either pathway different efficiencies intrinsic differences signaling efficiency closely related receptors might general mechanism generating signaling specificity vivo
