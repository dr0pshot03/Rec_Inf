flk1-positive cells derived embryonic stem cells serve vascular progenitors 
interaction endothelial cells mural cells pericytes vascular smooth muscle essential vascular development maintenance- endothelial cells arise flk1-expressing flk1+ mesoderm cells whereas mural cells believed derive mesoderm neural crest epicardial cells migrate form vessel wall- difficulty preparing pure populations lineages hampered dissection mechanisms underlying vascular formation show flk1+ cells derived embryonic stem cells can differentiate endothelial mural cells can reproduce vascular organization process vascular endothelial growth factor promotes endothelial cell differentiation whereas mural cells induced platelet-derived growth factor-bb vascular cells derived flk1+ cells can organize vessel-like structures consisting endothelial tubes supported mural cells three-dimensional culture injection flk1+ cells chick embryos showed can incorporate endothelial mural cells contribute developing vasculature vivo findings indicate flk1+ cells can act `vascular progenitor cells form mature vessels thus offer potential tissue engineering vascular system
