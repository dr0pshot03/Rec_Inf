close halo large transparent grains around extreme red giant stars 
intermediate-mass star ends life ejecting bulk envelope slow dense wind- stellar pulsations thought elevate gas altitude cool enough condensation dust accelerated radiation pressure entraining gas driving wind explaining amount mass loss however problem difficulty observing tenuous gas dust tens milliarcseconds star reason consensus way sufficient momentum transferred light star outflow report spatially resolved multiwavelength observations circumstellar dust shells three stars asymptotic giant branch hertzsprung-russell diagram imaged scattered light dust shells found remarkably small radii less two stellar radii unexpectedly large grains nanometres radius proximity photosphere argues dust species transparent light star therefore resistant sublimation intense radiation field although transparency usually implies insufficient radiative pressure drive wind radiation field can accelerate large grains photon scattering rather absorption-a plausible mass loss mechanism lower-amplitude pulsating stars
