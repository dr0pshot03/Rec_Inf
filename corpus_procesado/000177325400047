est1p cell cycle-regulated activator telomere-bound telomerase 
saccharomyces cerevisiae telomerase components est2p tlc1 rna est1p est3p thought form complex acts late chromosome replication s phase upon recruitment cdc13p telomeric dna binding protein consistent model show est1p est2p cdc13p telomere-associated time however est2p est1p also binds telomeres late s phase cdc13 allele proposed defective recruitment yet est1p est2p telomere association persists cdc13 cells findings suggest model est1p binds telomeres late s phase interacts cdc13p convert inactive telomere-bound est2p active form
