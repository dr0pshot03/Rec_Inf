dna damage defines sites recurrent chromosomal translocations b lymphocytes 
recurrent chromosomal translocations underlie haematopoietic solid tumours origin ascribed selection random rearrangements targeted dna damage frequent nuclear interactions translocation partners; however relative contribution elements measured directly large scale examine role nuclear architecture frequency dna damage genesis chromosomal translocations measuring parameters simultaneously cultured mouse b lymphocytes absence recurrent dna damage translocations igh myc genes directly related contact frequency conversely translocations associated recurrent site-directed dna damage proportional rate dna break formation measured replication protein accumulation site damage thus non-targeted rearrangements reflect nuclear organization whereas dna break formation governs location frequency recurrent translocations including driving b-cell malignancies
