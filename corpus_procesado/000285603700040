can species remain unaltered long periods yet also undergo rapid diversification linking genetic variation phenotypic variation via environmental stress hsp90 protein-folding reservoir might promote stasis change however nature adaptive value hsp90-contingent traits remain uncertain ecologically genetically diverse yeasts find traits common frequently adaptive based preexisting variation causative polymorphisms occurring coding regulatory sequences alike common temperature stress alters phenotypes similarly selective inhibition hsp90 temperature stress increase correlations genotype phenotype system broadly determines adaptive value standing genetic variation influenced evolution current genomes
