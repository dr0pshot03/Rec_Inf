microstructured magnetic materials rf flux guides magnetic resonance imaging
magnetic resonance imaging spectroscopy systems use coils either singly arrays intercept radio-frequency rf magnetic flux regions interest often deep within body show new magnetic material offers novel possibilities guiding rf flux receiver coil permitting clear image obtained none might otherwise detectable new material contains microstructure designed according concepts taken field photonic band gap materials rf range magnetic permeability can produced specification exhibiting negligible direct-current magnetism latter property vital avoid perturbing static audio-frequency magnetic fields needed obtain image spectral data concept offers new paradigm manipulation rf flux nuclear magnetic resonance systems
