spatial architecture protein function adaptation 
statistical analysis protein evolution suggests design natural proteins sparse networks coevolving amino acids termed sectors comprise essence three-dimensional structure function- however proteins also subject pressures deriving dynamics evolutionary process itself-the ability tolerate mutation adaptive changing selection pressures- understand relationship sector architecture properties developed high-throughput quantitative method comprehensive single-mutation study every position substituted individually every amino acid using pdz domain psd95pdz3 model system show sector positions functionally sensitive mutation whereas non-sector positions tolerant substitution addition find adaptation new binding specificity initiates exclusively variation within sector residues combination just two sector mutations located near away ligand-binding site suffices switch binding specificity psd95pdz3 quantitatively towards class-switching ligand localization functional constraint adaptive variation within sector important implications understanding engineering proteins
