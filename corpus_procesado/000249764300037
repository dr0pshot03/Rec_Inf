synchrony dynamics initiation failure rescue segmentation clock 
"segmentation clock" thought coordinate sequential segmentation body axis vertebrate embryos clock comprises multicellular genetic network synchronized oscillators coupled intercellular delta-notch signaling synchrony established loss determines position segmentation defects delta notch mutants unknown analyzed clocks synchrony dynamics varying strength timing notch coupling zebrafish embryos techniques quantitative perturbation gene function developed physical theory based coupled phase oscillators explaining observed onset rescue segmentation defects clocks robustness developmental noise critical point beyond synchrony decays conclude synchrony among genetic oscillators can established simultaneous initiation self-organization segmentation defect position determined difference coupling strength noise
