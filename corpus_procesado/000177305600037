experimental evidence sub--fs charge transfer aromatic adsorbate semiconductor 
ultrafast timescale electron transfer processes crucial role many biological systems technological devices dye-sensitized solar cells- electron transfer photoexcited dye molecules nanostructured semiconductor substrates needs sufficiently fast compete effectively loss processes thus achieve high solar energy conversion efficiencies time-resolved laser techniques indicate upper limit femtoseconds- time needed inject electron dye semiconductor corresponds timescale competing processes charge redistribution intramolecular thermalization excited states- occur use resonant photoemission spectroscopy previously used monitor electron transfer simple systems order-of-magnitude improvement time resolution show electron transfer aromatic adsorbate tio2 semiconductor surface can occur less fs results directly confirm electronic coupling aromatic molecule substrate sufficiently strong suppress competing processes
