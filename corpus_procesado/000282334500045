crac channel activator stim1 binds inhibits l-type voltage-gated calcium channels
voltage-and store-operated calcium ca2+ channels major routes ca2+ entry mammalian cells little known cells coordinate activity channels generate coherent calcium signals found stim1 stromal interaction molecule main activator store-operated ca2+ channels directly suppresses depolarization-induced opening voltage-gated ca2+ channel cav stim1 binds c terminus cav ca2+ release-activated ca2+ activation domain acutely inhibits gating causes long-term internalization channel membrane establishes previously unknown function stim1 provides molecular mechanism explain reciprocal regulation two channels cells
