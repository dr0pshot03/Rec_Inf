atom-interferometry constraints dark energy 
dark energy drives accelerated expansion universe consists light scalar field might detectable fifth force normal-matter objects potential conflict precision tests gravity chameleon fields theories screening mechanisms however can evade tests suppressing forces regions high density laboratory using cesium matter-wave interferometer near spherical mass ultrahigh-vacuum chamber reduced screening mechanism probing field individual atoms rather bulk matter thereby constrained wide class dark energy theories including range chameleon theories reproduce observed cosmic acceleration
