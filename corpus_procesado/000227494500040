ultrafast memory loss energy redistribution hydrogen bond network liquid h2o 
many unusual properties liquid water attributed unique structure comprised random fluctuating three-dimensional network hydrogen bonds link highly polar water molecules one direct probes dynamics network infrared spectrum oh stretching vibration- reflects distribution hydrogen-bonded structures intermolecular forces controlling structural dynamics liquid indeed water dynamics studied detail- recently using multi-dimensional nonlinear infrared spectroscopy acquiring structural dynamical information femtosecond timescales owing technical difficulties oh stretching vibrations d2o od vibrations h2o monitored show using specially designed ultrathin sample cell allows us observe oh stretching vibrations h2o fully resonant conditions observe hydrogen bond network dynamics one order magnitude faster seen earlier studies include extremely fast sweep oh frequencies fs timescale equally fast disappearance initial inhomogeneous distribution sites results highlight efficiency energy redistribution within hydrogen-bonded network liquid water essentially loses memory persistent correlations structure within fs
