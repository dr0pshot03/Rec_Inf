electrostatic self-assembly binary nanoparticle crystals diamond-like lattice 
self-assembly charged equally sized metal nanoparticles two types gold silver leads formation large sphalerite diamond-like crystals nanoparticle four oppositely charged neighbors formation non-close-packed structures consequence electrostatic effects specific nanoscale thickness screening layer commensurate dimensions assembling objects electrostatic stabilization larger crystallizing particles smaller ones better-quality crystals can obtained polydisperse nanoparticle solutions
