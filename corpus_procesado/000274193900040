multiple native states reveal persistent ruggedness rna folding landscape 
according thermodynamic hypothesis sequence biological macromolecule defines folded active native structure global energy minimum folding landscape12 however enormous complexity folding landscapes large macromolecules raises question whether fact unique global minimum corresponding unique native conformation whether deep local minima corresponding alternative active conformations3 folding many proteins well described two-state models leading highly simplified representations protein folding landscapes single native conformation45 nevertheless accumulating experimental evidence suggests complex topology folding landscapes multiple active conformations can take seconds longer interconvert6- demonstrate using single-molecule experiments rna enzyme folds multiple distinct native states interconvert timescale much longer catalysis data demonstrate severe ruggedness rna folding landscapes extends conformational space occupied native conformations
