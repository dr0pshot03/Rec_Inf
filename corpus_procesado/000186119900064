cellular framework gut-looping morphogenesis zebrafish 
many vertebrate organs adopt asymmetric positions respect midline little known cellular changes tissue movements occur downstream left-right gene expression produce asymmetry provide evidence looping zebrafish gut results asymmetric migration neighboring lateral plate mesoderm lpm mutations disrupt epithelial structure lpm perturb asymmetric migration inhibit gut looping asymmetric lpm migration still occurs endoderm ablated gut-looping region suggesting lpm can autonomously provide motive force gut displacement finally reducing left-sided nodal activity randomizes pattern lpm migration gut looping results reveal cellular framework regulation organ laterality asymmetrically expressed genes
