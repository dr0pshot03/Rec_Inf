interface silicon high-k oxide 
ability semiconductor industry continue scaling microelectronic devices ever smaller dimensions trend known moores law limited quantum mechanical effects: thickness conventional silicon dioxide sio2 gate insulators reduced just atomic layers electrons can tunnel directly films continued device scaling will therefore probably require replacement insulator high-dielectric-constant high-k oxides increase thickness thus preventing tunnelling currents retaining electronic properties ultrathin sio2 film ultimately insulators will require atomically defined interface silicon without interfacial sio2 layer optimal performance following first reports epitaxial growth ao abo compounds silicon- formation atomically abrupt crystalline interface strontium titanate silicon demonstrated- however atomic structure proposed interface questionable requires silicon atoms coordinations rarely found elsewhere nature describe first-principles calculations formation interface silicon strontium titanate atomic structure study shows atomic control interfacial structure altering chemical environment can dramatically improve electronic properties interface meet technological requirements interface structure chemistry may provide guidance selection process high-k gate oxides controlling growth
