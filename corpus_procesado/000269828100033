mitochondrial gene replacement primate offspring embryonic stem cells
mitochondria found eukaryotic cells contain genome mitochondrial dna mtdna unlike nuclear genome derived egg sperm fertilization mtdna embryo derived almost exclusively egg maternal origin mutations mtdna contribute diverse range currently incurable human diseases disorders establish preclinical models new therapeutic approaches demonstrate mitochondrial genome can efficiently replaced mature non-human primate oocytes macaca mulatta spindle-chromosomal complex transfer one egg enucleated mitochondrial-replete egg reconstructed oocytes mitochondrial replacement capable supporting normal fertilization embryo development produced healthy offspring genetic analysis confirmed nuclear dna three infants born far originated spindle donors whereas mtdna came cytoplast donors contribution spindle donor mtdna detected offspring spindle replacement shown efficient protocol replacing full complement mitochondria newly generated embryonic stem cell lines approach may offer reproductive option prevent mtdna disease transmission affected families
