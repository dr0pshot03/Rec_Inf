rapid remobilization magmatic crystals kept cold storage 
processes involved formation storage magma within earths upper crust fundamental importance volcanology many volcanic eruptions including largest result eruption components stored tens hundreds thousands years eruption1- although physical conditions magma storage remobilization paramount importance understanding volcanic processes remain relatively poorly known45 eruptions crystal-rich magma often suggested require mobilization magma stored near-solidus conditions6-; however accumulation significant eruptible magma volumes also argued require extended storage magma higher temperatures7- lacking debate clear observational evidence linking thermal therefore physical conditions within magma reservoir timescales storage-that thermal histories present method constraining thermal histories combining timescales derived uranium-series disequilibria crystal sizes trace-element zoning crystals mount hood oregon usa small fraction total magma storage duration per cent probably much less per cent spent temperatures critical crystallinity - per cent magma easily mobilized partial data sets volcanoes also suggest similar conditions magma storage widespread therefore rapid mobilization magmas stored near-solidus temperatures common magma storage low temperatures indicates although thermobarometry calculations based mineral compositions may record conditions crystallization unlikely reflect conditions time magma stored results also suggest largely liquid magma bodies can imaged geophysically will ephemeral features therefore detection indicate imminent eruption
