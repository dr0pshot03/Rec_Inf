aquaporin membrane junctions reveal structure closed water pore
lens-specific water pore aquaporin aqp0 aquaporin known form membrane junctions vivo show aqp0 lens core containing carboxy-terminally cleaved aqp0 forms double-layered crystals recapitulate vivo junctions present structure aqp0 membrane junction determined electron crystallography junction formed three localized interactions aqp0 molecules adjoining membranes mainly mediated proline residues conserved aqp0s different species present aquaporins whereas previously determined aquaporin structures show pore open conformation- water pore closed aqp0 junctions water pathway aqp0 also contains additional pore constriction seen known aquaporin structures- may responsible pore gating
