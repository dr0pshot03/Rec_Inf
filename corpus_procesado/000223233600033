principle temperature-dependent gating cold heat-sensitive trp channels 
mammalian sensory system capable discriminating thermal stimuli ranging noxious cold noxious heat principal temperature sensors belong trp cation channel family mechanisms underlying marked temperature sensitivity opening closing gating channels unknown show temperature sensing tightly linked voltage-dependent gating cold-sensitive channel trpm8 heat-sensitive channel trpv1 channels activated upon depolarization changes temperature result graded shifts voltage-dependent activation curves chemical agonists menthol trpm8 capsaicin trpv1 function gating modifiers shifting activation curves towards physiological membrane potentials kinetic analysis gating different temperatures indicates temperature sensitivity trpm8 trpv1 arises tenfold difference activation energies associated voltage-dependent opening closing results suggest simple unifying principle explains cold heat sensitivity trp channels
