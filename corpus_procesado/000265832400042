experimental design method leading chemical turing patterns
chemical reaction-diffusion patterns often serve prototypes pattern formation living systems two isothermal single-phase reaction systems produced sustained stationary reaction-diffusion patterns far designed experimental method search additional systems basis three steps: generate spatial bistability operating autoactivated reactions open spatial reactors ii use independent negative-feedback species produce spatiotemporal oscillations iii induce space-scale separation activatory inhibitory processes low-mobility complexing agent successfully applied method hydrogen-ion autoactivated reaction thiourea-iodate-sulfite tuis reaction noticeably produced stationary hexagonal arrays spots parallel stripes ph patterns attributed turing bifurcation method extended biochemical reactions
