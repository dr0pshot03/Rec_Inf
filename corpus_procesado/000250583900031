piwi-pirna pathway provides adaptive defense transposon arms race
increasingly complex networks small rnas act rna-interference rnai pathways regulate gene expression mediate antiviral responses organize chromosomal domains restrain spread selfish genetic elements historically rnai defined response double-stranded rna however small rna species may arise double-stranded rna precursors yet like micrornas small interfering rnas species guide argonaute proteins silencing targets complementary base-pairing silencing can achieved corecruitment accessory factors activity argonaute often endonucleolytic activity specific adaptive regulatory system rnai used throughout eukarya indicates long evolutionary history likely function rnai throughout history protect genome pathogenic parasitic invaders
