spatially ordered dynamics bacterial carbon fixation machinery
cyanobacterial carbon fixation major component global carbon cycle process requires carboxysome organelle-like proteinaceous microcompartment sequesters enzymes carbon fixation cytoplasm fluorescently tagged carboxysomes found spatially ordered linear fashion consequence cells undergoing division evenly segregated carboxysomes nonrandom process mutation cytoskeletal protein para specifically disrupted carboxysome order promoted random carboxysome segregation cell division impaired carbon fixation disparate partitioning thus cyanobacteria use cytoskeleton control spatial arrangement carboxysomes optimize metabolic process carbon fixation
