origin hard x-ray emission galactic plane
galactic plane strong emitter hard x-rays kiloelectron volts emission forms narrow continuous ridge currently known hard x-ray sources far explain ridge x-ray emission fundamental question whether ridge emission ultimately resolved numerous dimmer discrete sources truly diffuse emission yet settled order obtain decisive answer using chandra x-ray observatory carried deepest hard x-ray survey galactic plane region devoid known x-ray point sources detected least new hard x-ray point sources addition strong diffuse emission within field view surface density point sources comparable high galactic latitudes effects galactic absorption considered therefore point sources probably extragalactic presumably active galaxies seen galactic disk galactic ridge hard x-ray emission diffuse indicates omnipresence within galactic plane hot plasma energy density one order magnitude higher substance interstellar space
