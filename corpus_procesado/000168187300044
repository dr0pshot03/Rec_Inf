fecundity-survival trade-offs parental risk-taking birds
life history theory predicts parents value survival offspring species higher probability adult survival fewer offspring report southern hemisphere birds higher adult survival smaller clutch sizes northern hemisphere birds subsequently manipulated predation risk adults versus offspring species paired north south america basis phylogeny ecology predicted southern parents responded strongly reduce mortality risk oven cost offspring whereas northern parents responded strongly reduce risk offspring even greater risk
