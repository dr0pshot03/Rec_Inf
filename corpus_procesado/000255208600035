small phonon contribution photoemission kink copper oxide superconductors
despite two decades intense research efforts origin high temperature superconductivity copper oxides remains elusive angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy experiments revealed kink dispersion relations energy versus wavevector electronic states copper oxides binding energies mev raising hope anomaly key understanding high temperature superconductivity kink often interpreted terms interactions electrons bosonic field although consensus nature bosons even whether boson model appropriate phonons spin fluctuations proposed possible candidates report first principles calculations role phonons electron phonon interaction photoemission spectra la2-xsrxcuo4 calculations within standard formalism demonstrate phonon induced renormalization electron energies fermi velocity almost one order magnitude smaller effect observed photoemission experiments therefore result rules electron phonon interaction bulk la2-xsrxcuo4 exclusive origin measured kink conclusions consistent reached independently recent study related compound yba2cu3o7
