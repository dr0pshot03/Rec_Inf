thermodynamics incommensurate quantum crystal
present theory thermodynamics incommensurate quantum solid ground state solid assumed incommensurate crystal quantum zero-point vacancies interstitials thus non-integer number atoms per unit cell show low temperature t variation net vacancy concentration t first correction specific heat due varies t- quite consistent experiments solid helium- also make observations recent experimental reports supersolidity solid helium motivate renewed interest quantum crystals
