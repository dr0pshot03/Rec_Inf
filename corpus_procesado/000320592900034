rapid assembly elliptical galaxy billion solar masses redshift 
stellar archaeology shows massive elliptical galaxies formed rapidly ten billion years ago star-formation rates several hundred solar masses per year progenitors probably submillimetre bright galaxies redshifts z greater although mean molecular gas mass x solar masses submillimetre bright galaxies can explain formation typical elliptical galaxies inadequate form elliptical galaxies already stellar masses x solar masses z approximate report multi-wavelength high-resolution observations rare merger two massive submillimetre bright galaxies z approximate system seen forming stars rate solar masses per year star-formation efficiency order magnitude greater normal galaxies gas reservoir will exhausted star formation will quenched around million years projected separation kiloparsecs two massive starbursts merge form passive elliptical galaxy stellar mass x solar masses conclude gas-rich major galaxy mergers intense star formation can form massive elliptical galaxies z approximate
