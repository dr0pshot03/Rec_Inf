social interactions among epithelial cells tracheal branching morphogenesis
many organs composed tubular networks arise branching morphogenesis cells bud epithelium organize tube- fibroblast growth factors fgfs signalling molecules shown guide branch budding outgrowth- known epithelial cells coordinate movements morphogenesis use genetic mosaic analysis drosophila melanogaster show two functionally distinct classes cells budding tracheal branches: cells tip respond directly branchless fgf lead branch outgrowth trailing cells receive secondary signal follow lead cells form tube roles pre-specified rather competition cells highest fgf receptor activity take lead positions whereas less fgf receptor activity assume subsidiary positions form branch stalk competition appears involve notch-mediated lateral inhibition prevents extra cells assuming lead may also cooperation budding cells mosaic epithelium cells respond chemoattractant respond poorly allow cells epithelium move ahead
