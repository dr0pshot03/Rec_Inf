plasminogen critical host pathogenicity factor group streptococcal infection 
group streptococci common human pathogen secrete streptokinase activates hosts blood clot-dissolving protein plasminogen streptokinase highly specific human plasminogen exhibiting little activity mammalian species including mouse transgene expressing human plasminogen markedly increased mortality mice infected streptococci susceptibility dependent bacterial streptokinase expression thus streptokinase key pathogenicity factor primary determinant host species specificity group streptococcal infection addition local fibrin clot formation may implicated host defense microbial pathogens
