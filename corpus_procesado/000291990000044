gametogenesis eliminates age-induced cellular damage resets life span yeast 
eukaryotic organisms age yet detrimental age-associated traits passed progeny life span reset one generation next known show budding yeast resetting life span occurs gametogenesis gametes spores generated aged cells show replicative potential gametes generated young cells age-associated damage longer detectable mature gametes furthermore transient induction transcription factor essential later stages gametogenesis extends replicative life span aged cells results indicate gamete formation brings rejuvenation eliminating age-induced cellular damage
