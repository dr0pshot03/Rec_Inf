organic-inorganic hybrid zeolites containing organic frameworks 
organic-inorganic hybrid zeolite materials containing organic framework synthesized partially superseding lattice oxygen atom methylene group use methylene-bridged organosilane silicon source gives zeolite materials containing organic group lattice zol several zeolitic phases mfi lta structures various characterization methods presence methylene frameworks si-ch2-si replace siloxane bonds si-o-si verified although si-c bonds partly cleaved give rise terminal methyl groups shape-selective lipophilicity zol material indicates physical mixture conventional zeolite amorphous organic-containing material contains genuine organic-inorganic hybrid zeolite
