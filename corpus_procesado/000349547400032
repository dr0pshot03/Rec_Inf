integrative analysis haplotype-resolved epigenomes across human tissues 
allelic differences two homologous chromosomes can affect propensity inheritance humans however extent differences human genome yet fully explored delineate allelic chromatin modifications transcriptomes among broad set human tissues enabled chromosome-spanning haplotype reconstruction strategy resulting large collection haplotype-resolved epigenomic maps reveals extensive allelic biases chromatin state transcription show considerable variation across tissues individuals allow us investigate cis-regulatory relationships genes control sequences analyses histone modification maps also uncover intriguing characteristics cis-regulatory elements tissue-restricted activities repetitive elements rich data sets described will enhance understanding mechanisms cis-regulatory elements control gene expression programs
