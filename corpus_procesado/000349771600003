defining mesenchymal progenitor niche single-cell resolution 
vertebrate organs composed epithelium surrounded support stromal tissues formed mesenchyme cells generally thought form organized progenitor pools use clonal cell labeling multicolor reporters characterize individual mesenchymal progenitors developing mouse lung observe diversity mesenchymal progenitor populations different locations movements lineage boundaries airway smooth muscle asm progenitors map exclusively mesenchyme ahead budding airways progenitors recruited tip pools differentiate asm around airway stalks; flanking stalk mesenchyme can induced form asm niche lateral bud airway tip plus focal wnt signal thus mesenchymal progenitors can organized localized carefully controlled domains rival epithelial progenitor niches regulatory sophistication
