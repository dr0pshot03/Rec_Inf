quantum simulation frustrated classical magnetism triangular optical lattices
magnetism plays key role modern technology stimulates research several branches condensed matter physics although theory classical magnetism well developed demonstration widely tunable experimental system remained elusive goal present realization large-scale simulator classical magnetism triangular lattice exploiting particular properties quantum system use motional degrees freedom atoms trapped optical lattice simulate large variety magnetic phases: ferromagnetic antiferromagnetic even frustrated spin configurations rich phase diagram revealed different types phase transitions results provide route study highly debated phases like spin-liquids well dynamics quantum phase transitions
