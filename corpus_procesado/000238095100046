noise-resistant synchronized oscillation segmentation clock
periodic somite segmentation vertebrate embryos controlled segmentation clock consists numerous cellular oscillators although properties single oscillator driven hairy negative-feedback loop investigated system-level properties segmentation clock remain largely unknown explore characteristics examined response normally oscillating clock zebrafish experimental stimuli using vivo mosaic experiments mathematical simulation demonstrate segmentation clock behaves coupled oscillator showing notch-dependent intercellular communication activity regulated internal hairy oscillator couples neighbouring cells facilitate synchronized oscillation furthermore oscillation phase individual oscillators fluctuates due developmental noise stochastic gene expression active cell proliferation intercellular coupling found crucial role minimizing effects noise maintain coherent oscillation
