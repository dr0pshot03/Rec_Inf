transient low-populated protein-folding intermediate atomic resolution 
proteins can sample conformational states critical function seldom detected directly low occupancies short lifetimes work used chemical shifts bond-vector orientation constraints obtained nuclear magnetic resonance relaxation dispersion spectroscopy concert chemical shift-based method structure elucidation determine atomic-resolution structure invisible folding intermediate small protein module: ff domain structure reveals non-native elements preventing formation native conformation carboxyl-terminal part protein consistent kinetics folding well-structured intermediate forms rapidly rearranges slowly native state approach introduces general strategy structure determination low-populated transiently formed protein states
