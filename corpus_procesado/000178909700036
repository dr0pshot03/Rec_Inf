chemical composition metal-deficient stars largely reflects composition gas formed old stars provide crucial clues star formation history synthesis chemical elements early universe local relics epochs otherwise observable high redshifts totally metal-free population iii stars found allow direct study pristine gas big bang earlier searches stars found none iron abundance less / sun leading suggestion low-mass stars form clouds critical iron abundance report discovery low-mass star iron abundance low / solar value discovery suggests population iii stars still exist-that first generation stars also contained long-lived low-mass objects previous failure find may observational selection effect
