acetylation histone h4 esa1 required dna double-strand break repair 
although acetylation histones well-documented regulatory role transcription- role chromosomal functions remains largely unexplored show distinct patterns histone h4 acetylation essential two separate pathways double-strand break repair budding yeast strain mutations wild-type h4 acetylation sites shows defects nonhomologous end joining repair newly described pathway replication-coupled repair pathways require esa1 histone acetyl transferase hat responsible acetylating h4 tail lysines including ectopic lysines restore repair capacity mutant h4 tail arp4 protein binds histone h4 tails part esa1-containing nua4 hat complex recruited specifically dna double-strand breaks generated vivo purified esa1-arp4 hat complex acetylates linear nucleosomal arrays far greater efficiency circular arrays vitro indicating preferentially acetylates nucleosomes near break site together data show histone tail acetylation required directly dna repair suggest related human hat complex may function similarly
