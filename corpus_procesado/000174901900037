optical studies solid hydrogen gpa evidence black hydrogen
quest metallic hydrogen high pressures represents longstanding problem condensed matter physics recent calculations- predicted solid hydrogen become molecular metal pressures gpa transforming alkali metal strong quantum nature problem makes predictions difficult decade ago optical study hydrogen made using diamond anvil cell reach gpa however despite many subsequent efforts quantitative studies- higher pressures proved difficult conclusions controversial report optical measurements solid hydrogen pressure gpa k vibron signature h molecule persists least gpa structural changes detected gpa solid hydrogen observed turn completely opaque gpa measure absorption edge hydrogen gpa observing features characteristic direct electronic bandgap odds recent theoretical calculations predict much larger direct transition energies closure indirect gap- predict metal hydrogen observed gpa direct gap closes
