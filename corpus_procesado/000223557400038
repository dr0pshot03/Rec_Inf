observation one-dimensional tonks-girardeau gas 
report observation one-dimensional 1d tonks-girardeau tg gas bosons moving freely 1d although tg gas bosons strongly interacting behave much like noninteracting fermions enter tg regime cold rubidium- atoms trapping combination two light traps changing trap intensities hence atomic interaction strength atoms can made act either like bose-einstein condensate like tg gas measure total d energy length gas free parameters wide range coupling strengths data fit exact solution ground state d bose gas
