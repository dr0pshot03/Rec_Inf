global warming elevational range shifts lowland biotic attrition wet tropics
many studies suggest global warming driving species ranges poleward toward higher elevations temperate latitudes evidence range shifts scarce tropics shallow latitudinal temperature gradient makes upslope shifts likely poleward shifts based new data plants insects elevational transect costa rica assess potential lowland biotic attrition range-shift gaps mountaintop extinctions projected warming conclude tropical lowland biotas may face level net lowland biotic attrition without parallel higher latitudes range shifts may compensated species lower latitudes high proportion tropical species soon faces gaps current projected elevational ranges
