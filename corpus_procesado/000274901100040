noise can induce bimodality positive transcriptional feedback loops without bistability
transcriptional positive-feedback loops widely associated bistability characterized two stable expression states allow cells respond analog signals digital manner using synthetic system budding yeast show positive feedback involving promoter multiple transcription factor tf binding sites can induce steady-state bimodal response without cooperative binding tf deterministic models system predict bistability rather bimodal response requires short-lived tf stochastic fluctuations tfs expression multiple binding sites provide fluctuations many promoters possess multiple binding sites many tfs unstable positive-feedback loops gene regulatory networks may exhibit bimodal responses necessarily deterministic bistability commonly thought
