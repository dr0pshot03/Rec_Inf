full-genome rnai profiling early embryogenesis caenorhabditis elegans 
key challenge functional genomics today generate well-annotated data sets can interpreted across different platforms technologies large-scale functional genomics data often fail connect standard experimental approaches gene characterization individual laboratories furthermore lack universal annotation standards phenotypic data sets makes difficult compare different screening approaches address problem screen designed identify genes required first two rounds cell division caenorhabditis elegans embryo used rna-mediated interference target % genes predicted c elegans genome combination differential interference contrast time-lapse microscopy systematic annotation resulting movies developed phenotypic profiling system shows high correlation cellular processes biochemical pathways thus enabling us predict new functions previously uncharacterized genes
