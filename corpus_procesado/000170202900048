practising orientation identification improves orientation coding v1 neurons 
adult brain shows remarkable plasticity demonstrated improvement fine sensorial discriminations intensive practice behavioural aspects perceptual learning well documented especially visual system1- specificity stimulus attributes clearly implicates early cortical site receptive fields retain fine selectivity attributes; however neuronal correlates simple visual discrimination task remained unidentified report electrophysiological correlates primary visual cortex v1 monkeys learning orientation identification link behavioural improvement type learning improved neuronal performance trained compared naive neurons improved long-term neuronal performance resulted changes characteristics orientation tuning individual neurons particularly slope orientation tuning curve measured trained orientation increased subgroup trained neurons likely code orientation identified monkey modifications tuning curve observed orientations monkey trained thus training induces specific efficient increase neuronal sensitivity v1
