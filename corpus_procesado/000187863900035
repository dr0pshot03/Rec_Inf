t-cell priming dendritic cells lymph nodes occurs three distinct phases
primary t-cell responses lymph nodes lns require contact-dependent information exchange t cells dendritic cells dcs lymphocytes continually enter leave normal lns resident lymphocyte pool composed nonsynchronized cells different dwell times display heterogeneous behaviour mouse lns vitro- employ two-photon microscopy vivo study antigen-presenting dcs naive t cells whose dwell time lns synchronized first h entering blood t cells underwent multiple short encounters dcs progressively decreased motility upregulated activation markers subsequent h t cells formed long-lasting stable conjugates dcs began secrete interleukin interferon-gamma second day coinciding onset proliferation t cells resumed rapid migration short dc contacts thus t-cell priming dcs occurs three successive stages: transient serial encounters first activation phase followed second phase stable contacts culminating cytokine production makes transition third phase high motility rapid proliferation
