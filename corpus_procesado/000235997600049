visualizing dislocation nucleation indenting colloidal crystals 
formation dislocations central understanding yield work hardening fracture fatigue crystalline materials dislocations studied extensively conventional materials recent results shown colloidal crystals offer potential model system visualizing structure dynamics directly real space although thermal fluctuations thought play critical role nucleation defects difficult observe directly nano-indentation small tip deforms crystalline film common tool introducing dislocations small volume initially defect-free- show analogue nano indentation performed colloidal crystal provides direct images defect formation real time single particle level allowing us probe effects thermal fluctuations implement new method determine strain tensor distorted crystal lattice measure critical dislocation loop size rate dislocation nucleation directly using continuum models elucidate relation thermal fluctuations applied strain governs defect nucleation moreover estimate although bond energies particles fifty times larger atomic systems difference attempt frequencies makes effects thermal fluctuations remarkably similar results also relevant atomic crystals
