pressure sensitivity olivine slip systems seismic anisotropy earths upper mantle 
mineral olivine dominates composition earths upper mantle hence controls mechanical behaviour seismic anisotropy experiments high temperature moderate pressure extensive data naturally deformed mantle rocks led conclusion olivine upper-mantle conditions deforms essentially dislocation creep dominant [ ] slip resulting crystal preferred orientation used extensively explain strong seismic anisotropy observed km depth- rapid decrease anisotropy depth interpreted marking transition dislocation diffusion creep upper mantle new high-pressure experiments suggest dislocation creep also dominates lower part upper mantle different slip direction show high-pressure dislocation creep produces crystal preferred orientations resulting extremely low seismic anisotropy consistent seismological observations km depth results raise new questions mechanical state lower part upper mantle coupling layers
