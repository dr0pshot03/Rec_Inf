selective d2 receptor actions functional circuitry working memory 
prefrontal neurons engaged working memory tasks express sequence phasic tonic activations linked train sensory mnemonic response-related events report dopamine d2 receptor selectively modulates neural activities associated memory-guided saccades oculomotor delayed-response tasks yet little effect persistent mnemonic-related activity instead modulated d1 receptors associates d2 receptor specific component working memory circuitry fractionates modulatory effects d1 d2 receptors neural machinery cognitive process
