microrna expression profiles classify human cancers 
recent work revealed existence class small non-coding rna species known micrornas mirnas critical functions across various biological processes use new bead-based flow cytometric mirna expression profiling method present systematic expression analysis mammalian mirnas samples including multiple human cancers mirna profiles surprisingly informative reflecting developmental lineage differentiation state tumours observe general downregulation mirnas tumours compared normal tissues furthermore able successfully classify poorly differentiated tumours using mirna expression profiles whereas messenger rna profiles highly inaccurate applied samples findings highlight potential mirna profiling cancer diagnosis
