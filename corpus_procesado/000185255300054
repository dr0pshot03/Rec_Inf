stem cell self-renewal can specified local signals surrounding microenvironment niche however relation niche mechanisms ensure correct balance stem cell self-renewal differentiation poorly understood show dividing drosophila male germline stem cells use intracellular mechanisms involving centrosome function cortically localized adenomatous polyposis coli tumor suppressor protein orient mitotic spindles perpendicular niche ensuring reliably asymmetric outcome one daughter cell remains niche self-renews stem cell identity whereas displaced away initiates differentiation
