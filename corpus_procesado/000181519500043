recent trends arctic surface cloud radiation properties space
trends satellite-derived cloud surface properties show arctic warmed become cloudier spring summer cooled become less cloudy winter increase spring cloud amount radiatively balances changes surface temperature albedo summer fall winter cloud forcing tended toward increased cooling implies seasonal cloud amounts changing surface warming even greater observed strong correlations arctic oscillation indicate rise surface temperature changes cloud amount related large-scale circulation rather local processes
