doppler spectroscopy path detection earth-like planets 
doppler spectroscopy first technique used reveal existence extrasolar planetary systems hosted solar-type stars radial-velocity surveys led detection rich population super-earths neptune-type planets numerous detected systems revealed remarkable diversity combining doppler measurements photometric observations planets transiting host stars provides access planet bulk density first step towards comparative exoplanetology development new high-precision spectrographs space-based facilities will ultimately lead us characterize rocky planets habitable zone close stellar neighbours
