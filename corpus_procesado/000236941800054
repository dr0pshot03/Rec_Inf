rna interference directs innate immunity viruses adult drosophila
innate immunity bacterial fungal pathogens mediated toll immune deficiency imd pathways little known antiviral response drosophila demonstrate rna interference pathway protects adult flies infection two evolutionarily diverse viruses work also describes molecular framework viral immunity viral double-stranded rna produced infection acts pathogen trigger whereas drosophila dicer argonaute act host sensor effector respectively findings establish drosophila model studying innate immunity viruses animals
