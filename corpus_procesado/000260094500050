phosphorylation networks regulating jnk activity diverse genetic backgrounds 
cellular signaling networks evolved enable swift accurate responses even face genetic environmental perturbation thus genetic screens may identify genes regulate different biological processes moreover although classical screening approaches succeeded providing parts lists essential components signaling networks typically provide much insight hierarchical functional relations exist among components describe high-throughput screen used rna interference systematically inhibit two genes simultaneously combinations identify regulators drosophila jun nh-terminal kinase jnk using genetic phosphoproteomics data implemented integrative network algorithm construct jnk phosphorylation network provides structural mechanistic insights systems architecture jnk signaling
