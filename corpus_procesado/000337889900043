valley hall effect mos2 transistors
electrons two-dimensional crystals honeycomb lattice structure possess valley degree freedom dof addition charge spin systems predicted exhibit anomalous hall effect whose sign depends valley index report observation so-called valley hall effect vhe monolayer mos2 transistors illuminated circularly polarized light preferentially excites electrons specific valley causing finite anomalous hall voltage whose sign controlled helicity light anomalous hall effect observed bilayer devices crystal inversion symmetry observation vhe opens new possibilities using valley dof information carrier next-generation electronics optoelectronics
