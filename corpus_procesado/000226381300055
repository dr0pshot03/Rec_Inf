evolutionary dynamics graphs
evolutionary dynamics traditionally studied context homogeneous spatially extended populations- generalize population structure arranging individuals graph vertex represents individual weighted edges denote reproductive rates govern often individuals place offspring adjacent vertices homogeneous population described moran process special case fully connected graph evenly weighted edges spatial structures described graphs vertices connected nearest neighbours also explore evolution random scale-free networks- determine fixation probability mutants characterize graphs fixation behaviour identical homogeneous population furthermore graphs act suppressors others amplifiers selection even possible find graphs guarantee fixation advantageous mutant also study frequency-dependent selection show outcome evolutionary games can depend entirely structure underlying graph evolutionary graph theory many fascinating applications ranging ecology multi-cellular organization economics
