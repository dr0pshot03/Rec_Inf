separate evolutionary origins teeth evidence fossil jawed vertebrates 
placoderms extinct jawed fishes class placodermi basal among jawed vertebrates generally thought teeth absent placoderms phylogenetic origin teeth occurred evolution jaws however now report presence tooth rows derived placoderms arthrodires new teeth composed gnathostome-type dentine develop specific locations hence appears placoderm teeth develop regulated jawed vertebrates tooth development occurs derived forms placoderms suggest teeth evolved least twice mechanism convergent evolution
