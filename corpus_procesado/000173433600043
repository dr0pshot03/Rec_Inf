laboratory analogue event horizon using slow light atomic medium 
singularities underlie many optical phenomena1 rainbow example involves particular type singularity-a ray catastrophe-in light rays become infinitely intense practice wave nature light resolves infinities producing interference patterns event horizon black hole2 time stands still waves oscillate infinitely small wavelengths however quantum nature light results evasion catastrophe emission hawking radiation3 report theoretical laboratory analogue event horizon: parabolic profile group velocity7 light brought standstill atomic medium4- can cause wave singularity similar associated black holes turn quantum vacuum forced create photon pairs characteristic spectrum phenomenon related hawking radiation3 idea may initiate theory quantum catastrophes extending classical catastrophe theory89
