laboratory analogue event horizon using slow light atomic medium 
singularities underlie many optical phenomena rainbow example involves particular type singularity-a ray catastrophe-in light rays become infinitely intense practice wave nature light resolves infinities producing interference patterns event horizon black hole time stands still waves oscillate infinitely small wavelengths however quantum nature light results evasion catastrophe emission hawking radiation report theoretical laboratory analogue event horizon: parabolic profile group velocity light brought standstill atomic medium- can cause wave singularity similar associated black holes turn quantum vacuum forced create photon pairs characteristic spectrum phenomenon related hawking radiation idea may initiate theory quantum catastrophes extending classical catastrophe theory
