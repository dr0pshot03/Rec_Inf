fast vesicle replenishment allows indefatigable signalling first auditory synapse
ribbon-type synapses inner hair cells mammalian cochlea encode complexity auditory signals fast tonic release fusion neurotransmitter-containing vesicles instant vesicles tethered synaptic ribbon docked plasma membrane constituting readily releasable pool although pool contains number vesicles conventional synapses ribbon release sites operate rates two orders magnitude higher submillisecond precision- sites replenish vesicles efficiently remains unclear show using two-photon imaging single release sites intact cochlea preformed vesicles derived cytoplasmic vesicle-generating compartments participate fast release replenishment vesicles released maximal initial rate per millisecond depolarizing pulse replenished rate per millisecond propose rapid resupply vesicles enables temporally precise sustained release rates may explain first auditory synapse can encode indefatigable precision without rely slow local endocytic vesicle cycle
