fibronectin requirement branching morphogenesis 
many organs including salivary glands lung kidney formed embryonic development epithelial branching branching morphogenesis repetitive epithelial cleft bud formation create complex three-dimensional branching structures characteristic many organs- although mechanisms poorly understood one might involve site-specific accumulation regulatory protein show extracellular matrix protein fibronectin essential cleft formation initiation epithelial branching fibronectin messenger rna fibrils appeared transiently focally forming cleft regions submandibular salivary-gland epithelia accompanied adjacent loss cadherin localization decreasing fibronectin concentration using small interfering rna inhibition anti-fibronectin anti-integrin antibodies blocked cleft formation branching exogenous fibronectin accelerated cleft formation branching similar effects fibronectin suppression augmentation observed developing lung kidney mechanistic studies revealed fibrillar fibronectin can induce cell-matrix adhesions cultured human salivary epithelial cells local loss cadherins cell-cell junctions thus fibronectin expression required cleft formation branching morphogenesis associated conversion cell-cell adhesions cell-matrix adhesions
