dynamic brain sources visual evoked responses
long debated whether averaged electrical responses recorded scalp result stimulus-evoked brain events stimulus-induced changes ongoing brain dynamics human visual selective attention task show nontarget event-related potentials mainly generated partial stimulus-induced phase resetting multiple electroencephalographic processes independent component analysis applied single-trial data identified least eight classes contributing components including producing central lateral posterior alpha left right mu frontal midline theta rhythms scalp topographies components consistent generation compact cortical domains
