common genetic variants modulate pathogen-sensing responses human dendritic cells
little known human genetic variation affects responses environmental stimuli context complex diseases experimental computational approaches applied determine effects genetic variation induction pathogen-responsive genes human dendritic cells identified common genetic variants associated cis variation expression responses escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide influenza interferon-beta ifn-beta localized validated causal variants binding sites pathogen-activated stat signal transducer activator transcription irf ifn-regulatory factor transcription factors also identified common variant irf7 associated trans type ifn induction response influenza infection results reveal common alleles explain interindividual variation pathogen sensing provide functional annotation genetic variants alter susceptibility inflammatory diseases
