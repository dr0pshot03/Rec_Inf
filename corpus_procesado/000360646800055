titin mutations ips cells define sarcomere insufficiency cause dilated cardiomyopathy
human mutations truncate massive sarcomere protein titin [ttn-truncating variants ttntvs] common genetic cause dilated cardiomyopathy dcm major cause heart failure premature death show cardiac microtissues engineered human induced pluripotent stem ips cells powerful system evaluating pathogenicity titin gene variants found certain missense mutations like ttntvs diminish contractile performance pathogenic combining functional analyses rna sequencing explain truncations a-band domain ttn cause dcm whereas truncations band better tolerated finally demonstrate mutant titin protein ips cell-derived cardiomyocytes results sarcomere insufficiency impaired responses mechanical beta-adrenergic stress attenuated growth factor cell signaling activation findings indicate titin mutations cause dcm disrupting critical linkages sarcomerogenesis adaptive remodeling
