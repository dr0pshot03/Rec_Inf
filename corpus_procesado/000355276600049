transcription factor gabp selectively binds activates mutant tert promoter cancer
reactivation telomerase reverse transcriptase tert expression enables cells overcome replicative senescence escape apoptosis fundamental steps initiation human cancer multiple cancer types including % glioblastomas gbms harbor highly recurrent tert promoter mutations unknown function specific two nucleotide positions identified functional consequence mutations gbms recruitment multimeric ga-binding protein gabp transcription factor specifically mutant promoter allelic recruitment gabp consistently observed across four cancer types highlighting shared mechanism underlying tert reactivation tandem flanking native e26 transformation-specific motifs critically cooperate mutations activate tert probably facilitating gabp heterotetramer binding gabp thus directly links tert promoter mutations aberrant expression multiple cancers
