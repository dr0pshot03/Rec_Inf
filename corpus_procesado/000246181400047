protein dynamics control kinetics initial electron transfer photosynthesis 
initial electron transfer dynamics photosynthesis studied rhodobacter sphaeroides reaction centers wild type mutants driving force kinetics charge separation vary broad range surprisingly protein relaxation kinetics measured tryptophan absorbance changes invariant mutants applying reaction-diffusion model can fit complex electron transfer kinetics mutant quantitatively varying driving force results indicate initial photosynthetic charge separation limited protein dynamics rather static electron transfer barrier
