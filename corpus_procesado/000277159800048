analysis genetic inheritance family quartet whole-genome sequencing 
analyzed whole-genome sequences family four consisting two siblings parents family-based sequencing allowed us delineate recombination sites precisely identify % sequencing errors resulting > % accuracy identify rare single-nucleotide polymorphisms also directly estimated human intergeneration mutation rate similar x - per position per haploid genome offspring family two recessive disorders: miller syndrome gene concurrently identified primary ciliary dyskinesia causative genes previously identified family-based genome analysis enabled us narrow candidate genes mendelian disorders four results demonstrate value complete genome sequencing families
