relaxation mechanism hydrated electron
relaxation dynamics photoexcited hydrated electron subject conflicting interpretations report time-resolved photoelectron spectra hydrated electrons liquid microjet aim clarifying ambiguities previous experiments sequence three ultrashort laser pulses similar femtosecond duration successively created hydrated electrons charge-transfer-to-solvent excitation dissolved anions electronically excited electrons via s > p transition ejected vacuum two distinct transient signals observed one assigned initially excited p-state lifetime similar femtoseconds lifetime similar femtoseconds attributed s-state electrons just internal conversion nonequilibrated solvent environment assignments support nonadiabatic relaxation model
