taylor vortex analogy granular flows
fluids sheared concentric rotating cylinders undergo series three-dimensional instabilities since taylors archetypal study proved pivotal understanding fluid flows become unstable eventually undergo transitions chaotic turbulent states- contrast predicting dynamics granular systems nano-sized particles debris flows far less reliable shear materials resemble fluids solid-like responses non-equilibrium structures segregation patterns develop unexpectedly- result analysis geophysical events performance largely empirical particle technologies might suffer using gas fluidization overcome jamming show experimentally granular materials develop vortices consistent primary taylor instability fluids however vortices observed fluidized granular bed unlike fluids accompanied novel mixing segregation transitions vortices seem alleviate increased strain spawning new vortices directly modifying scale kinetic interactions observations provide insights mechanisms shear transmission particles consequent convective mixing
