polarization rotation mechanism ultrahigh electromechanical response single-crystal piezoelectrics
piezoelectric materials convert mechanical electrical energyand vice versa crucial medical imaging telecommunication ultrasonic devices new generation single-crystal materials pbzn1/3nb2/ o--pbtio3 pzn-pt pbmg1/3nb2/o--pbtio3 pmn-pt exhibit piezoelectric effect ten times larger conventional ceramics may revolutionize applications however mechanism underlying ultrahigh performance new materials-and consequently possibilities improvements-are present clear report first-principles study ferroelectric perovskite batio3 similar single-crystal pzn-pt simpler system analyse show large piezoelectric response can driven polarization rotation induced external electric field computations suggest design materials better performance may stimulate interest fundamental theory dielectric systems finite electric fields
