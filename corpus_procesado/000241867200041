spider toxins activate capsaicin receptor produce inflammatory pain 
bites stings venomous creatures can produce pain inflammation part defensive strategy ward predators competitors molecules accounting lethal effects venoms extensively characterized less known mechanisms produce pain venoms spiders snakes cone snails scorpions contain pharmacopoeia peptide toxins block receptor channel activation means producing shock paralysis death- examined whether venoms also contain toxins activate rather inhibit excitatory channels somatosensory neurons produce noxious sensation mammals show venom tarantula native west indies contains three inhibitor cysteine knot ick peptides target capsaicin receptor trpv1 excitatory channel expressed sensory neurons pain pathway contrast predominant role ick toxins channel inhibitors previously unknown vanillotoxins function trpv1 agonists providing new tools understanding mechanisms trp channel gating vanillotoxins also inhibit voltage-gated potassium channels supporting potential similarities trp voltage-gated channel structures trp channels can now included among targets peptide toxins showing animals like plants example chilli peppers avert predators activating trp channels sensory nerve fibres elicit pain inflammation
