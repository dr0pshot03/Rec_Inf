dynamos asymptotic-giant-branch stars origin magnetic fields shaping planetary nebulae 
planetary nebulae thought formed slow wind progenitor giant star overtaken subsequent fast wind generated star enters white dwarf stage shock forms near boundary winds creating relatively dense shell characteristic planetary nebula spherically symmetric wind will produce spherically symmetric shell yet half known planetary nebulae spherical rather elliptical bipolar shape magnetic field launch collimate bipolar outflow origin field hitherto unclear previous work even suggested field generated show asymptotic-giant-branch agb star can indeed generate strong magnetic field origin dynamo interface rapidly rotating core slowly rotating envelope star fields strong enough shape bipolar outflows produce observed bipolar planetary nebulae magnetic braking stellar core process may also explain puzzlingly slow rotation white dwarf stars
