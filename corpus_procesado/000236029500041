mosfet-embedded microcantilevers measuring deflection biomolecular sensors
promising approach detecting biomolecules follows binding immobilized probe molecules microfabricated cantilevers binding causes surface stresses bend cantilever measured deflection order tens nanometers embedding metal-oxide semiconductor field-effect transistor mosfet base cantilever recording decreases drain current deflections small nanometers gate region mosfet responds surface stresses thus embedded silicon nitride avoid direct contact sample solution approach offers low noise high sensitivity direct readout used detect specific binding events biotin antibodies
