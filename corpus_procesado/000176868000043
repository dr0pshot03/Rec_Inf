dendritic spikes mechanism cooperative long-term potentiation 
strengthening synaptic connections following coincident pre postsynaptic activity proposed hebb cellular mechanism learning1 contemporary models assume multiple synapses must act cooperatively induce postsynaptic activity required hebbian synaptic plasticity2- one mechanism implementation cooperation action potential firing begins axon can influence synaptic potentiation following active backpropagation dendrites6 backpropagation limited however action potentials often fail invade distal dendrites7- show long-term potentiation synapses distal dendrites hippocampal ca1 pyramidal neurons require cooperative synaptic inputs require axonal action potential firing backpropagation rather locally generated spatially restricted regenerative potentials dendritic spikes contribute postsynaptic depolarization calcium entry necessary trigger potentiation distal synapses find mechanism can also function proximal synapses suggesting dendritic spikes participate generally form synaptic potentiation require postsynaptic action potential firing axon
