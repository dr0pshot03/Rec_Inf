hangover gene defines stress pathway required ethanol tolerance development
repeated alcohol consumption leads development tolerance simply defined acquired resistance physiological behavioural effects drug tolerance allows increased alcohol consumption time leads physical dependence possibly addiction- previous studies shown drosophila develop ethanol tolerance kinetics acquisition dissipation mimic seen mammals tolerance requires catecholamine octopamine functional analogue mammalian noradrenaline describe new gene hangover required normal development ethanol tolerance hangover flies also defective responses environmental stressors heat free-radical-generating agent paraquat using genetic epistasis tests show ethanol tolerance drosophila relies two distinct molecular pathways: cellular stress pathway defined hangover parallel pathway requiring octopamine hangover encodes large nuclear zinc-finger protein suggesting role nucleic acid binding growing recognition stress cellular systemic levels contributes drug addiction-related behaviours mammals studies suggest role may conserved across evolution
