observation antimatter helium nucleus
high-energy nuclear collisions create energy density similar universe microseconds big bang cases matter antimatter formed comparable abundance however relatively short-lived expansion nuclear collisions allows antimatter decouple quickly matter avoid annihilation thus high-energy accelerator heavy nuclei provides efficient means producing studying antimatter antimatter helium nucleus bar also known anti-alpha alpha bar consists two antiprotons two antineutrons baryon number b observed previously although alpha-particle identified century ago rutherford present cosmic radiation ten per cent level antimatter nuclei b observed rare products interactions particle accelerators rate antinucleus production high-energy collisions decreases factor additional antinucleon- report observation <he bar heaviest observed antinucleus date total bar counts detected star experiment relativistic heavy ion collider rhic ref recorded gold-on-gold au+au collisions centre-of-mass energies gev gev per nucleon-nucleon pair yield consistent expectations thermodynamic coalescent nucleosynthesis models providing indication production rate even heavier antimatter nuclei benchmark possible future observations bar cosmic radiation
