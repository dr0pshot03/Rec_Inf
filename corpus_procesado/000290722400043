observation antimatter helium- nucleus 
high-energy nuclear collisions create energy density similar universe microseconds big bang1; cases matter antimatter formed comparable abundance however relatively short-lived expansion nuclear collisions allows antimatter decouple quickly matter avoid annihilation thus high-energy accelerator heavy nuclei provides efficient means producing studying antimatter antimatter helium- nucleus 4he bar also known anti-alpha alpha bar consists two antiprotons two antineutrons baryon number b observed previously although alpha-particle identified century ago rutherford present cosmic radiation ten per cent level2 antimatter nuclei b observed rare products interactions particle accelerators rate antinucleus production high-energy collisions decreases factor additional antinucleon3- report observation <he bar heaviest observed antinucleus date total 4he bar counts detected star experiment relativistic heavy ion collider rhic; ref recorded gold-on-gold au+au collisions centre-of-mass energies gev gev per nucleon-nucleon pair yield consistent expectations thermodynamic7 coalescent nucleosynthesis8 models providing indication production rate even heavier antimatter nuclei benchmark possible future observations 4he bar cosmic radiation
