confirmation general relativity large scales weak lensing galaxy velocities 
although general relativity underlies modern cosmology applicability cosmological length scales yet stringently tested test recently proposed using quantity eg combines measures large-scale gravitational lensing galaxy clustering structure growth rate combination insensitive galaxy bias difference clustering visible galaxies invisible dark matter thus robust uncertainty parameter modified theories gravity generally predict values eg different general relativistic prediction theories gravitational slip difference two potentials describe perturbations gravitational metric non-zero leads changes growth structure strength gravitational lensing effect report eg +/ length scales tens megaparsecs agreement general relativistic prediction eg approximate measured value excludes model within tensor-vector-scalar gravity theory modifies newtonian einstein gravity however relatively large uncertainty still permits models within fr theory extension general relativity fivefold decrease uncertainty needed rule models
