molecular sociology cell
proteomic studies yielded detailed lists proteins present cell comparatively little known however proteins interact spatially arranged within functional modules cell: molecular sociology cell gap now bridged using emerging experimental techniques mass spectrometry complexes single particle cryo electron microscopy complement traditional biochemical biophysical methods development integrative computational methods exploit data obtained hybrid approaches will uncover molecular architectures perhaps even atomic models many protein complexes structures hand researchers will poised use cryo electron tomography view protein complexes action within cells providing unprecedented insights protein interaction networks
