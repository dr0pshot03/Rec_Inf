solid-state quantum memory using p nuclear spin
transfer information different physical forms example processing entities memory central theme communication computation crucial quantum computation great effort must taken protect integrity fragile quantum bit qubit however transfer quantum information particularly challenging process must remain coherent times preserve quantum nature information demonstrate coherent transfer superposition state electron spin processing qubit nuclear spin memory qubit using combination microwave radio frequency pulses applied p donors isotopically pure si crystal state left nuclear spin time-scale long compared electron decoherence time coherently transferred back electron spin thus demonstrating p nuclear spin solid-state quantum memory overall store readout fidelity per cent loss attributed imperfect rotations can improved use composite pulses coherence lifetime quantum memory element k exceeds s
