stability limit atmospheres giant extrasolar planets 
recent observations planet hd209458b indicate surrounded expanded atmosphere atomic hydrogen escaping hydrodynamically- theoretically shown escape possible least inside orbit au refs also h+ ions play crucial role cooling upper atmosphere jupiters atmosphere stable somewhere au must crossover stability instability show sharp breakdown atmospheric stability au jupiter like planet orbiting solar type star results contrast earlier modelling implied much higher thermospheric temperatures significant evaporation farther star use three dimensional time dependent coupled thermosphere ionosphere model properly include cooling h+ ions allowing us model globally redistribution heat changes molecular composition au cooling h+ ions balances heating star inside au molecular hydrogen dissociates thermally suppressing formation h+ effectively shutting mode cooling
