selective stimulation t cell subsets antibody-cytokine immune complexes
interleukin il- growth factor t lymphocytes can also sometimes inhibitory thus proliferation cd8+ t cells vivo increased injection monoclonal antibody specific il il mab perhaps reflecting removal il--dependent cd4+ t regulatory cells t regs instead show il mab augments proliferation cd8+ cells mice simply increasing biological activity preexisting il formation immune complexes coupled recombinant il- il-/il mab complexes cause massive >-fold expansion cd8+ cells vivo whereas others selectively stimulate cd4+ t regs thus different cytokine-antibody complexes can used selectively boost inhibit immune response
