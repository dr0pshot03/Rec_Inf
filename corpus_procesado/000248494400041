block copolymer assembly via kinetic control 
block copolymers consist two chemically different polymer segments blocks connected covalent linkage solution amphiphilic blocks can self-assemble result energetic repulsion effects blocks degree repulsion lengths block segments selectivity solvent primarily control resultant assembled morphology ideal situation one like able alter morphology forms without change chemistry block copolymer kinetic manipulation charged amphiphilic block copolymers solution able generate different nanoscale structures simple block copolymer chemistry technique relies divalent organic counter ions solvent mixtures drive organization block copolymers specific pathways complex one-dimensional structures block copolymers increasingly used templating materials thus ability control formation specific patterns structures growing interest applicability
