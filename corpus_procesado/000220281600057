genetic basis natural variation d-melanogaster antibacterial immunity
many genes involved drosophila melanogaster innate immune processes identified whether naturally occurring polymorphism genes leads variation immune competence among wild flies tested report substantial variability among wild-derived d melanogaster ability suppress infection gram-negative entomopathogen serratia marcescens variability immune competence significantly associated nucleotide polymorphism innate immunity genes corresponding primarily pathogen recognition intracellular signaling loci substantial epistasis detected intracellular signaling antimicrobial peptide genes variation genes therefore seems drive variability immunocompetence among wild drosophila
