subset dopamine neurons signals reward odour memory drosophila
animals approach stimuli predict pleasant outcome paired presentation odour reward drosophila melanogaster can develop conditioned approach towards odour despite recent advances understanding neural circuits associative memory appetitive motivation cellular mechanisms reward processing fly brain unknown show group dopamine neurons protocerebral anterior medial pam cluster signals sugar reward transient activation inactivation target neurons intact behaving flies dopamine neurons selectively required reinforcing property reflexive response sugar stimulus vivo calcium imaging revealed neurons activated sugar ingestion activation increased starvation output sites pam neurons mainly localized medial lobes mushroom bodies mbs appetitive olfactory associative memory formed therefore propose pam cluster neurons endow positive predictive value odour mbs dopamine insects known mediate aversive reinforcement signals- results highlight cellular specificity underlying various roles dopamine importance spatially segregated local circuits within mbs
