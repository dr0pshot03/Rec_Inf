structural basis activation plant immunity bacterial effector protein avrpto 
pathogenic microbes use effectors enhance susceptibility host plants however plants evolved sophisticated immune system detect effectors using cognate disease resistance proteins1 recognition highly specific often elicits rapid localized cell death known hypersensitive response thus potentially limits pathogen growth2- despite numerous genetic biochemical studies interactions pathogen effector proteins plant resistance proteins structural bases interactions remain elusive direct interaction tomato protein kinase pto pseudomonas syringae effector protein avrpto known trigger disease resistance programmed cell death67 nucleotide-binding site/leucine-rich repeat nbs-lrr class disease resistance protein prf8 present crystal structure avrpto-pto complex contrary widely held hypothesis avrpto activates pto kinase activity structural biochemical analyses demonstrated avrpto inhibitor pto kinase vitro avrpto-pto interaction mediated phosphorylation-stabilized p+ loop second loop pto negatively regulate prf-mediated defences absence avrpto tomato plants together results show avrpto derepresses host defences interacting two defence-inhibition loops pto
