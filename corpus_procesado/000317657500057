structural basis kinesin-: cargo recognition 
kinesin-mediated cargo transport required many cellular functions plays key role pathological processes structural information kinesins recognize cargoes required molecular understanding fundamental ubiquitous process present crystal structure tetratricopeptide repeat domain kinesin light chain complex cargo peptide harboring "tryptophan-acidic" motif derived skip sifa-kinesin interacting protein critical host determinant salmonella pathogenesis regulator lysosomal positioning structural data together biophysical biochemical cellular assays allow us propose framework intracellular transport based binding kinesin- w-acidic cargo motifs combination electrostatic interactions sequence-specific elements providing direct molecular evidence mechanisms kinesin-: cargo recognition
