organic matter stoichiometry flux oxygen control nitrogen loss ocean
biologically available nitrogen limits photosynthesis much world ocean organic matter om stoichiometry thought control balance two major nitrogen removal pathways-denitrification anammox-but expected proportion % anammox derived mean oceanic om rarely observed environment incubations designed directly test effects stoichiometry however showed ratio anammox denitrification depends stoichiometry om supply predicted furthermore observed rates nitrogen loss increase magnitude om supply variable ratios denitrification anammox previously observed ocean thus attributable localized variations om quality quantity necessitate revision global nitrogen cycle
