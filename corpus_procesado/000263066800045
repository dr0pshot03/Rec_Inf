sequential sympatric speciation across trophic levels 
major cause biodiversity may biodiversity new species form may create new niches others exploit potentially catalyzing chain reaction speciation events across trophic levels tested sequential radiation rhagoletis pomonella diptera: tephritidae complex model sympatric speciation via host plant shifting report parasitic wasp diachasma alloeum hymenoptera: braconidae formed new incipient species result specializing diversifying fly hosts including recently derived apple infesting race r pomonella furthermore show traits differentially adapt r pomonella flies host plants also quickly evolved serve ecological barriers reproduction isolating wasps speciation therefore cascades effects new niche construction move across trophic levels
