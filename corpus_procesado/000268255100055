synchronous stochastic patterns gene activation drosophila embryo
drosophila embryogenesis characterized rapid transitions gene activity whereby crudely distributed gradients regulatory proteins give way precise on/off patterns gene expression explore underlying mechanisms partially automated quantitative situ hybridization method used visualize expression profiles developmental control genes hundreds embryos studies revealed two distinct patterns gene activation: synchronous stochastic synchronous genes display essentially uniform expression nascent transcripts cells embryonic tissue whereas stochastic genes display erratic patterns de novo activation rna polymerase ii pre-loaded stalled promoter regions synchronous genes stochastic genes transcriptional synchrony might ensure orderly deployment complex gene regulatory networks control embryogenesis
