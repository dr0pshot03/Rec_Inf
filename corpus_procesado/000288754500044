perspective cancer cell metastasis
metastasis causes cancer deaths yet process remains one enigmatic aspects disease building new mechanistic insights emerging recent research offer perspective metastatic process reflect possible paths future exploration suggest metastasis can portrayed two-phase process: first phase involves physical translocation cancer cell distant organ whereas second encompasses ability cancer cell develop metastatic lesion distant site although much remains learned second phase feel understanding first phase now within sight due part better understanding cancer cell behavior can modified cell-biological program called epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition
