observing average trajectories single photons two-slit interferometer 
consequence quantum mechanical uncertainty principle one may discuss path "trajectory" quantum particle takes measurement position irrevocably disturbs momentum vice versa using weak measurements however possible operationally define set trajectories ensemble quantum particles sent single photons emitted quantum dot double-slit interferometer reconstructed trajectories performing weak measurement photon momentum postselected according result strong measurement photon position series planes results provide observationally grounded description propagation subensembles quantum particles two-slit interferometer
