tet1 hydroxymethylcytosine transcription dna methylation fidelity
enzymes catalysing methylation position cytosine mc essential roles regulating gene expression maintaining cellular identity recently tet1 found hydroxylate methyl group mc converting hydroxymethyl cytosine hmc show tet1 binds throughout genome embryonic stem cells majority binding sites located transcription start sites tsss cpg-rich promoters within genes hmc modification found gene bodies contrast mc also enriched cpg-rich tsss provide evidence tet1 role transcriptional repression tet1 binds significant proportion polycomb group target genes furthermore tet1 associates colocalizes sin3a co-repressor complex propose tet1 fine-tunes transcription opposes aberrant dna methylation cpg-rich sequences thereby contributes regulation dna methylation fidelity
