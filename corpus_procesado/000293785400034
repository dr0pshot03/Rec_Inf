circumstellar material type ia supernovae via sodium absorption features
type ia supernovae key tools measuring distances cosmic scale generally thought thermonuclear explosion accreting white dwarf close binary system nature mass donor still uncertain single-degenerate model main-sequence star evolved star whereas double-degenerate model another white dwarf show velocity structure absorbing material along line sight type ia supernovae tends blueshifted structures likely signatures gas outflows supernova progenitor systems thus many type ia supernovae nearby spiral galaxies may originate single-degenerate systems
