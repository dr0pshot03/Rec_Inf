distinct fermi-momentum-dependent energy gaps deeply underdoped bi2212 
used angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy applied deeply underdoped cuprate superconductors bi2sr2ca-x yxcu2o8 bi2212 reveal presence two distinct energy gaps exhibiting different doping dependence one gap associated antinodal region coherent peak observed increased underdoping behavior known decade considered general gap behavior underdoped regime gap associated near-nodal regime coherent peak spectrum can observed increase less doping behavior previously observed single particle spectra propose two-gap scenario momentum space consistent experiments may contain important information mechanism high-transition temperature superconductivity
