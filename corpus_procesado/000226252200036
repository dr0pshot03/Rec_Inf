simplicity metazoan cell lineages 
developmental processes thought highly complex attempts measure compare complexity across different groups organisms- introduce measure biological complexity based similarity developmental computer programs- define algorithmic complexity cell lineage length shortest description lineage based constituent sublineages- use measure estimate complexity embryonic lineages four metazoan species two different phyla find cell lineages significantly simpler expected chance furthermore evolutionary simulations show complexity embryonic lineages surveyed near simplest lineages evolvable assuming strong developmental constraints spatial positions cells stabilizing selection cell number propose selection decreased complexity played major role moulding metazoan cell lineages
