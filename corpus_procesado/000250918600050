trapped rainbow storage light metamaterials
light usually propagates inside transparent materials well known ways however recent research- examined possibility modifying way light travels taking normal transparent dielectric inserting tiny metallic inclusions various shapes arrangements light passes structures oscillating electric currents set generate electromagnetic field moments can lead dramatic effects light propagation negative refraction possible applications include lenses break traditional diffraction limits `invisibility cloaks refs significantly less research focused potential structures slowing trapping releasing light signals demonstrate theoretically axially varying heterostructure metamaterial core negative refractive index can used efficiently coherently bring light complete standstill contrast previous approaches decelerating storing light- present scheme simultaneously allows high in-coupling efficiencies broadband room-temperature operation surprisingly analysis reveals critical point effective thickness waveguide reduced zero preventing light wave propagating point light ray permanently trapped trajectory forming double light-cone call `optical clepsydra frequency component wave packet stopped different guide thickness leading spatial separation spectrum formation `trapped rainbow results bridge gap two important contemporary realms science-metamaterials slow light combined investigations may lead applications optical data processing storage realization quantum optical memories
