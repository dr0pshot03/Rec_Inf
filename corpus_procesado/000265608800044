burst spiking single cortical neuron modifies global brain state 
different global patterns brain activity associated distinct arousal behavioral states animal brain rapidly switches different states remains unclear report repetitive high-frequency burst spiking single rat cortical neuron trigger switch cortical states resembling slow-wave rapid-eye-movement sleep reflected switching membrane potential stimulated neuron slow up/down oscillations persistent-up state vice versa concurrent changes temporal pattern cortical local field potential lfp recorded several millimeters away results point power single cortical neurons modulating behavioral state animal
