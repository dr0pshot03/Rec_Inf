reciprocal binding parp histone h1 promoters specifies transcriptional outcomes
nucleosome binding proteins act modulate promoter chromatin architecture transcription target genes used genomic gene specific approaches show two factors histone h1 poly adp ribose polymerase parp exhibit reciprocal pattern chromatin binding many rna polymerase ii transcribed promoters parp enriched h1 depleted promoters pattern binding associated actively transcribed genes furthermore showed parp acts exclude h1 subset parp stimulated promoters suggesting functional interplay parp h1 level nucleosome binding thus although h1 parp similar nucleosome binding properties effects chromatin structure vitro distinct roles determining gene expression outcomes vivo
