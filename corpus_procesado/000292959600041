experimental theoretical differential cross sections four-atom reaction: hd+oh > h2o+d
quantum dynamical theories progressed stage state-to-state differential cross sections can now routinely computed high accuracy three-atom systems since first calculation carried years ago h + h system reactions beyond three atoms however highly accurate quantum dynamical calculations differential cross sections feasible recently developed quantum wave packet method compute full-dimensional differential cross sections four-atom reactions report benchmark calculations carried prototypical hd + oh > h2o + d reaction accurate potential energy surface yield differential cross sections excellent agreement high-resolution crossed-molecular beam experiment
