water oxidized dioxygen: structure photosynthetic mn4ca cluster
oxidation water dioxygen catalyzed within photosystem ii psii mn4ca cluster structure remains elusive polarized extended x-ray absorption fine structure exafs measurements psii single crystals constrain mn4ca cluster geometry set three similar high-resolution structures combining polarized exafs x-ray diffraction data cluster placed within psii taking account overall trend electron density metal site putative ligands structure cluster present study unlike either angstrom resolution x-ray structures previously proposed models
