atomic layer deposition oxide thin films metal alkoxides oxygen sources
chemical approach atomic layer deposition ald oxide thin films reported instead using water compounds oxygen source oxygen obtained metal alkoxide serves oxygen metal source reacts another metal compound metal chloride metal alkyl reactions generally enable deposition oxides many metals approach alumina film deposited silicon without creating interfacial silicon oxide layer otherwise forms easily finding adds benefits ald method especially atomic-level thickness control excellent uniformity takes major step toward scientifically challenging technologically important task replacing silica gate dielectric future generations metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistors
