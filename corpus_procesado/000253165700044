premetazoan ancestry cadherins 
cadherin mediated cell adhesion signaling essential metazoan development yet absent multicellular organisms found cadherin genes numbers similar observed complex metazoans one closest single celled relatives metazoans choanoflagellate monosiga brevicollis evolution metazoans single celled ancestor required novel cell adhesion signaling mechanisms discovery diverse cadherins choanoflagellates suggests cadherins may contributed metazoan origins
