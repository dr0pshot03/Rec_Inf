localization iron arabidopsis seed requires vacuolar membrane transporter vit1
iron deficiency major human nutritional problem wherever plant-based diets common using synchrotron x-ray fluorescence microtomography directly visualize iron arabidopsis seeds show iron localized primarily provascular strands embryo localization completely abolished vacuolar iron uptake transporter vit1 disrupted vacuolar iron storage also critical seedling development vit1 seedlings grow poorly iron limiting uncovered fundamental aspect seed biology will ultimately aid development nutrient-rich seed benefiting human health agricultural productivity
