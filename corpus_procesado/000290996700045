diffusible signals autonomous mechanisms determine main proximodistal limb subdivision 
vertebrate limbs develop three main proximodistal pd segments upper arm forearm hand proximal-to-distal sequence despite extensive research limb development whether pd specification occurs nonautonomous autonomous mechanisms resolved heterotopic transplantation intact recombinant chicken limb buds identifies signals embryo trunk proximalize distal limb cells generate complete pd axis transplants retinoic acid induces proximalization counteracted fibroblast growth factors distal limb bud; related actions suggest first limb-bud pd regionalization results balance proximal distal signals plasticity limb progenitor cell identity response diffusible signals provides unifying view pd patterning vertebrate limb development regeneration
