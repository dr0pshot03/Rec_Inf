sdh5 gene required flavination succinate dehydrogenase mutated paraganglioma
mammalian mitochondria contain proteins nearly uncharacterized given well-established role mitochondrial defects human disease functional characterization proteins may shed new light disease mechanisms starting yeast model system investigated uncharacterized highly conserved mitochondrial protein named sdh5 yeast human sdh5 interact catalytic subunit succinate dehydrogenase sdh complex component electron transport chain tricarboxylic acid cycle sdh5 required sdh-dependent respiration sdh1 flavination incorporation flavin adenine dinucleotide cofactor germline loss-of-function mutations human sdh5 gene located chromosome 11q13 segregate disease family hereditary paraganglioma neuroendocrine tumor previously linked mutations genes encoding sdh subunits thus mitochondrial proteomics analysis yeast led discovery human tumor susceptibility gene
