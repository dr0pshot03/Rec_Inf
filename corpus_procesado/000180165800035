thermonuclear supernovae: simulations deflagration stage implications 
large-scale three-dimensional numerical simulations deflagration stage thermonuclear supernova explosion show formation evolution highly convoluted turbulent flame gravitational field expanding carbon-oxygen white dwarf flame dynamics dominated gravity-induced rayleigh-taylor instability controls burning rate thermonuclear deflagration releases enough energy produce healthy explosion turbulent flame however leaves large amounts unburned partially burned material near star center whereas observations imply materials present outer layers disagreement resolved deflagration triggers detonation
