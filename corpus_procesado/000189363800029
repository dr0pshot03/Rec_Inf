mice cloned olfactory sensory neurons
cloning nuclear transplantation successfully carried various mammals including mice now mice cloned post-mitotic cells neurons generated fertile mouse clones derived transferring nuclei post-mitotic olfactory sensory neurons oocytes results indicate genome post-mitotic terminally differentiated neuron can re-enter cell cycle reprogrammed state totipotency nuclear transfer moreover pattern odorant receptor gene expression organization odorant receptor genes cloned mice indistinguishable wild-type animals indicating irreversible changes dna olfactory neurons accompany receptor gene choice
