microscopic origin -anomaly quantum point contacts
quantum point contacts narrow one-dimensional constrictions usually patterned two-dimensional electron system example applying voltages local gates linear conductance point contact measured function channel width quantized- units gq 2e/h e electron charge h plancks constant however conductance also unexpected shoulder similar gq known -anomaly- whose origin still subject debate- proposed theoretical explanations invoked spontaneous spin polarization ferromagnetic spin coupling formation quasi-bound state leading kondo effect wigner crystallization various treatments inelastic scattering however explicit calculations fully reproduce various experimental observations regime -anomaly including zero-bias peak typically accompanies it- still lacking offer detailed microscopic explanation -anomaly zero-bias peak: common origin smeared van hove singularity local density states bottom lowest one-dimensional subband point contact causes anomalous enhancement hartree potential barrier magnetic spin susceptibility inelastic scattering rate find good qualitative agreement theoretical calculations experimental results dependence conductance gate voltage magnetic field temperature source-drain voltage including zero-bias peak interaction strength also clarify low-energy scale governing -anomaly depends gate voltage interactions low energies predict observe fermi-liquid behaviour similar associated kondo effect quantum dots high energies however similarities -anomaly kondo effect end
