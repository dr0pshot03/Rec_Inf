notch signals control fate immature progenitor cells intestine 
notch signalling pathway plays crucial role specifying cellular fates metazoan development regulating communication adjacent cells correlative studies suggested involvement notch intestinal development modulating notch activity mouse intestine directly implicate notch signals intestinal cell lineage specification also show notch activation capable amplifying intestinal progenitor pool inhibiting cell differentiation conclude notch activity required maintenance proliferating crypt cells intestinal epithelium
