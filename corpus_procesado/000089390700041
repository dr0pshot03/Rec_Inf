ordering self-organization nanocrystalline silicon
spontaneous formation organized nanocrystals semiconductors observed- heteroepitaxial growth chemical synthesis ability fabricate size-controlled silicon nanocrystals encapsulated insulating sio2 significant interest microelectronics industry reproducible manufacture crystals hampered amorphous nature sio2 differing thermal expansion coefficients two materials previous attempts- fabricate si nanocrystals failed achieve control shape crystallographic orientation latter property important systems si quantum dots report self-organization si nanocrystals larger angstrom brick-shaped crystallites oriented along [] crystallographic direction nanocrystals formed solid-phase crystallization nanometre-thick layers amorphous si confined sio2 layers shape orientation crystallites results relatively narrow photoluminescence whereas isotropic particles produce qualitatively different broad light emission results aid development maskless reproducible si nanofabrication techniques
