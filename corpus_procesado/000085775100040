fabrication photonic crystals visible spectrum holographic lithography 
term photonics describes technology whereby data transmission processing occurs largely entirely means photons photonic crystals microstructured materials dielectric constant periodically modulated length scale comparable desired wavelength operation multiple interference waves scattered fr om unit cell structure may open photonic bandgap-a range frequencies analogous electronic bandgap semiconductor within propagating electromagnetic modes exist- numerous device principles exploit property identified- considerable progress now made constructing two-dimensional structures using conventional lithography fabrication three-dimensional photonic crystal structures visible spectrum remains considerable challenge describe technique-three-dimensional holographic lithography-that well suited production three-dimensional structures sub-micrometre periodicity technique made microperiodic polymeric structures used templates create complementary structures higher refractive-index contrast
