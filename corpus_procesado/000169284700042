linearly polarized emission colloidal semiconductor quantum rods 
colloidal quantum rods cadmium selenide cdse exhibit linearly polarized emission empirical pseudopotential calculations predict slightly elongated cdse nanocrystals polarized emission along long axis unlike spherical dots emit plane-polarized light single-molecule luminescence spectroscopy measurements cdse quantum rods aspect ratio confirm sharp transition nonpolarized purely linearly polarized emission aspect ratio linearly polarized luminescent chromophores highly desirable variety applications
