large-scale nanophotonic phased array 
electromagnetic phased arrays radio frequencies well known enabled applications ranging communications radar broadcasting astronomy1 ability generate arbitrary radiation patterns large-scale phased arrays long pursued although extremely expensive cumbersome deploy large-scale radiofrequency phased arrays2 optical phased arrays unique advantage much shorter optical wavelength holds promise large-scale integration3 however short optical wavelength also imposes stringent requirements fabrication consequence although optical phased arrays studied various platforms4- recently chip-scale nanophotonics9- demonstrations far restricted one-dimensional small-scale two-dimensional arrays report demonstration large-scale two-dimensional nanophotonic phased array npa x optical nanoantennas densely integrated silicon chip within footprint mu m x mu m nanoantennas precisely balanced power aligned phase generate designed sophisticated radiation pattern far field also show active phase tunability can realized proposed npa demonstrating dynamic beam steering shaping x array work demonstrates robust design together state-of-the-art complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor technology allows large-scale npas implemented compact inexpensive nanophotonic chips turn enables arbitrary radiation pattern generation using npas therefore extends functionalities phased arrays beyond conventional beam focusing steering opening possibilities large-scale deployment applications communication laser detection ranging three-dimensional holography biomedical sciences name just
