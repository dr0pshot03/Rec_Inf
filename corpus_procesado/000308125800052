tlr13 recognizes bacterial 23s rrna devoid erythromycin resistance-forming modification 
host protection infection relies recognition pathogens innate pattern-recognition receptors toll-like receptors tlrs show orphan receptor tlr13 mice recognizes conserved 23s ribosomal rna rrna sequence binding site macrolide lincosamide streptogramin group mls antibiotics including erythromycin bacteria notably 23s rrna clinical isolates erythromycin-resistant staphylococcus aureus synthetic oligoribonucleotides carrying methylated adenosine guanosine mimicking mls resistance-causing modification failed stimulate tlr13 thus results reveal natural tlr13 ligand specific mechanisms antibiotic resistance potent bacterial immune evasion strategy avoiding recognition via tlr13
