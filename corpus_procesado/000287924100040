synchronicity antarctic temperatures local solar insolation orbital timescales 
milankovitch theory states global climate variability orbital timescales tens hundreds thousands years dominated summer insolation high northern latitudes supporting evidence includes reconstructed air temperatures antarctica nearly phase boreal summer insolation phase local summer insolation- antarctic climate therefore thought driven northern summer insolation clear mechanism links two hemispheres orbital timescales however missing propose key antarctic temperature records derived ice cores biased towards austral winter seasonal cycle snow accumulation using present-day estimates bias recorder system show local insolation can explain orbital component temperature record without invoke link northern hemisphere therefore antarctic ice-core-derived temperature record one best-dated records late pleistocene temperature evolution used support contradict milankovitch hypothesis global climate changes driven northern hemisphere summer insolation variations
