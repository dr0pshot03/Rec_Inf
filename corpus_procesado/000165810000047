contribution noise contrast invariance orientation tuning cat visual cortex
feedforward models visual cortex appear inconsistent well-known property cortical cells: contrast invariance orientation tuning models fixed threshold broadens orientation tuning contrast increases whereas real cells tuning width invariant contrast compared orientation tuning spike membrane potential responses single cells contrast invariant yet threshold-linear relation applied membrane potential accurately predicts orientation tuning spike responses key apparent paradox lies noisiness membrane potential responses subthreshold average still capable generating spikes individual trials unlike iceberg effect contrast invariance remains intact even threshold narrows orientation selectivity noise may extension smooth average relation membrane potential spike rate throughout brain
