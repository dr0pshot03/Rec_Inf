drosophila spire actin nucleation factor
actin cytoskeleton essential many cellular functions including shape determination intracellular transport locomotion previous work identified two factors arp2/ complex formin family proteins nucleate new actin filaments via different mechanisms show drosophila protein spire represents third class actin nucleation factor vitro spire nucleates new filaments rate similar formin family proteins slower activated arp2/ complex remains associated slow-growing pointed end new filament spire contains cluster four wasp homology wh2 domains binds actin monomer maximal nucleation activity requires four wh2 domains along additional actin-binding motif conserved among spire proteins spire conserved among metazoans together formin cappuccino required axis specification oocytes embryos suggesting multiple actin nucleation factors collaborate construct essential cytoskeletal structures
