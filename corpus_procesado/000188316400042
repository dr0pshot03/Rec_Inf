extensive gene traffic mammalian x chromosome 
mammalian sex chromosomes undergone profound changes since evolving ancestral autosomes examining retroposed genes human mouse genomes demonstrate evolution mammalian x chromosome generated recruited disproportionately high number functional retroposed genes whereas autosomes experienced lower gene turnover autosomal copies originating x-linked genes exhibited testis-biased expression export incompatible mutational bias likely driven natural selection attain male germline function however excess recruitment consistent combination natural selection mutational bias
