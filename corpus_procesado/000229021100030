retinoic acid signalling links left-right asymmetric patterning bilaterally symmetric somitogenesis zebrafish embryo 
embryogenesis cells spatially patterned result highly coordinated stereotyped morphogenetic events vertebrate embryo information laterality conveyed node subsequently lateral plate mesoderm complex cascade epigenetic genetic events eventually leading left right asymmetric body plan time paraxial mesoderm patterned along anterior posterior axis metameric units somites bilaterally symmetric fashion characterize cascade laterality information zebrafish embryo show blocking early steps cascade reaches lateral plate mesoderm results random left right asymmetric somitogenesis also uncover mechanism mediated retinoic acid signalling crucial buffering influence flow laterality information left right progression somite formation thus ensuring bilaterally symmetric somitogenesis
