secreted serine-threonine kinase determines virulence eukaryotic pathogen toxoplasma gondii 
toxoplasma gondii strains differ dramatically virulence despite genetically similar genetic mapping revealed two closely adjacent quantitative trait loci parasite chromosome viia control extreme virulence type lineage positional cloning identified candidate virulence gene rop18 highly polymorphic serine-threonine kinase secreted host cell parasite invasion transfection virulent rop18 allele nonpathogenic type iii strain increased growth enhanced mortality logs attributes rop18 required kinase activity revealed secretion effectors major component parasite virulence
