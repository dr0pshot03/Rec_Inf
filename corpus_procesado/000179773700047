heart regeneration zebrafish
cardiac injury mammals amphibians typically leads scarring minimal regeneration heart muscle demonstrate histologically zebrafish fully regenerate hearts within months % ventricular resection regeneration occurs robust proliferation cardiomyocytes localized leading epicardial edge new myocardium hearts zebrafish mutations mps1 mitotic checkpoint kinase critical cell cycle regulator failed regenerate formed scars thus injury-induced cardiomyocyte proliferation zebrafish can overcome scar formation allowing cardiac muscle regeneration findings indicate zebrafish will useful genetically dissecting molecular mechanisms cardiac regeneration
