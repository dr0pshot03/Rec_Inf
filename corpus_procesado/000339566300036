equalizing excitation-inhibition ratios across visual cortical neurons
relationship synaptic excitation inhibition e/i ratio two opposing forces mammalian cerebral cortex affects many cortical functions feature selectivity gain individual pyramidal cells show stable e/i ratios time despite fluctuating cortical activity levels excitation increases inhibition increases proportionally increased recruitment inhibitory neurons phenomenon referred excitation-inhibition balance- however little known distribution e/i ratios across pyramidal cells highly divergent axons inhibitory neurons indiscriminately contact neighbouring pyramidal cells inhibition homogeneously distributed individually matched different amounts excitation received distinct pyramidal cells discover pyramidal cells layer / mouse primary visual cortex receive inhibition similar proportion excitation consequence e/i ratios equalized across pyramidal cells matched inhibition mediated parvalbumin-expressing somatostatin-expressing inhibitory cells results independent adjustment synapses originating individual parvalbumin-expressing cells targeting different pyramidal cells furthermore match activity-dependent disrupted perturbing pyramidal cell activity thus equalization e/i ratios across pyramidal cells reveals unexpected degree order spatial distribution synaptic strengths indicates relationship cortexs two opposing forces stabilized time also space
