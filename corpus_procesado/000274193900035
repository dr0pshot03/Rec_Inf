evidence grid cells human memory network
grid cells entorhinal cortex freely moving rats provide strikingly periodic representation self-location indicative specific computational mechanisms- however existence grid cells humans distribution throughout brain unknown show preferred firing directions directionally modulated grid cells rat entorhinal cortex aligned grids spatial organization grid-cell firing strongly apparent faster slower running speeds grids also aligned predicted macroscopic signal visible functional magnetic resonance imaging fmri humans looked signal participants explored virtual reality environment mimicking rats foraging task: fmri activation adaptation showing speed-modulated six-fold rotational symmetry running direction signal found network entorhinal/subicular posterior medial parietal lateral temporal medial prefrontal areas effect strongest right entorhinal cortex coherence directional signal across entorhinal cortex correlated spatial memory performance study illustrates potential power combining single-unit electrophysiology fmri systems neuroscience results provide evidence grid-cell-like representations humans implicate specific type neural representation network regions supports spatial cognition also autobiographical memory
