ctd tyrosine phosphorylation impairs termination factor recruitment rna polymerase ii 
different phases transcription cycle rna polymerase pol ii recruits various factors via c-terminal domain ctd consists conserved heptapeptide repeats sequence tyr1-ser2-pro3-thr4-ser5-pro6-ser7 show ctd transcribing yeast pol ii phosphorylated tyr1 addition ser2 thr4 ser5 ser7 tyr1 phosphorylation stimulates binding elongation factor spt6 impairs recruitment termination factors nrd1 pcf11 rtt103 tyr1 phosphorylation levels rise downstream transcription start site decrease polyadenylation site largely excluding termination factors gene bodies results show ctd modifications trigger block factor recruitment lead extended ctd code explains transcription cycle coordination basis differential phosphorylation tyr1 ser2 ser5
