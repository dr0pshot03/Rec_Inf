unique redundant connexin contributions lens development 
connexin genes encode intercellular channels help coordinate development mice targeted deletion different connexins produces disparate effects ocular growth differentiation tens need multiple channel subunits poorly understood knockout cx46 causes loss homeostasis cataracts deletion cx50 results reduced ocular growth cataracts targeted replacement cx50 cx46 genetic knock-in corrected defects cellular differentiation prevented cataracts restore normal growth data show intrinsic properties cx50 required cellular growth whereas nonspecific restoration communication cx46 maintained differentiation
