chemical investigation hassium element
periodic table provides classification chemical properties elements heaviest elements transactinides role periodic table reaches limits increasingly strong relativistic effects valence electron shells can induce deviations known trends chemical properties- case first two transactinides elements relativistic effects indeed influence chemical properties whereas elements behave expected position within periodic table report chemical separation characterization seven detected atoms element hassium hs generated isotopes hs refs hs ref fusion reaction mg cm- hassium atoms immediately oxidized highly volatile oxide presumably hso determine enthalpy adsorption detector surface comparable adsorption enthalpy determined identical conditions osmium oxide oso4 results provide evidence chemical properties hassium lighter homologue osmium similar thus confirming hassium exhibits properties expected position group periodic table
