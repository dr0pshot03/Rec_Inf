chiral route negative refraction
negative refraction currently achieved driving magnetic permeability electrical permittivity simultaneously negative thus requiring two separate resonances refracting material introduction single chiral resonance leads negative refraction one polarization resulting improved simplified designs negatively refracting materials opening previously unknown avenues investigation fast-growing subject
