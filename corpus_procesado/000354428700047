pirna-guided slicing specifies transcripts zucchini-dependent phased pirna biogenesis 
animal gonads piwi-clade argonaute proteins repress transposons sequence-specifically via bound piwi-interacting rnas pirnas processed single-stranded precursor rnas largely unknown mechanisms show primary pirna biogenesis -directed phased process drosophila germ line initiated secondary pirna-guided transcript cleavage phasing results consecutive endonucleolytic cleavages catalyzed zucchini implying coupled formation ends flanking pirnas unexpectedly zucchini also participates end formation secondary pirnas function can however bypassed downstream pirna-guided precursor cleavages coupled exonucleolytic trimming data uncover evolutionarily conserved pirna biogenesis mechanism zucchini plays central role defining pirna ends
