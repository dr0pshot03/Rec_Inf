greenland temperature response climate forcing last deglaciation 
greenland ice core water isotopic composition delta o- provides detailed evidence abrupt climate changes insufficient quantitative reconstruction past temperatures spatial patterns investigate greenland temperature evolution last deglaciation using independent reconstructions three ice cores simulations coupled ocean-atmosphere climate model contrary traditional delta o interpretation younger dryas period degrees +/ degrees c warmer oldest dryas due increased carbon dioxide forcing summer insolation magnitude abrupt temperature changes larger central greenland degrees degrees c northwest degrees degrees c fingerprinting north atlantic origin simulated changes temperature seasonality closely track changes atlantic overturning strength support hypothesis abrupt climate change mostly winter phenomenon
