genetic evidence high-altitude adaptation tibet 
tibetans lived high altitudes thousands years distinctive suite physiological traits enable tolerate environmental hypoxia phenotypes clearly result adaptation environment genetic basis remains unknown report genome-wide scans reveal positive selection several regions contain genes whose products likely involved high-altitude adaptation positively selected haplotypes egln1 ppara significantly associated decreased hemoglobin phenotype unique highland population identification genes provides support previously hypothesized mechanisms high-altitude adaptation illuminates complexity hypoxia-response pathways humans
