anp32e histone chaperone removes h2az chromatin 
h2az essential histone variant implicated regulation key nuclear events however metazoan chaperones responsible h2az deposition removal chromatin remain unknown report identification characterization human protein anp32e specific h2az chaperone show anp32e member presumed h2az histone-exchange complex p400/tip60 anp32e interacts short region docking domain h2az new motif termed h2az interacting domain zid angstrom resolution crystal structure complex formed anp32e-zid h2az/h2b dimer biochemical data support underlying molecular mechanism h2az/h2b eviction nucleosome stabilization anp32e specific extension h2az carboxy-terminal alpha-helix finally analysis h2az localization anp32e-/- cells chromatin immunoprecipitation followed sequencing shows genome-wide enrichment redistribution accumulation h2az specific chromatin control regions particular enhancers insulators
