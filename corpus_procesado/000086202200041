insect population control using dominant repressible lethal genetic system
major modification sterile insect technique described transgenic insects homozygous dominant repressible female-specific lethal gene system used demonstrate two methods give required genetic characteristics otherwise wild-type genetic background first system uses sex-specific promoter enhancer drive expression repressible transcription factor turn controls expression toxic gene product second system uses non-sex-specific expression repressible transcription factor regulate selectively lethal gene product methods work efficiently drosophila melanogaster expect principles widely applicable economically important organisms
