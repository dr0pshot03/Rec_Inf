mammalian micrornas predominantly act decrease target mrna levels
micrornas mirnas endogenous similar nucleotide rnas mediate important gene-regulatory events pairing mrnas protein-coding genes direct repression repression regulatory targets leads decreased translational efficiency and/or decreased mrna levels relative contributions two outcomes largely unknown particularly endogenous targets expressed low-to-moderate levels use ribosome profiling measure overall effects protein production compare simultaneously measured effects mrna levels ectopic endogenous mirna regulatory interactions lowered mrna levels account > % decreased protein production results show changes mrna levels closely reflect impact mirnas gene expression indicate destabilization target mrnas predominant reason reduced protein output
