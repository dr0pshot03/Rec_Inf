widespread impact mammalian micrornas mrna repression evolution 
thousands mammalian messenger rnas selective pressure maintain nucleotide sites matching micrornas mirnas found conserved targets often highly expressed developmental stages mirna expression levels tend fall mirna targets begins accumulate nonconserved sites outnumber conserved sites also mediate repression consequence genes preferentially expressed time place mirna evolved selectively avoid sites matching mirna phenomenon selective avoidance extends thousands genes enables spatial temporal specificities mirnas revealed finding tissues developmental stages messages corresponding sites expressed lower levels
