seismic evidence hotspot-induced buoyant flow beneath reykjanes ridge 
volcanic hotspots mid-ocean ridge spreading centers surface expressions upwelling earths mantle convection system interaction provides unique information upwelling dynamics investigated influence iceland hotspot adjacent mid-atlantic spreading center using phase-delay times seismic surface waves show anomalous polarization anisotropy-a delay-time discrepancy waves different polarizations anisotropy implies hotspot induces buoyancy-driven upwelling mantle beneath ridge
