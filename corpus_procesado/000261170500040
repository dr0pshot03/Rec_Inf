sarcolemma-localized nnos required maintain activity mild exercise 
many neuromuscular conditions characterized exaggerated exercise induced fatigue response disproportionate activity level fatigue necessarily correlated greater central peripheral fatigue patients patients experience severe fatigue without demonstrable somatic disease except myopathies due specific metabolic defects mechanism underlying type fatigue remains unknown treatment available form inactivity major determinant disability show using mouse models exaggerated fatigue response distinct loss specific force production muscle sarcolemma-localized signalling neuronal nitric oxide synthase nnos skeletal muscle required maintain activity mild exercise show nnos null mice muscle pathology loss muscle specific force exercise display exaggerated fatigue response mild exercise mouse models nnos mislocalization sarcolemma prolonged inactivity relieved pharmacologically enhancing cgmp signal results muscle nnos activation nitric oxide signalling response mild exercise findings suggest mechanism underlying exaggerated fatigue response mild exercise lack contraction induced signalling sarcolemma localized nnos decreases cgmp mediated vasomodulation vessels supply active muscle mild exercise sarcolemmal nnos staining decreased patient biopsies large number distinct myopathies suggesting common mechanism fatigue results suggest patients exaggerated fatigue response mild exercise show clinical improvement response treatment strategies aimed improving exercise induced signalling
