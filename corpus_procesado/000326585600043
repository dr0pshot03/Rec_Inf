dendritic spikes enhance stimulus selectivity cortical neurons vivo 
neuronal dendrites electrically excitable: can generate regenerative events dendritic spikes response sufficiently strong synaptic input- although events observed many neuronal types- well understood active dendrites contribute tuning neuronal output vivo show dendritic spikes increase selectivity neuronal responses orientation visual stimulus orientation tuning performed direct patch-clamp recordings dendrites pyramidal neurons primary visual cortex lightly anaesthetized awake mice sensory processing visual stimulation triggered regenerative local dendritic spikes distinct back-propagating action potentials events orientation tuned suppressed either hyperpolarization membrane potential intracellular blockade nmdan-methyl-d-aspartate receptors manipulations also decreased selectivity subthreshold orientation tuning measured soma thus linking dendritic regenerative events somatic orientation tuning together results suggest dendritic spikes triggered visual input contribute fundamental cortical computation: enhancing orientation selectivity visual cortex thus dendritic excitability essential component behaviourally relevant computations neurons
