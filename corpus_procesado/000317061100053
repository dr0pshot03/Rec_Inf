transposition-driven genomic heterogeneity drosophila brain 
recent studies mammals documented neural expression mobility retrotransposons suggested neural genomes diverse mosaics found transposition occurs among memory-relevant neurons drosophila brain cell type-specific gene expression profiling revealed transposon expression abundant mushroom body mb alpha beta neurons neighboring mb neurons piwi-interacting rna pirna proteins aubergine argonaute known suppress transposons fly germline expressed brain appear less abundant alpha beta mb neurons loss pirna proteins correlates elevated transposon expression brain paired-end deep sequencing identified de novo transposon insertions alpha beta neurons including insertions memory-relevant loci observations indicate genomic heterogeneity conserved feature brain
