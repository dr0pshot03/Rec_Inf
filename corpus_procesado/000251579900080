optical rogue waves
recent observations show probability encountering extremely large rogue wave open ocean much larger expected ordinary wave amplitude statistics- although considerable effort directed towards understanding physics behind mysterious potentially destructive events complete picture remains uncertain furthermore rogue waves yet observed physical systems introduce concept optical rogue waves counterpart infamous rare water waves using new real time detection technique study system exposes extremely steep large waves rare outcomes almost identically prepared initial population waves specifically report observation rogue waves optical system based microstructured optical fibre near threshold soliton fission supercontinuum generation noise sensitive- nonlinear process extremely broadband radiation generated narrowband input model generation rogue waves using generalized nonlinear schrodinger equation demonstrate arise infrequently initially smooth pulses owing power transfer seeded small noise perturbation
