pep1 regulates perennial flowering arabis alpina
annual plants complete life cycle one year initiate flowering whereas perennials live many years flower repeatedly perennials undergo repeated cycles vegetative growth flowering synchronized changing seasons extensively studied flowering best understood annual arabidopsis thaliana many closely related species arabis alpina perennials identified alpina mutant perpetual flowering pep1 showed pep1 contributes three perennial traits limits duration flowering facilitating return vegetative development prevents branches undergoing floral transition allowing polycarpic growth habit confers flowering response winter temperatures restricts flowering spring show pep1 orthologue thaliana gene flowering locus c flc flc transcription factor inhibits flowering thaliana exposed winter temperatures trigger chromatin modifications stably repress flc transcription- contrast pep1 transiently repressed low temperatures causing repeated seasonal cycles repression activation pep1 transcription allow carry functions characteristic cyclical life history perennials patterns chromatin modifications flc pep1 differ correlating distinct expression patterns thus describe critical mechanism flowering regulation differs related perennial annual species propose differences chromatin regulation contribute variation
