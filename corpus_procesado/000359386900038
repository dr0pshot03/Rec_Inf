crucial hsp70 co-chaperone complex unlocks metazoan protein disaggregation
protein aggregates hallmark stressed ageing cells characterize several pathophysiological states healthy metazoan cells effectively eliminate intracellular protein aggregates indicating efficient disaggregation and/or degradation mechanisms exist however metazoans lack key heat-shock protein disaggregase hsp100 non-metazoan hsp70-dependent protein disaggregation systems human hsp70 system alone even crucial hsp110 nucleotide exchange factor poor disaggregation activity vitro4 unresolved conundrum central protein quality control biology show synergic cooperation complexed j-protein co-chaperones classes b unleashes highly efficient protein disaggregation activity human nematode hsp70 systems metazoan mixed-class j-protein complexes transient involve complementary charged regions conserved j-domains carboxy-terminal domains j-protein class flexible respect subunit composition complex formation allows j-proteins initiate transient higher order chaperone structures involving hsp70 interacting nucleotide exchange factors network cooperative class b j-protein interactions therefore provides metazoan hsp70 machinery powerful flexible finely regulatable disaggregase activity level regulation crucial cellular protein quality control
