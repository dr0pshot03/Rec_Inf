integrative annotation variants humans: application cancer genomics
interpreting variants especially noncoding ones increasing number personal genomes challenging used patterns polymorphisms functionally annotated regions humans identify deleterious variants experimentally validated candidates analyzed coding noncoding regions former corroborating latter found regions particularly sensitive mutations ultrasensitive variants disruptive mechanistic effects transcription-factor binding motif-breakers also found variants regions higher network centrality tend deleterious insertions deletions followed similar pattern single-nucleotide variants notable exceptions e g certain deletions enhancers basis patterns developed computational tool funseq whose application similar cancer genomes reveals nearly hundred candidate noncoding drivers
