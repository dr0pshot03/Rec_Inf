myc-driven endogenous cell competition early mammalian embryo 
epiblast mammalian embryonic tissue contains pluripotent stem cells generate whole embryo established method inducing functional genetic mosaics mouse using system show induction mosaic imbalance myc expression epiblast provokes expansion cells higher myc levels apoptotic elimination cells lower levels without disrupting development contrast homogeneous shifts myc levels affect epiblast cell viability indicating observed competition results comparison relative myc levels epiblast cells normal development found myc levels intrinsically heterogeneous among epiblast cells endogenous cell competition refines epiblast cell population elimination cells low relative myc levels results show natural cell competition early mammalian embryo contributes selection epiblast cell pool
