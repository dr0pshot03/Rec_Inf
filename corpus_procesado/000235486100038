adaptive filtering enhances information transmission visual cortex
sensory neuroscience seeks understand brain encodes natural environments however neural coding largely studied using simplified stimuli order assess whether brains coding strategy depends stimulus ensemble apply new information-theoretic method allows unbiased calculation neural filters receptive fields responses natural scenes complex signals strong multipoint correlations cat primary visual cortex compare responses natural inputs noise inputs matched luminance contrast find neural filters adaptively change input ensemble increase information carried neural response filtered stimulus adaptation affects spatial frequency composition filter enhancing sensitivity under-represented frequencies agreement optimal encoding arguments adaptation occurs s many minutes longer previously reported forms adaptation
