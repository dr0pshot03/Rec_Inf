synthesis mobius aromatic hydrocarbon 
defining feature aromatic hydrocarbon compounds cyclic molecular structure stabilized delocalization pi electrons according huckel rule need total 4n + n cyclic compounds 4n pi electrons antiaromatic unstable heilbronner predicted purely theoretical grounds cyclic molecules topology mobius band ring constructed joining ends rectangular strip given one end half twist aromatic contain 4n rather 4n p electrons prediction stimulated attempts synthesize mobius aromatic hydrocarbons twisted cyclic molecules destabilized large ring strains twist also suppressing overlap p orbitals involved electron delocalization stabilization larger cyclic molecules ring strain less pronounced structures flexible flip back less-strained huckel topology although transition-state species unstable intermediate non-conjugated cyclic molecule mobius topology documented stable aromatic mobius system yet realized report combining normal aromatic structure p orbitals orthogonal ring plane belt-like aromatic structure p orbitals within ring plane yields mobius compound stabilized extended pi system
