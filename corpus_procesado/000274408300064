repulsion superinfecting virions: mechanism rapid virus spread 
viruses thought spread across susceptible cells iterative process infection replication release rate spread limited replication kinetics show vaccinia virus spreads across one cell every minutes fourfold faster replication cycle permit explain phenomenon found newly infected cells express two surface proteins mark cells infected via exploitation cellular machinery induce repulsion superinfecting virions away toward uninfected cells mechanistically early expression proteins a33 a36 critical virion repulsion rapid spread cells expressing proteins repelled exogenous virions rapidly additional spreading mechanisms may exist viruses also spread faster predicted replication kinetics
