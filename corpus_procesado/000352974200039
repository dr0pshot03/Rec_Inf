thirst driving suppressing signals encoded distinct neural populations brain
thirst basic instinct drink water previously shown neurons several circumventricular organs hypothalamus activated thirst-inducing conditions identify two distinct genetically separable neural populations subfornical organ trigger suppress thirst show optogenetic activation subfornical organ excitatory neurons marked expression transcription factor etv- evokes intense drinking behaviour even fully water-satiated animals light-induced response highly specific water immediate strictly locked laser stimulus contrast activation second population subfornical organ neurons marked expression vesicular gaba transporter vgat drastically suppresses drinking even water-craving thirsty animals results reveal innate brain circuit can turn animals water-drinking behaviour probably functions centre thirst control mammalian brain
