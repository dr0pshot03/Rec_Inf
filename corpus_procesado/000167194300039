coherent manipulation semiconductor quantum bits terahertz radiation
quantum bits- qubits fundamental building blocks quantum information processors quantum computers qubit comprises pair well characterized quantum states can principle manipulated quickly compared time takes decohere coupling environment much remains understood manipulation decoherence semiconductor qubits show hydrogen-atom-like motional states electrons bound donor impurities currently available semiconductors can serve model qubits use intense pulses terahertz radiation induce coherent damped rabi oscillations population two low-lying states donor impurities gaas11- observations demonstrate quantum-confined extrinsic electron semiconductor can coherently manipulated like atomic electron even sharing space similar atoms semiconductor host anticipate model system will useful measuring intrinsic decoherence processes testing simple complex manipulations semiconductor qubits
