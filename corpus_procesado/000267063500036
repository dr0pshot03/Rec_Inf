strong tidal dissipation io jupiter astrometric observations
io volcanically active body solar system large surface heat flux- geological activity thought result tides raised jupiter known whether current tidal heat production sufficiently high generate observed surface heat flow ios tidal heat comes orbital energy io-jupiter system resulting orbital acceleration whereas dissipation energy jupiter causes ios orbital motion decelerate report determination tidal dissipation io jupiter effect orbital motions galilean moons results show rate internal energy dissipation io k/q +/ k love number q quality factor good agreement observed surface heat flow5 suggest io close thermal equilibrium dissipation jupiter k/q +/ x - close upper bound average value expected long-term evolution system dissipation extrasolar planets may higher presently assumed measured secular accelerations indicate io evolving inwards towards jupiter three innermost galilean moons io europa ganymede evolving exact laplace resonance
