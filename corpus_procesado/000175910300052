pathway primate brain internal monitoring movements
essential keep track movements make one way monitor correlates corollary discharges neuronal movement commands hypothesized previously identified pathway brainstem frontal cortex might carry corollary discharge signals found neuronal activity pathway encodes upcoming eye movements inactivating pathway impairs sequential eye movements consistent loss corollary discharge without affecting single eye movements results identify pathway brain primate macaca mulatta conveys corollary discharge signals
