semiconductor source triggered entangled photon pairs 
entangled photon pairs important resource quantum optics essential quantum information applications quantum key distribution controlled quantum logic operations radiative decay biexcitons states consisting two bound electron hole pairs quantum dot proposed source triggered polarization-entangled photon pairs date however experiments indicated splitting intermediate exciton energy yields classically correlated emission- demonstrate triggered photon pair emission single quantum dots suggestive polarization entanglement achieve tuning splitting zero either application in-plane magnetic field careful control growth conditions entangled photon pairs generated demand significant fundamental advantages schemes- can suffer multiple pair emission require post-selection techniques use photon-number discriminating detectors furthermore control pair generation time essential scaling many quantum information schemes beyond gates results suggest triggered entangled photon pair source implemented simple semiconductor light-emitting diode
