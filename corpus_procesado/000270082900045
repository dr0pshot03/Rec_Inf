active turnover modulates mature microrna activity caenorhabditis elegans 
micrornas mirnas constitute large class regulatory rnas repress target messenger rnas control various biological processes1 accordingly mirna biogenesis highly regulated controlled transcriptional post-transcriptional levels2 overexpression underexpression mirnas linked various human diseases particularly cancers13 rna concentrations generally function biogenesis turnover active mirna degradation might also modulate mirna accumulation plant -> exonuclease sdn1 implicated mirna turnover4 report degradation mature mirnas nematode caenorhabditis elegans mediated -> exoribonuclease xrn- affects functional mirna homeostasis vivo recapitulate xrn--dependent mirna turnover larval lysates processing precursor-mirna pre-mirna dicer unannealing mirna duplex loading mature mirna argonaute protein mirna-induced silencing complex mirisc coupled processes precede degradation mature mirna although argonaute: mirna complexes highly resistant salt larval lysate promotes efficient release mirna exposing degradation xrn- release degradation can blocked addition mirna target rna results therefore suggest presence additional layer regulation animal mirna activity might important rapid changes mirna expression profiles developmental transitions maintenance steady-state concentrations mirnas pathway might represent potential target therapeutic intervention mirna expression
