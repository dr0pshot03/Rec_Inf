role duplicate genes genetic robustness null mutations 
deleting gene organism often little phenotypic effect- owing two mechanisms compensation- first existence duplicate genes: loss function one copy can compensated copy copies second mechanism compensation stems alternative metabolic pathways regulatory networks relative importance two mechanisms investigated except limited study suggested role duplicate genes compensation negligible availability fitness data nearly complete set single-gene-deletion mutants saccharomyces cerevisiae genome enabled us carry genome-wide evaluation role duplicate genes genetic robustness null mutations show significantly higher probability functional compensation duplicate gene singleton high correlation frequency compensation sequence similarity two duplicates higher probability severe fitness effect duplicate copy highly expressed deleted estimate s cerevisiae least quarter gene deletions phenotype compensated duplicate genes
