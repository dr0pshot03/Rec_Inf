germline allele-specific expression tgfbr1 confers increased risk colorectal cancer
much genetic predisposition colorectal cancer crc humans unexplained studying caucasian dominated population united states showed germline allele specific expression ase gene encoding transforming growth factor-beta tgf-beta type receptor tgfbr1 quantitative trait occurs % crc patients % controls ase results reduced expression gene dominantly inherited segregates families occurs sporadic crc cases although subtle reduction constitutive tgfbr1 expression alters smad mediated tgf-beta signaling two major tgfbr1 haplotypes predominant among ase cases suggests ancestral mutations causative germline changes identified conservative estimates suggest ase confers substantially increased risk crc odds ratio % confidence interval estimates require confirmation will probably show ethnic differences
