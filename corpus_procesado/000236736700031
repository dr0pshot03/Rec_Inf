chemokines enhance immunity guiding naive cd8+ t cells sites cd4 t cell-dendritic cell interaction 
cd8+ t cells crucial role resistance pathogens can kill malignant cells however critical functions lymphocytes depend helper activity provided distinct population cd4+ t cells cooperation lymphocyte subsets involves recognition antigens co-presented dendritic cell frequencies antigen-bearing cells early infection relevant naive t cells low suggests active mechanism facilitates necessary cell-cell associations demonstrate immunization antigen recognition naive cd8+ t cells immunogen-draining lymph nodes upregulate chemokine receptor ccr5 permitting cells attracted sites antigen-specific dendritic cell-cd4+ t cell interaction cognate chemokines ccl3 ccl4 also known mip alpha mip beta produced interference actively guided recruitment markedly reduces ability cd4+ t cells promote memory cd8+ t-cell generation indicating orchestrated series differentiation events drives nonrandom cell-cell interactions within lymph nodes optimizing cd8+ t-cell immune responses involving antigen-specific precursors present naive repertoire
