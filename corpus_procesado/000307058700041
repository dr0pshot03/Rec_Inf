aerosols overseas rival domestic emissions north america 
many types aerosols lifetimes long enough transcontinental transport making potentially important contributors air quality climate change remote locations estimate mass aerosols arriving north american shores overseas comparable total mass particulates emitted domestically curbing domestic emissions particulates precursor gases therefore sufficient mitigate aerosol impacts north america imported contribution dominated dust leaving asia combustion-generated particles thus even reduction industrial emissions emerging economies asia overwhelmed increase dust emissions due changes meteorological conditions potential desertification
