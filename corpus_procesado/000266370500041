bacteria hijack integrin-linked kinase stabilize focal adhesions block cell detachment 
rapid turnover exfoliation mucosal epithelial cells provides innate defence system bacterial infection nevertheless many pathogenic bacteria including shigella able surmount exfoliation colonize epithelium efficiently show shigella flexneri effector ospe consisting ospe1 ospe2 proteins highly conserved among enteropathogenic escherichia coli enterohaemorrhagic e coli citrobacter rodentium salmonella strains reinforces host cell adherence basement membrane interacting integrin-linked kinase ilk number focal adhesions augmented along membrane fraction ilk ilk-ospe binding interaction ilk ospe increased cell surface levels beta integrin suppressed phosphorylation focal adhesion kinase paxillin required rapid turnover focal adhesion cell motility nocodazole-washout-induced focal adhesion disassembly blocked expression ospe polarized epithelial cells infected shigella mutant lacking ospe gene underwent rapid cell detachment cells infected wild-type shigella infection guinea pig colons shigella corroborated pivotal role ospe-ilk interaction suppressing epithelial detachment increasing bacterial cell-to-cell spreading promoting bacterial colonization results indicate shigella sustain infectious foothold using special tactics prevent detachment infected cells
