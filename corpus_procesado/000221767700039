positive selection sites multiple amino acid replacements since rat-mouse divergence 
new alleles become fixed owing random drift nearly neutral mutations positive selection substantially advantageous mutations1- decades debate fraction fixations driven selection remains uncertain4- within genes analysed codons rat mouse differ two nucleotide sites codons three differences codons rat-mouse divergence involved two non-synonymous substitutions occurred lineage either rat mouse % cases; however independent substitutions occur lineage probability % three non-synonymous substitutions occurred lineage % codons instead % expected furthermore comparison pairs prokaryotic genomes also shows clumping multiple nonsynonymous substitutions lineage pattern explained correlated mutation episodes relaxed negative selection instead indicates positive selection acts many sites rapid successive amino acid replacement
