element-selective single atom imaging 
electron energy-loss spectroscopy eels widely used identify elemental compositions materials studied microscopy demonstrate sensitivity spatial resolution eels can extended single-atom limit chemical map gadolinium cd clearly reveals distribution cd atoms inside single chain metallofullerene molecules gd@c- generated within single-wall carbon nanotube characterization technique thus provides "eyes" see identify individual atoms nanostructures likely find broad application nanoscale science technology research
