autophagy metabolism 
autophagy process self-cannibalization cells capture cytoplasm organelles consume lysosomes resulting breakdown products inputs cellular metabolism used generate energy build new proteins membranes autophagy preserves health cells tissues replacing outdated damaged cellular components fresh ones starvation provides internal source nutrients energy generation thus survival powerful promoter metabolic homeostasis cellular whole-animal level autophagy prevents degenerative diseases downside however-cancer cells exploit survive nutrient-poor tumors
