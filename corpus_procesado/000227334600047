image segmentation lightness perception 
perception surface albedo lightness one basic aspects visual awareness well known apparent lightness target depends context embedded- extensive debate computations representations underlying perceived lightness one view asserts visual system explicitly separates surface reflectance prevailing illumination atmospheric conditions embedded- generating layered image representations recent theory challenged view asserted human visual system derives surface lightness without explicitly segmenting images multiple layers present new lightness illusions largest reported date unequivocally demonstrate effect layered image representations can lightness perception show computations underlie decomposition luminance multiple layers conditions transparency can induce dramatic lightness illusions causing identical texture patches appear either black white results indicate mechanisms involved decomposing images layered representations can play decisive role perception surface lightness
