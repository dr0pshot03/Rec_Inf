promoting axon regeneration adult cns modulation pten/mtor pathway
failure axons regenerate major obstacle functional recovery central nervous system cns injury removing extracellular inhibitory molecules results limited axon regeneration vivo test role intrinsic impediments axon regrowth analyzed cell growth control genes using virus assisted vivo conditional knockout approach deletion pten phosphatase tensin homolog negative regulator mammalian target rapamycin mtor pathway adult retinal ganglion cells rgcs promotes robust axon regeneration optic nerve injury wild type adult mice mtor activity suppressed new protein synthesis impaired axotomized rgcs may contribute regeneration failure reactivating pathway conditional knockout tuberous sclerosis complex another negative regulator mtor pathway also leads axon regeneration thus results suggest manipulation intrinsic growth control pathways therapeutic approach promote axon regeneration cns injury
