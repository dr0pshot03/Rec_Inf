multiple exciton collection sensitized photovoltaic system 
multiple exciton generation creation two electron-hole pairs one high-energy photon well established bulk semiconductors assessments efficiency effect remain controversial quantum-confined systems like semiconductor nanocrystals used photoelectrochemical system composed pbs nanocrystals chemically bound tio single crystals demonstrate collection photocurrents quantum yields greater one electron per photon strong electronic coupling favorable energy level alignment pbs nanocrystals bulk tio facilitate extraction multiple excitons quickly recombine well collection hot electrons higher quantum dot excited states results implications increasing efficiency photovoltaic devices avoiding losses resulting thermalization photogenerated carriers
