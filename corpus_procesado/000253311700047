spine-type-specific recruitment newly synthesized ampa receptors learning
stabilization long term memories requires de novo protein synthesis can proteins synthesized soma act specific synapses participate given memory studied dynamics newly synthesized ampa type glutamate receptors ampars induced learning using transgenic mice expressing glur1 subunit fused green fluorescent protein gfp glur1 control c fos promoter found learning associated recruitment newly synthesized gfp glur1 selectively mushroom type spines adult hippocampal ca1 neurons hours fear conditioning results consistent synaptic tagging model allow activated synapses subsequently capture newly synthesized receptor also demonstrate critical functional distinction mushroom spines learning
