secreted kinase phosphorylates extracellular proteins regulate biomineralization
protein phosphorylation fundamental mechanism regulating nearly every aspect cellular life several secreted proteins phosphorylated kinases responsible unknown identified family atypical protein kinases localize within golgi apparatus secreted fam20c appears golgi casein kinase phosphorylates secretory pathway proteins within s-x-e motifs fam20c phosphorylates caseins several secreted proteins implicated biomineralization including small integrin-binding ligand n-linked glycoproteins siblings consequently mutations fam20c cause osteosclerotic bone dysplasia humans known raine syndrome fam20c thus protein kinase dedicated phosphorylation extracellular proteins
