evolution molecular machines protein import mitochondria 
creating mitochondria billion years ago first eukaryotes needed establish protein import machinery membranes bacterial endosymbiont preexisting protein translocation apparatus endosymbiont appears commandeered including molecular chaperones signal peptidase components protein-targeting machinery however protein translocases drive protein import mitochondria obvious counterparts bacteria making likely machines created de novo presence similar translocase subunits eukaryotic genomes sequenced date suggests eukaryotes can considered descendants single ancestor species carried ancestral protomitochondria
