cortical constriction abscission involves helices escrt-iii-dependent filaments 
partitioning cytoplasmic contents cleavage furrow ingression animal cells remain connected intercellular bridge subsequently splits abscission examined intermediate stages abscission human cells using live imaging three-dimensional structured illumination microscopy electron tomography identified helices -nanometer-diameter filaments narrowed cortex intercellular bridge single stalk endosomal sorting complex required transport escrt-iii co-localized constriction zones required assembly -nanometer-diameter filaments simultaneous spastin-mediated removal underlying microtubules enabled full constriction abscission site identification contractile filament helices intercellular bridge broad implications understanding cell division escrt-iii-mediated fission large membrane structures
