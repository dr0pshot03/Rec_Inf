role dna shape protein-dna recognition
recognition specific dna sequences proteins thought depend two types mechanism: one involves formation hydrogen bonds specific bases primarily major groove one involving sequence-dependent deformations dna helix comprehensively analysing three-dimensional structures protein-dna complexes show binding arginine residues narrow minor grooves widely used mode protein-dna recognition readout mechanism exploits phenomenon narrow minor grooves strongly enhance negative electrostatic potential dna nucleosome core particle offers prominent example effect minor-groove narrowing often associated presence a-tracts at-rich sequences exclude flexible tpa step findings indicate ability detect local variations dna shape electrostatic potential general mechanism enables proteins use information minor groove otherwise offers opportunities formation base-specific hydrogen bonds achieve dna-binding specificity
