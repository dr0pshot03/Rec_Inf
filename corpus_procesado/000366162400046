vitamin c selectively kills kras braf mutant colorectal cancer cells targeting gapdh
half human colorectal cancers crcs carry either kras braf mutations often refractory approved targeted therapies found cultured human crc cells harboring kras braf mutations selectively killed exposed high levels vitamin c effect due increased uptake oxidized form vitamin c dehydroascorbate dha via glut1 glucose transporter increased dha uptake causes oxidative stress intracellular dha reduced vitamin c depleting glutathione thus reactive oxygen species accumulate inactivate glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase gapdh inhibition gapdh highly glycolytic kras braf mutant cells leads energetic crisis cell death seen kras braf wild-type cells high-dose vitamin c impairs tumor growth apc/krasg12d mutant mice results provide mechanistic rationale exploring therapeutic use vitamin c crcs kras braf mutations
