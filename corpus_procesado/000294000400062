mutational inactivation stag2 causes aneuploidy human cancer 
cancer cells characterized aneuploidy abnormal number chromosomes identified clue mechanistic origins aneuploidy integrative genomic analyses human tumors diverse range tumor types found harbor deletions inactivating mutations stag2 gene encoding subunit cohesin complex regulates separation sister chromatids cell division stag2 x chromosome inactivation requires single mutational event studying near-diploid human cell line stable karyotype found targeted inactivation stag2 led chromatid cohesion defects aneuploidy whereas two aneuploid human glioblastoma cell lines targeted correction endogenous mutant alleles stag2 led enhanced chromosomal stability thus genetic disruption cohesin cause aneuploidy human cancer
