regulation aging age-related disease daf heat-shock factor 
caenorhabditis elegans transcription factor hsf- regulates heat-shock response also influences aging reducing hsf activity accelerates tissue aging shortens life-span show hsf overexpression extends life-span find hsf- like transcription factor daf- required daf--insulin/igf receptor mutations extend life-span findings suggest hsf daf together activate expression specific genes including genes encoding small heat-shock proteins turn promote longevity small heat-shock proteins also delay onset polyglutamine-expansion protein aggregation suggesting proteins couple normal aging process type age-related disease
