c-kit+ cells minimally contribute cardiomyocytes heart 
heart regenerates injury event highly debated c-kit-expressing cardiac progenitor cells reported primary source generation new myocardium injury generated two genetic approaches mice examine whether endogenous c-kit+ cells contribute differentiated cardiomyocytes heart development ageing injury adulthood complementary dna encoding either cre recombinase tamoxifen-inducible mercremer chimaeric protein targeted kit locus mice bred reporter lines permanently mark cell lineage endogenous c-kit+ cells produce new cardiomyocytes within heart although percentage approximately less preponderance towards cellular fusion considered percentage falls approximately contrast c-kit+ cells amply generated cardiac endothelial cells thus endogenous c-kit+ cells cangenerate cardiomyocytes within heart although probably functionally insignificant level
