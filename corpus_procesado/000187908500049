neural systems underlying suppression unwanted memories
century ago freud proposed unwanted memories can excluded awareness process called repression unknown however repression occurs brain used functional magnetic resonance imaging identify neural systems involved keeping unwanted memories awareness controlling unwanted memories associated increased dorsolateral prefrontal activation reduced hippocampal activation impaired retention memories prefrontal cortical right hippocampal activations predicted magnitude forgetting results confirm existence active forgetting process establish neurobiological model guiding inquiry motivated forgetting
