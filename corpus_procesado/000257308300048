chemotaxis caenorhabditis elegans like chemotaxis bacteria involves random walk biased time derivative attractant concentration derivative computed unknown laser ablations shown strongest deficits chemotaxis salts obtained ase chemosensory neurons asel aser ablated indicating pair dominant role although neurons left right homologues anatomically exhibit marked asymmetries gene expression ion preference- using optical recordings calcium concentration ase neurons intact animals demonstrate additional asymmetry: asel cell stimulated increases nacl concentration whereas aser off-cell stimulated decreases nacl concentration responses reliable yet transient indicating ase neurons report changes concentration rather absolute levels recordings synaptic sensory transduction mutants show asymmetry result intrinsic differences ase neurons unilateral activation experiments indicate asymmetry extends level behavioural output: asel lengthens bouts forward locomotion runs whereas aser promotes direction changes turns notably input output asymmetries ase neurons precisely simple yet novel neuronal motif computing time derivative chemosensory information fundamental computation c elegans chemotaxis evidence cells chemosensory networks- suggests motif may common animals navigate taste smell
