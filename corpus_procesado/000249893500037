plasmacytoid dendritic cells sense self-dna coupled antimicrobial peptide
plasmacytoid dendritic cells pdcs sense viral microbial dna endosomal toll-like receptors produce type interferons pdcs normally respond self-dna restriction seems break human autoimmune disease yet poorly understood mechanism identify antimicrobial peptide ll37 also known camp key factor mediates pdc activation psoriasis common autoimmune disease skin ll37 converts inert self-dna potent trigger interferon production binding dna form aggregated condensed structures delivered retained within early endocytic compartments pdcs trigger toll-like receptor thus data uncover fundamental role endogenous antimicrobial peptide breaking innate tolerance self-dna suggest pathway may drive autoimmunity psoriasis
