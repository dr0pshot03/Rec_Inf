subducted seamount imaged rupture zone nankaido earthquake
nankai trough vigorous subduction zone large earthquakes recorded since seventh century recurrence time years nankaido earthquake unusual rupture zone estimated long-period geodetic data twice large derived shorter period seismic data center earthquake rupture zone used densely deployed ocean bottom seismographs detect subducted seamount kilometers thick kilometers wide depth kilometers propose seamount might work barrier inhibiting brittle seismogenic rupture
