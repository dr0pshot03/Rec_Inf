worldwide acceleration mountain erosion cooling climate 
climate influences erosion processes acting earths surface however effect cooling late cenozoic era including onset pliocene-pleistocene northern hemisphere glaciation two three million years ago global erosion rates remains unclear- uncertainty arises mainly lack consensus use sedimentary record proxy erosion difficulty isolating respective contributions tectonics climate erosion- compile bedrock thermochronometric ages around world use formal inversion procedure estimate temporal spatial variations erosion rates allows quantification erosion source areas ultimately produce sediment record timescale millions years find mountain erosion rates increased since six million years ago rapidly since two million years ago increase erosion rates observed latitudes pronounced glaciated mountain ranges indicating glacial processes played important part mountains represent considerable fraction global production sediments results imply increase sediment flux global scale coincides closely enhanced cooling pliocene pleistocene epochs
