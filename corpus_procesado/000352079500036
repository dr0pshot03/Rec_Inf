large thermal hall conductivity neutral spin excitations frustrated quantum magnet 
frustrated quantum magnets long-range magnetic order fails develop despite large exchange coupling spins contrast magnons conventional magnets spin excitations poorly understood show thermal hall conductivity kappaxy provides powerful probe spin excitations "quantum spin ice" pyrochlore tb2ti2o7 thermal hall response large even though material transparent hall response arises spin excitations specific characteristics distinguish magnons low temperature < kelvin thermal conductivity resembles dirty metal using hall angle construct phase diagram showing excitations suppressed magnetic field
