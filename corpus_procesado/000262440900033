binary origin blue stragglers globular clusters
blue stragglers globular clusters abnormally massive stars evolved stellar main sequence long ago two known processes can create objects: direct stellar collisions binary evolution however relative importance processes remained unclear particular total number blue stragglers found given cluster seem correlate predicted collision rate providing indirect support binary evolution model yet radial distributions blue stragglers many clusters bimodal dominant central peak-: interpreted indication collisions dominate blue straggler production least high density cluster cores report clear sublinear correlation number blue stragglers found cluster core total stellar mass contained within conclude blue stragglers even found cluster cores come binary systems parent binaries however may affected dynamical encounters may key reconciling seemingly conflicting results found date
