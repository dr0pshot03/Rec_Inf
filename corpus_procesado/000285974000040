rotational movement formin mdia1 along double helical strand actin filament
formin homology proteins formins elongate actin filaments f-actin continuously associating filament tips potentially harnessing actin-generated pushing forces processive elongation formins predicted rotate along axis double helical f-actin structure referred helical rotation although yet definitively shown demonstrated helical rotation formin mdia1 single-molecule fluorescence polarization flp flp labeled f-actin elongating depolymerizing immobilized mdia1 oscillated periodicity corresponding f-actin long-pitch helix altered actin-bound nucleotides actin-binding protein profilin thus helical rotation intrinsic property formins harness pushing forces growing f-actin formins must anchored flexibly cell structures
