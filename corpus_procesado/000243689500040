fish can infer social rank observation alone
transitive inference ti involves using known relationships deduce unknown ones example using b b c infer c thus essential logical reasoning first described developmental milestone children ti since reported nonhuman primates- rats birds- still animals acquire represent transitive relationships abilities might evolved remain open problems show male fish astatotilapia burtoni can successfully make inferences hierarchy implied pairwise fights rival males fish learned implied hierarchy vicariously bystanders watching fights rivals arranged around separate tank units findings show fish use ti trained socially relevant stimuli can make inferences using indirect information alone bystanders seem spatial featural representations related rival abilities can use make correct inferences depending kind information available beyond extending ti fish experimentally demonstrating indirect ti learning animals results indicate universal mechanism underlying ti unlikely rather animals probably use multiple domain-specific representations adapted different social ecological pressures encounter course natural lives
