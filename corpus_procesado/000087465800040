improving performance doped pi-conjugated polymers use organic light-emitting diodes
organic light-emitting diodes oleds represent promising technology large flexible lightweight flat-panel displays- devices consist one several semiconducting organic layers sandwiched two electrodes electric field applied electrons injected cathode lowest unoccupied molecular orbital adjacent molecules simultaneously holes injected anode highest occupied molecular orbital two types carriers migrate towards fraction recombine form excitons decay radiatively ground state spontaneous emission doped pi-conjugated polymer layers improve injection holes oled devices- thought result favourable work function injection layers compared commonly used layer material indium tin oxide demonstrate increasing doping level polymers barrier hole injection can continuously reduced use combinatorial devices allows us quickly screen optimum doping level apply concept oled devices hole-limited electroluminescence polyfluorene-based systems- finding possible significantly reduce operating voltage improving light output efficiency
