stars globular clusters generally believed formed time early galaxys history1 blue stragglers stars massive enough2 evolved white dwarfs long ago two possible mechanisms proposed formation: mass transfer binary companions3 stellar mergers resulting direct collisions two stars4 recently binary explanation claimed dominant5 report two distinct parallel sequences blue stragglers m globular cluster thought undergone core collapse collision rate mass transfer activity binary systems enhanced6 suggest two observed sequences consequence cluster core collapse bluer population arising direct stellar collisions redder one arising evolution close binaries probably still experiencing active phase mass transfer
