two distinct sequences blue straggler stars globular cluster m
stars globular clusters generally believed formed time early galaxys history blue stragglers stars massive enough evolved white dwarfs long ago two possible mechanisms proposed formation: mass transfer binary companions stellar mergers resulting direct collisions two stars recently binary explanation claimed dominant report two distinct parallel sequences blue stragglers m globular cluster thought undergone core collapse collision rate mass transfer activity binary systems enhanced suggest two observed sequences consequence cluster core collapse bluer population arising direct stellar collisions redder one arising evolution close binaries probably still experiencing active phase mass transfer
