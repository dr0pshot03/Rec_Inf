stress orientations subduction zones strength subduction megathrust faults 
subduction zone megathrust faults produce worlds largest earthquakes although physical properties faults difficult observe directly frictional strength can estimated indirectly constraining orientations stresses act global investigation stress orientations subduction zones finds maximum compressive stress axis plunges systematically trenchward consistently making angle degrees degrees respect subduction megathrust fault angles indicate megathrust fault substantially weaker surroundings together several lines evidence implies subduction zone megathrusts weak faults low-stress environment deforming outer accretionary wedge may decouple stress state along megathrust constraints free surface
