mitochondrial fusion intermediates revealed vitro
events occur fusion double-membraned mitochondria unknown essential step toward determining mechanism mitochondria fusion captured event vitro mitochondrial outer inner membrane fusion events separable mechanistically distinct required guanosine -triphosphate hydrolysis homotypic trans interactions ancient outer transmembrane guanosine triphosphatase fzo1 required promote fusion mitochondrial outer membranes whereas electrical potential also required fusion inner membranes conclusions provide fundamental insights molecular events driving mitochondrial fusion advance understanding evolution mitochondria fusion eukaryotic cells
