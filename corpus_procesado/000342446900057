aging-induced type interferon response choroid plexus negatively affects brain function
aging-associated cognitive decline affected factors produced inside outside brain using multiorgan genome-wide analysis aged mice found choroid plexus interface brain circulation shows type interferon ifn-i-dependent gene expression profile also found aged human brains aged mice response induced brain-derived signals present cerebrospinal fluid blocking ifn-i signaling within aged brain partially restored cognitive function hippocampal neurogenesis reestablished ifn-ii-dependent choroid plexus activity lost aging data identify chronic aging-induced ifn-i signature often associated antiviral response brains choroid plexus demonstrate negative influence brain function thereby suggesting target ameliorating cognitive decline aging
