voyager observes low-energy galactic cosmic rays region depleted heliospheric ions 
august voyager astronomical units steady intensity low-energy ions observed previous years suddenly dropped third time soon completely disappeared ions streamed away interstellar space although magnetic field observations indicate voyager remained inside heliosphere intensity cosmic ray nuclei outside heliosphere abruptly increased report spectra galactic cosmic rays similar x electron volts per nucleon revealing h energy spectra broad peaks x x electron volts per nucleon increasing galactic cosmic-ray electron intensity similar x electron volts
