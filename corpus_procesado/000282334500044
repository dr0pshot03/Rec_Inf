greater neural pattern similarity across repetitions associated better memory
repeated study improves memory underlying neural mechanisms improvement well understood using functional magnetic resonance imaging representational similarity analysis brain activity found compared forgotten items subsequently remembered faces words showed greater similarity neural activation across multiple study many brain regions including limited regions whose mean activities correlated subsequent memory result addresses longstanding debate study memory showing successful episodic memory encoding occurs neural representations precisely reactivated across study episodes rather patterns activation variable across time
