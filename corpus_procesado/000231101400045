antagonistic control disease resistance protein stability plant immune system
pathogen recognition plant immune system governed structurally related polymorphic products disease resistance r genes rar1 and/or sgt1b mediate function many r proteins rar1 controls preactivation r protein accumulation unknown mechanism demonstrate arabidopsis sgt1b two distinct genetically separable functions plant immune system: sgt1b antagonizes rar1 negatively regulate r protein accumulation infection sgt1b rar1-independent function regulates programmed cell death infection balanced activities rar1 sgt1 concert cytosolic hsp90 modulate preactivation r protein accumulation signaling competence
