cleaving carbon-carbon bonds inserting tungsten unstrained aromatic rings 
cleavage c-h c-c bonds transition metal centres fundamental interest plays important role synthesis complex organic molecules petroleum feedstocks1- many examples oxidative addition c-h bonds metal centre transformations feature oxidative addition c-c bonds rare paucity transformations involve cleavage c-c rather c-h bonds usually attributed kinetic factors arising greater steric hindrance directional nature spn hybrids form c-c bond thermodynamic factors arising fact m-c bonds weaker m-h bonds2- surprisingly therefore examples c-c bond cleavage either avoid kinetic limitations using metal compounds c-c bond held close proximity metal centre avoid thermodynamic limitations using organic substrates cleavage accompanied either relief strain energy formation aromatic system2- show tungsten centre can used cleave strong c-c bond component unstrained -membered aromatic ring cleavage enabled formation unusual chelating diisocyanide ligand suggests metal centres suitable ancillary ligands also accomplish cleavage strong c-c bonds aromatic substrates thereby provide new ways functionalizing molecules
