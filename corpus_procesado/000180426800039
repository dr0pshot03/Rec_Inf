spatiotemporal coherent control lattice vibrational waves 
achieved automated optical control coherent lattice responses time position-dependent across macroscopic length scales experiments spatiotemporal femtosecond pulse shaping used generate excitation light fields directed toward distinct regions crystalline samples producing terahertz-frequency lattice vibrational waves emanated outward multiple origins lightlike speeds interferences among waves resulted fully specified far-field responses including tilted focusing amplified wavefronts generation coherent amplification terahertz traveling waves terahertz phased-array generation also demonstrated
