antarctic role northern hemisphere glaciation
earths climate underwent major transition warmth late pliocene global surface temperatures similar degrees degrees c higher today extensive northern hemisphere glaciation nhg similar million years ago ma show north pacific deep waters substantially colder degrees c probably fresher north atlantic deep water intensification nhg similar ma atlantic-pacific temperature gradient reduced < degrees c suggesting initiation stronger heat transfer north atlantic deep pacific posit increased glaciation antarctica deduced +/ meter sea-level fall ma development strong polar halocline fundamentally altered deep ocean circulation enhanced interhemispheric heat salt transport thereby contributing nhg
