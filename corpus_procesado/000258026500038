switching fear distinct neuronal circuits
switching exploratory defensive behaviour fundamental survival many animals transition achieved specific neuronal circuits known using converse behavioural states fear extinction context dependent renewal model mice show bi directional transitions states high low fear triggered rapid switch balance activity two distinct populations basal amygdala neurons two populations integrated discrete neuronal circuits differentially connected hippocampus medial prefrontal cortex targeted reversible neuronal inactivation basal amygdala prevents behavioural changes without affecting memory expression behaviour findings indicate switching distinct behavioural states can triggered selective activation specific neuronal circuits integrating sensory contextual information observations provide new framework understanding context dependent changes fear behaviour
