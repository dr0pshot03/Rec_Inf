direct observation abrupt insulator-to-metal transition dense liquid deuterium 
eighty years ago proposed solid hydrogen becomemetallic sufficiently high density despite numerous investigations transition yet experimentally observed recently much interest analog predicted metallic transition dense liquid due relevance planetary science show direct observation abrupt insulator-to-metal transition dense liquid deuterium experimental determination location transition provides much-needed benchmark theory may constrain region hydrogen-helium immiscibility boundary-layer pressure standard models internal structure gas-giant planets
