reduction theta rhythm dissociates grid cell spatial periodicity directional tuning
grid cells recorded medial entorhinal cortex freely moving rats exhibit firing regular spatial locations temporal modulation theta rhythm oscillations hertz analyzed grid cell spatial coding reduction network theta rhythm oscillations caused medial septum ms inactivation muscimol ms inactivation grid cells lost spatial periodicity whereas head-direction cells maintained selectivity conjunctive grid-by-head-direction cells lost grid cell spatial periodicity retained head-direction specificity cells showed reduced rhythmicity autocorrelations cross-correlations supports hypothesis spatial coding grid cells requires theta oscillations dissociates mechanisms underlying generation entorhinal grid cell periodicity head-direction selectivity
