observation efimov state helium trimer
quantum theory dictates upon weakening two-body interaction three-body system infinite number three-body bound states huge spatial extent emerge just three-body states become unbound three helium atoms predicted form molecular system manifests peculiarity natural conditions without artificial tuning attraction particles external field report experimental observation long-predicted experimentally elusive efimov state he- means coulomb explosion imaging show spatial images efimov state confirming predicted size typical structure two atoms close third far away
