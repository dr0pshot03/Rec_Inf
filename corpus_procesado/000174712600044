self-assembly phase-segregated liquid crystal structures 
additional functionality can incorporated liquid crystalline materials using phase segregation self-assembly intermolecular interactions hydrogen bonding ionic interactions play key roles formation complex structures one- two- three-dimensional phase-segregated structures various scales length formed self-assembty variety partially incompatible molecules structures can enhance anisotropic properties ionic conductivity
