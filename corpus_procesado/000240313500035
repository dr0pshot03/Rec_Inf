chemically induced fast solid-state transitions omega-vopo4 vanadium phosphate catalysts
vanadium phosphates important catalysts oxidation alkanes commercial catalysts comprise complex range v4+ v5+ phosphates used three complementary situ characterization methodologies-powder x-ray diffraction laser raman electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopies-to show metastable phase omega-vopo4 sensitive many reactants products butane oxidation rapid transformation omega-vopo4 delta-vopo4 occurs exposure butane reaction temperature hence metastable omega-vopo4 may play role formation commercial catalysts
