biological system often efficient takes advantage regularities environment12 like terrestrial creatures spatial sense relies regularities associated ground surface2- simple important ecological fact field view ground surface extends upwards near feet infinity horizon2 forms basis trigonometric relationship wherein object ground higher field view looks object infinity seen horizon provide support hypothesis visual system uses angular declination horizon distance judgement using visually directed action task7- found angular declination increased binocularly viewing base-up prisms observer underestimated distance adapting prisms however observer overestimated distance prism removal significantly show distance overestimation after-effect prism adaptation due lowered perceived eye level reduced objects angular declination horizon
