ampk regulates circadian clock cryptochrome phosphorylation degradation 
circadian clocks coordinate behavioral physiological processes daily light-dark cycles driving rhythmic transcription thousands genes whereas master clock brain set light pacemakers peripheral organs liver reset food availability although setting "entrainment" mechanisms remain mysterious studying mouse fibroblasts demonstrated nutrient-responsive adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase ampk phosphorylates destabilizes clock component cryptochrome cry1 mouse livers ampk activity nuclear localization rhythmic inversely correlated cry1 nuclear protein abundance stimulation ampk destabilized cryptochromes altered circadian rhythms mice ampk pathway genetically disrupted showed alterations peripheral clocks thus phosphorylation ampk enables cryptochrome transduce nutrient signals circadian clocks mammalian peripheral organs
