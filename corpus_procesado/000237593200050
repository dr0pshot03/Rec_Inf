platensimycin selective fabf inhibitor potent antibiotic properties
bacterial infection remains serious threat human lives emerging resistance existing antibiotics although scientific community avidly pursued discovery new antibiotics interact new targets efforts met limited success since early 1960s report discovery platensimycin previously unknown class antibiotics produced streptomyces platensis platensimycin demonstrates strong broad-spectrum gram-positive antibacterial activity selectively inhibiting cellular lipid biosynthesis show anti-bacterial effect exerted selective targeting beta-ketoacyl-acyl-carrier-proteinacp synthase i/ii fabf/b synthetic pathway fatty acids direct binding assays show platensimycin interacts specifically acyl-enzyme intermediate target protein x-ray crystallographic studies reveal specific conformational change occurs acylation must take place inhibitor can bind treatment platensimycin eradicates staphylococcus aureus infection mice unique mode action platensimycin shows cross-resistance key antibiotic-resistant strains tested including methicillin-resistant s aureus vancomycin-intermediate s aureus vancomycin-resistant enterococci platensimycin potent inhibitor reported fabf/ b condensing enzymes inhibitor targets shows broad-spectrum activity vivo efficacy observed toxicity
