human appropriation photosynthesis products
previous global estimates human impact terrestrial photosynthesis products depended heavily extrapolation plot-scale measurements estimated impact use recent data many collected global continental scales monte carlo techniques incorporate known estimated error parameters provided estimates uncertainty estimate humans appropriate % terrestrial photosynthesis products broad range reflects uncertainty key parameters makes difficult ascertain whether approaching crisis levels use planets resources improved estimates will require high-resolution global measures within agricultural lands tropical forests
