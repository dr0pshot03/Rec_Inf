oxytocin/vasopressin-related peptides ancient role reproductive behavior 
many biological functions conserved extent conservation applies integrative behaviors unknown vasopressin oxytocin neuropeptides strongly implicated mammalian reproductive social behaviors yet rodent loss-of-function mutants relatively subtle behavioral defects identify oxytocin/vasopressin-like signaling system caenorhabditis elegans consisting peptide two receptors expressed sexually dimorphic patterns males lacking peptide receptors perform poorly reproductive behaviors including mate search mate recognition mating sensorimotor behaviors intact quantitative analysis indicates mating motor patterns fragmented inefficient mutants suggesting oxytocin/vasopressin peptides increase coherence mating behaviors results indicate conserved molecules coordinate diverse behavioral motifs reproductive behavior
