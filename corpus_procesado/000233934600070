zebrafish dorsal axis apparent four-cell stage 
central question development multicellular organisms pertains timing mechanisms specification embryonic axes many organisms specification dorsoventral axis requires signalling proteins transforming growth factor-beta wnt families- show maternal transcripts zebrafish nodal-related morphogen squint sqt can localize two blastomeres four-cell stage predict dorsal axis removal cells containing sqt transcripts four-to-eight-cell embryos injection antisense morpholino oligonucleotides targeting sqt oocytes can cause loss dorsal structures localization sqt transcripts independent maternal wnt pathway function requires highly conserved sequence untranslated region thus dorsoventral axis apparent early cleavage stages may require maternally encoded morphogen sqt associated factors untranslated region human nodal gene can also localize exogenous sequences dorsal cells mechanism may evolutionarily conserved
