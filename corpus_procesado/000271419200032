combinatorial binding predicts spatio-temporal cis-regulatory activity 
development requires establishment precise patterns gene expression primarily controlled transcription factors binding cis-regulatory modules although transcription factor occupancy can now identified genome-wide scales decoding regulatory landscape remains daunting challenge used novel approach predict spatio-temporal cis-regulatory activity based vivo transcription factor binding enhancer activity data generated high-resolution atlas cis-regulatory modules describing temporal combinatorial occupancy drosophila mesoderm development binding profiles cis-regulatory modules characterized expression used train support vector machines predict five spatio-temporal expression patterns vivo transgenic reporter assays demonstrate high accuracy predictions reveal unanticipated plasticity transcription factor binding leading similar expression data-driven approach require previous knowledge transcription factor sequence affinity function expression making widely applicable
