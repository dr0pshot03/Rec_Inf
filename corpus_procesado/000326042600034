mucus enhances gut homeostasis oral tolerance delivering immunoregulatory signals 
dense mucus layer large intestine prevents inflammation shielding underlying epithelium luminal bacteria food antigens mucus barrier organized around hyperglycosylated mucin muc2 show small intestine porous mucus layer permitted uptake muc2 antigen-sampling dendritic cells dcs glycans associated muc2 imprinted dcs anti-inflammatory properties assembling galectin--dectin--fc gamma riib receptor complex activated beta-catenin transcription factor interfered dc expression inflammatory tolerogenic cytokines inhibiting gene transcription nuclear factor kappa b muc2 induced additional conditioning signals intestinal epithelial cells thus mucus merely form nonspecific physical barrier also constrains immunogenicity gut antigens delivering tolerogenic signals
