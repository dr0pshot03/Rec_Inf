observation small gullies associated recent surface runoff mars renewed question liquid water stability surface mars gullies formed groundwater seepage underground aquifers however observations gullies originating isolated peaks dune crests question scenario show landforms may result melting water ice top meters martian subsurface high obliquity conclusions based analogy martian gullies terrestrial debris flows observed greenland numerical simulations show above-freezing temperatures can occur high obliquities near surface mars temperatures predicted latitudes slope orientations corresponding gullies observed mars
