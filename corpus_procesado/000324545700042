recent global-warming hiatus tied equatorial pacific surface cooling
despite continued increase atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations annual-mean global temperature risen twenty-first century challenging prevailing view anthropogenic forcing causes climate warming various mechanisms proposed hiatus global warming- relative importance quantified hampering observational estimates climate sensitivity show accounting recent cooling eastern equatorial pacific reconciles climate simulations observations present novel method uncovering mechanisms global temperature change prescribing addition radiative forcing observed history sea surface temperature central eastern tropical pacific climate model although surface temperature prescription limited % global surface model reproduces annual-mean global temperature remarkably well correlation coefficient r includes current hiatus period accelerated global warming moreover simulation captures major seasonal regional characteristics hiatus including intensified walker circulation winter cooling northwestern north america prolonged drought southern usa results show current hiatus part natural climate variability tied specifically la-nina-like decadal cooling although similar decadal hiatus events may occur future multi-decadal warming trend likely continue greenhouse gas increase
