sedimentary structure linear sand dunes 
linear sand dunes-dunes extend parallel rather star-like crescentic forms-are abundant type desert sand dune development internal structure poorly understood rarely recognized rock record models linear dune development- able take account sub-surface structure existing dunes relied instead either extrapolation short-term measurements winds sediment transport observations near-surface internal sedimentary structures studies clear linear dunes can migrate laterally present images produced ground penetrating radar showing three-dimensional sedimentary structure linear dune namib sand sea worlds largest linear dunes situated profiles show clear evidence lateral migration linear dune moreover migration sinuous crest-line along dune produces divergent sets cross-stratification can become stacked dune height increases large linear dunes can support superimposed dunes produce stacked sets trough cross-stratification clear structural signatures linear dunes facilitate recognition geological records
