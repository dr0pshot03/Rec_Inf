synergic sedation sensitive anions: alkali-mediated zincation cyclic ethers ethene 
deprotonation alkyl vinyl carbon-hydrogen bonds synthetic purposes often hindered merely need exceptionally strong base inherent instability resultant anion metalation cyclic ethers adjacent oxygen example invariably initiated ring-opening decomposition pathway show use bimetallic base can overcome instability cooperative combination zinc-carbon sodium-oxygen bonding tetrahydrofuran tetrahydropyran reacted cleanly days room temperature yield alpha-zinc-substituted products sufficiently stable isolated crystallographically characterized related zincation-anion trapping strategy sodium replaced potassium induced clean deprotonation ethene yield stable product preliminary electrophilic quenching experiments alpha-zinc-substituted cyclic ethers benzoyl chloride gave satisfactory yields tetrahydrofuran-derived ketone trace amounts tetrahydropyran-derived ketone
