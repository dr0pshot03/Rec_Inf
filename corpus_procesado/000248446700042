morphological evolution multiple cis-regulatory mutations single 
one central yet unsolved question evolutionary biology relationship genetic variants segregating within species causes morphological differences species classic neo-darwinian view postulates species differences result accumulation small-effect changes multiple loci however many examples support possible role larger abrupt changes expression developmental genes morphological evolution1- although evidence might considered challenge neo-darwinian micromutationist view evolution currently examples actual genes causing morphological differences species4- examine genetic basis trichome pattern difference drosophila species previously shown result evolution single gene shavenbaby svb probably cis-regulatory changes6 first identified three distinct svb enhancers d melanogaster driving reporter gene expression partly overlapping patterns together recapitulate endogenous svb expression three homologous enhancers d sechellia drive expression modified patterns direction consistent evolved svb expression pattern test influence enhancers actual phenotypic difference conducted interspecific genetic mapping resolution sufficient recover multiple intragenic recombinants functional analysis revealed independent genetic regions upstream svb overlap three identified enhancers collectively required generate d sechellia trichome pattern results demonstrate accumulation multiple small-effect changes single locus underlies evolution morphological difference species data support view alleles large effect distinguish species may sometimes reflect accumulation multiple mutations small effect select genes
