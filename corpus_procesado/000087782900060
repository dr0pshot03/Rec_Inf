role guanosine triphosphatase rac2 t helper cell differentiation 
t helper th cells mediate cellular immunity whereas th cells potentiate antiparasite humoral immunity used complementary dna subtraction method representational display analysis show small guanosine triphosphatase rac2 expressed selectively murine th cells rac induces interferon-gamma ifn-gamma promoter cooperative activation nuclear factor kappa b p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways tetracycline-regulated transgenic mice expressing constitutively active rac2 t cells exhibited enhanced ifn-gamma production dominant-negative pac inhibited ifn-gamma production murine t cells moreover t cells rac2-/- mice showed decreased ifn-gamma production th conditions vitro thus rac2 activates th-specific signaling ifn-gamma gene expression
