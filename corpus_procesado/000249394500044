production molecular positronium 
known many years electron antiparticle positron may together form metastable hydrogen-like atom known positronium ps ref wheeler speculated two ps atoms may combine form dipositronium molecule ps binding energy ev recently molecule studied theoretically however ps short lifetime difficult obtain low-energy positrons large numbers ps previously observed unambiguously show intense positron bursts implanted thin film porous silica ps created internal pore surfaces found molecule formation occurs much efficiently competing process spin exchange quenching appears suppressed confined pore geometry result experimentally confirms existence ps molecule paves way multi-positronium work using similar techniques intense positron source expect increase ps density point many thousands atoms interact can undergo phase transition form bose-einstein condensate purely leptonic macroscopic quantum matter-antimatter system interest right also represent milestone path produce annihilation gamma-ray laser
