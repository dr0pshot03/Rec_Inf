resolution lung inflammation cd44
successful repair tissue injury inflammation requires resolution inflammatory response removal extracellular matrix breakdown products examined whether cell-surface adhesion molecule hyaluronan receptor cd44 plays role resolving lung inflammation cd44-deficient mice succumb unremitting inflammation following noninfectious lung injury characterized impaired clearance apoptotic neutrophils persistent accumulation hyaluronan fragments site tissue injury impaired activation transforming growth factor-beta phenotype partially reversed reconstitution cd44+ cells thus demonstrating critical role receptor resolving lung inflammation
