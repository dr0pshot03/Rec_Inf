control exciton fluxes excitonic integrated circuit
efficient signal communication uses photons signal processing however uses optically inactive medium electrons therefore interconnection electronic signal processing optical communication required integrated circuit level demonstrated control exciton fluxes excitonic integrated circuit circuit consists three exciton optoelectronic transistors performs operations exciton fluxes directional switching merging photons transform excitons circuit input excitons transform photons circuit output exciton flux input output controlled pattern electrode voltages direct coupling photons used communication excitons used device operation medium may lead development efficient exciton based optoelectronic devices
