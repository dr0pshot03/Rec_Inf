coordination rho gtpase activities cell protrusion 
gtpases rac1 rhoa cdc42 act together control cytoskeleton dynamics- recent biosensor studies shown three gtpases activated front migrating cells- biochemical evidence suggests may regulate one another: cdc42 can activate rac1 ref rac1 rhoa mutually inhibitory- however spatiotemporal coordination seconds single-micrometre dimensions typical individual protrusion events remains unknown examine gtpase coordination mouse embryonic fibroblasts simultaneous visualization two gtpase biosensors using computational multiplexing approach capable defining relationships multiple protein activities visualized separate experiments found rhoa activated cell edge synchronous edge advancement whereas cdc42 rac1 activated mm behind edge delay 40s indicates rac1 rhoa operate antagonistically spatial separation precise timing rhoa role initial events protrusion whereas rac1 cdc42 activate pathways implicated reinforcement stabilization newly expanded protrusions
