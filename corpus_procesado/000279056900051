activity-dependent relocation axon initial segment fine-tunes neuronal excitability 
neurons axon initial segment ais specialized region near start axon site action potential initiation- precise location ais varies across within different neuronal types linked cells information-processing capabilities however factors determining ais position individual neurons remain unknown show changes electrical activity can alter location ais dissociated hippocampal cultures chronic depolarization high extracellular potassium moves multiple components ais including voltage-gated sodium channels mu m away soma excitatory neurons movement reverses neurons returned non-depolarized conditions depends activation t and/or l-type voltage-gated calcium channels ais also moved distally combined long-term led light-emitting diode photostimulation sparse neuronal expression light-activated cation channel channelrhodopsin- burst patterning activity successful regular stimulation frequency failed furthermore changes ais position correlate alterations current thresholds action potential spiking results show neurons can regulate position entire subcellular structure according ongoing levels patterns electrical activity novel form activity-dependent plasticity may fine-tune neuronal excitability development
