endogenous protein s-nitrosylation e coli: regulation oxyr
endogenous s-nitrosylation proteins principal mechanism cellular signaling eukaryotes observed microbes report protein s-nitrosylation obligate concomitant anaerobic respiration nitrate escherichia coli endogenous s-nitrosylation anaerobic respiration controlled transcription factor oxyr previously thought operate aerobic conditions deletion oxyr resulted large increases protein s-nitrosylation s-nitrosylation oxyr induced transcription regulon distinct regulon induced oxyr oxidation furthermore products unique anaerobic regulon protected s-nitrosothiols anaerobic growth e coli lacking oxyr impaired nitrate thus oxyr serves master regulator s-nitrosylation alternative posttranslational modifications oxyr control distinct transcriptional responses
