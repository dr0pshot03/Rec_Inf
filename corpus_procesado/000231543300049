circadian clock control sumoylation bmal1 
molecular machinery governs circadian rhythmicity based clock proteins organized regulatory feedback loops although posttranstational modification clock proteins likely finely control circadian functions limited information available date show bmal1 essential transcription factor component of-the clock mechanism sumoylated highly conserved lysine residue lys vivo bmal1 shows circadian pattern sumoylation parallels activation mouse liver sumoylation bmal1 requires induced clock heterodimerization partner bmal1 ectopic expression sumo-deficient bmal1 demonstrates sumoylation plays important role bmal1 circadian expression clock rhythmicity reveals additional level regulation within core mechanism circadian clock
