shmt2 drives glioma cell survival ischaemia imposes dependence glycine clearance 
cancer cells adapt metabolic processes support rapid proliferation less known cancer cells alter metabolism promote cell survival poorly vascularized tumour microenvironment1- identify key role serine glycine metabolism survival brain cancer cells within ischaemic zones gliomas inhuman glioblastoma multiforme mitochondrial serine hydroxymethyltransferase shmt2 glycine decarboxylase gldc highly expressed pseudopalisading cells surround necrotic foci find shmt2 activity limits pyruvate kinase pkm2 reduces oxygen consumption eliciting metabolic state confers profound survival advantage cells poorly vascularized tumour regions gldc inhibition impairs cells high shmt2 levels excess glycine metabolized gldc can converted toxic molecules aminoacetone methylglyoxal thus shmt2 required cancer cells adapt tumour environment also renders cells sensitive glycine cleavage system inhibition
