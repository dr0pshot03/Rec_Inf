villification: gut gets villi 
villi human chick gut formed similar stepwise progressions wherein mesenchyme attached epithelium first fold longitudinal ridges zigzag pattern lastly individual villi find steps villification depend sequential differentiation distinct smooth muscle layers gut restrict expansion growing endoderm mesenchyme generating compressive stresses lead buckling folding quantitative computational model incorporating measured properties developing gut recapitulates morphological patterns seen villification variety species results provide mechanistic understanding formation elaborations lining gut essential providing sufficient surface area nutrient absorption
