cavity cooling single atom
conventional methods laser-cool atoms rely repeated cycles optical pumping spontaneous emission photon atom spontaneous emission random direction provides dissipative mechanism required remove entropy atom however alternative cooling methods proposed single atom strongly coupled high-finesse cavity role spontaneous emission replaced escape photon cavity application cooling schemes improve performance atom-cavity systems quantum information processing furthermore cavity cooling rely spontaneous emission can applied systems laser-cooled conventional methods include molecules closed transition collective excitations bose condensates destroyed randomly directed recoil kicks demonstrate cavity cooling single rubidium atoms stored intracavity dipole trap cooling mechanism results extended storage times improved localization atoms estimate observed cooling rate least five times larger produced free-space cooling methods comparable excitation atom
