global cooling eruption mount pinatubo: test climate feedback water vapor
sensitivity earths climate external radiative forcing depends critically response water vapor use global cooling drying atmosphere observed eruption mount pinatubo test model predictions climate feedback water vapor first highlight success model reproducing observed drying volcanic eruption comparing model simulations without water vapor feedback demonstrate importance atmospheric drying amplifying temperature change show without strong positive feedback water vapor model unable reproduce observed cooling results provide quantitative evidence reliability water vapor feedback current climate models crucial use global warming projections
