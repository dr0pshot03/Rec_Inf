intracellular parasite invasion strategies
intracellular parasites use various strategies invade cells subvert cellular signaling pathways thus gain foothold host defenses efficient cell entry ability exploit intracellular niches persistence make parasites treacherous pathogens intracellular parasites gain entry via host-mediated processes apicomplexans use system adhesion-based motility called gliding actively penetrate host cells actin polymerization dependent motility facilitates parasite migration across cellular barriers enables dissemination within tissues powers invasion host cells efficient invasion brought widespread success group includes toxoplasma plasmodium cryptosporidium
