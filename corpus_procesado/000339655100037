coherent imaging spectroscopy quantum many-body spin system
quantum simulators well-controlled quantum systems used reproduce dynamics less understood ones potential explore physics inaccessible modeling classical computers however checking results simulations also becomes classically intractable system sizes increase introduce implement coherent imaging spectroscopic technique akin magnetic resonance imaging validate quantum simulation use method determine energy levels interaction strengths fully connected quantum many-body system additionally directly measure critical energy gap near quantum phase transition expect general technique become verification tool quantum simulators experiments advance beyond proof-of-principle demonstrations exceed resources conventional computers
