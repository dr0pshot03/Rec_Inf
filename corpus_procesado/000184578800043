bottlenose dolphins perceive object features echolocation
organisms including people recognize distant objects fundamental question correspondence object characteristics distal stimuli like visual shape sensory characteristics proximal stimuli like retinal projection ambiguous view sensory systems designed pick ecologically useful information vague mechanisms might work echolocating dolphins studied models object recognition sonar systems correspondence echo characteristics object characteristics less clear many cognitive scientists assume object characteristics extracted proximal stimuli evidence remains ambiguous example dolphin may store sound templates brain identify whole objects listening particular sound alternatively dolphins brain may contain algorithms derived natural endowments experience allow identify object characteristics based sounds standard method used address question many species- indirect led equivocal results dolphins- outline appropriate method test show dolphins extract object characteristics directly echoes
