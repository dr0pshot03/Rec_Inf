fusion pore dynamics insulin granule exocytosis pancreatic islet
insulin secretion intact mouse pancreatic islets investigated two-photon excitation imaging insulin granule exocytosis occurred mainly toward interstitial space away blood vessels fusion pore unusually stable lifetime seconds opening -nanometer-diameter pore preceded unrestricted lateral diffusion lipids along inner wall pore supporting idea structure composed membrane lipids pore dilated nanometers granules rapidly flattened discharged contents thus methodology reveals fusion pore dynamics intact tissues nanometer resolution
