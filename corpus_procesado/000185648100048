role visual pigment properties rod cone phototransduction 
retinal rods cones share phototransduction pathway involving cyclic gmp1 cones typically times less photosensitive rods response kinetics several times faster2but underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown almost proteins involved phototransduction distinct rod cone variants differences properties rod cone pigments described -fold shorter lifetime meta-ii state active conformation cone pigment3- higher rate spontaneous isomerization78 contributions functional differences rods cones remain speculative addressed question expressing human salamander red cone pigment xenopus rods human rod pigment xenopus cones show rod cone pigments present cell produce light responses identical amplification kinetics thereby ruling difference signalling properties however red cone pigment isomerizes spontaneously times frequently rod pigment high spontaneous activity adapts native cones even darkness making less sensitive kinetically faster rods nevertheless additional factors probably involved differences
