impacts biodiversity emergence transmission infectious diseases 
current unprecedented declines biodiversity reduce ability ecological communities provide many fundamental ecosystem services evaluate evidence reduced biodiversity affects transmission infectious diseases humans animals plants principle loss biodiversity either increase decrease disease transmission however mounting evidence indicates biodiversity loss frequently increases disease transmission contrast areas naturally high biodiversity may serve source pool new pathogens overall despite many remaining questions current evidence indicates preserving intact ecosystems endemic biodiversity generally reduce prevalence infectious diseases
