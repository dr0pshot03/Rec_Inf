magnetic reconnection near venusian magnetotail 
observations venus express magnetometer low-energy particle detector revealed magnetic field plasma behavior near-venus wake symptomatic magnetic reconnection process occurs earths magnetotail expected magnetotail nonmagnetized planet venus may plasma flow region toward planet magnetic field component transverse flow reversed magnetic reconnection plasma process changes topology magnetic field results energy exchange magnetic field plasma thus energetics venus magnetotail resembles terrestrial tail energy stored later released magnetic field plasma
