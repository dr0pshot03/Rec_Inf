controlling velocity light pulses
now possible exercise high degree control velocity light pulses pass material media velocity known group velocity can made different speed light vacuum c specifically group velocity light can made much smaller c greater c even negative present survey methods establishing extreme values group velocity concentrating especially methods work room-temperature solids also describe applications slow light
