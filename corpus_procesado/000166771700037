functional nanoscale electronic devices assembled using silicon nanowire building blocks 
semiconductor nanowires can transport electrons holes function building blocks nanoscale electronics assembled without need complex costly fabrication facilities boron phosphorous-doped silicon nanowires used building blocks assemble three types semiconductor nanodevices passive diode structures consisting crossed p n-type nanowires exhibit rectifying transport similar planar p-n junctions active bipolar transistors consisting heavily lightly n-doped nanowires crossing common p-type wire base exhibit common base emitter current gains large respectively addition p n-type nanowires used assemble complementary inverter-like structures facile assembly key electronic device elements well-defined nanoscale building blocks may represent step toward bottom-up paradigm electronics manufacturing
