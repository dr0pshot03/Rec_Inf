prokaryotic origin actin cytoskeleton 
thought recently bacteria lack actin tubulin filament networks organize eukaryotic cytoplasm however show bacterial mreb protein assembles filaments subunit repeat similar f-actin-the physiological polymer eukaryotic actin elucidating mreb crystal structure demonstrate mreb actin similar three dimensions moreover crystals contain protofilaments allowing visualization actin-like strands atomic resolution structure mreb protofilament remarkably good agreement model f-actin showing proteins assemble identical orientations actin-like properties mreb explain finding mreb forms large fibrous spirals cell membrane rod-shaped cells involved cell-shape determination thus prokaryotes now known possess homologues tubulin namely ftsz actin
