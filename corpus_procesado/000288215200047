aging natural world: comparative data reveal similar mortality patterns across primates 
human senescence patterns-late onset mortality increase slow mortality acceleration exceptional longevity-are often described unique animal world using individual-based data set longitudinal studies wild populations seven primate species show contrary assumptions human uniqueness human senescence falls within primate continuum aging; tendency males shorter life spans higher age-specific mortality females throughout much adulthood common feature many primates; aging profiles primate species reflect phylogenetic position findings suggest mortality patterns primates shaped local selective forces rather phylogenetic history
