wild-type microglia arrest pathology mouse model rett syndrome 
rett syndrome x-linked autism spectrum disorder disease characterized inmost cases mutation mecp2 gene encodes methyl-cpg-binding protein- although mecp2 expressed many tissues disease generally attributed primary neuronal dysfunction however shown recently glia specifically astrocytes also contribute rett pathophysiology examine role another form glia microglia murine model rett syndrome transplantation wild-type bone marrow irradiation-conditioned mecp2-null hosts resulted engraftment brain parenchyma bone-marrow-derived myeloid cells microglial phenotype arrest disease development however cranial irradiation blocked lead shield microglial engraftment prevented disease arrested similarly targeted expression mecp2 myeloid cells driven lysmcre mecp2-null background markedly attenuated disease symptoms thus multiple approaches wild-type mecp2-expressing microglia within context mecp2-null male mouse arrested numerous facets disease pathology: lifespan increased breathing patterns normalized apnoeas reduced body weight increased near wild type locomotor activity improved mecp2+/- females also showed significant improvements result wild-type microglial engraftment benefits mediated wild-type microglia however diminished phagocytic activity inhibited pharmacologically using annexin v block phosphatydilserine residues apoptotic targets thus preventing recognition engulfment tissue-resident phagocytes results suggest importance microglial phagocytic activity rett syndrome data implicate microglia major players pathophysiology devastating disorder suggest bone marrow transplantation might offer feasible therapeutic approach
