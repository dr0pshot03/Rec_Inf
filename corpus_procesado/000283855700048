evolution yeast noncoding rnas reveals alternative mechanism widespread intron loss 
evolutionary forces responsible intron loss unresolved whereas research focused protein-coding genes analyze noncoding small nucleolar rna snorna genes introns rather exons typically functional elements within yeast lineage exemplified human pathogen candida albicans find-through deep rna sequencing genome-wide annotation splice junctions-extreme compaction loss associated exons retention snornas within introns saccharomyces yeast lineage however find introns lost widespread degeneration splicing signals intron loss perhaps facilitated innovations snorna processing distinct observed protein-coding genes respect mechanism evolutionary timing
