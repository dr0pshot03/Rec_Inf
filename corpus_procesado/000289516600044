interplay changing climate species ecology drives macroevolutionary dynamics
ecological change provokes speciation extinction knowledge interplay among biotic abiotic drivers macroevolution remains limited using unparalleled fossil record cenozoic macroperforate planktonic foraminifera demonstrate macroevolutionary dynamics depend interaction species ecology changing climate interplay drives diversification differs speciation probability extinction risk: speciation strongly shaped diversity dependence climate change whereas reverse true extinction crucially single ecology optimal environments species distinct ecologies significantly different probabilities speciation extinction ensuing macroevolutionary dynamics depend fundamentally ecological structure species assemblages
