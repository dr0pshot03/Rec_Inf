suppression neuroinflammation astrocytic dopamine d2 receptors via alpha b-crystallin 
chronic neuroinflammation common feature ageing brain neurodegenerative disorders however molecular cellular mechanisms underlying regulation innate immunity central nervous system remain elusive show astrocytic dopamine d2 receptor drd2 modulates innate immunity alpha b-crystallin cryab known suppress neuroinflammation12 demonstrate knockout mice lacking drd2 showed remarkable inflammatory response multiple central nervous system regions increased vulnerability nigral dopaminergic neurons neurotoxin -methyl--phenyl--tetrahydropyridine mptp-induced neurotoxicity3 astrocytes null drd2 became hyper-responsive immune stimuli marked reduction level cryab preferential ablation drd2 astrocytes robustly activated astrocytes substantia nigra gain loss-of-function studies showed cryab critical drd2-mediated modulation innate immune response astrocytes furthermore treatment wildtype mice selective drd2 agonist quinpirole increased resistance nigral dopaminergic neurons mptp partial suppression inflammation study indicates astrocytic drd2 activation normally suppresses neuroinflammation central nervous system cryab-dependent mechanism provides new strategy targeting astrocyte-mediated innate immune response central nervous system ageing disease
