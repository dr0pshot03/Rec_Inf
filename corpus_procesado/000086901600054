silberblick/wnt11 mediates convergent extension movements zebrafish gastrulation
vertebrate gastrulation involves specification coordinated movement large populations cells give rise ectodermal mesodermal endodermal germ layers although many genes involved specification cell identity process identified little known genes coordinate cell movement show zebrafish silberblick slb locus encodes wnt11 slb/wnt11 activity required cells undergo correct convergent extension movements gastrulation absence slb/wnt11 function abnormal extension axial tissue results cyclopia midline defects head requirement slb/wnt11 cell non-autonomous results indicate correct extension axial tissue least partly dependent medio-lateral cell intercalation paraxial tissue also show slb phenotype rescued truncated form dishevelled signal canonical wnt pathway suggesting flies wnt signalling might mediate morphogenetic events divergent signal transduction cascade results provide genetic experimental evidence wnt activity lateral tissues crucial role driving convergent extension movements underlying vertebrate gastrulation
