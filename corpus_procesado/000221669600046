high pore fluid pressure may cause silent slip nankai trough
silent-slip events detected several subduction zones cause events unknown using seismic imaging detected cause tokai silent slip occurred presumed fault zone great earthquake seismic image obtained shows zone high pore fluid pressure subducted oceanic crust located down-dip subducted ridge propose structures effectively extend region conditionally stable slips consequently generate silent slip
