regulation cell migration c2 domain tumor suppressor pten
pten tumor suppressor protein dephosphorylates phosphatidylinositol trisphosphate antagonizes phosphatidylinositol kinase signaling pathway show pten can also inhibit cell migration c2 domain independent lipid phosphatase activity activity depends protein phosphatase activity pten dephosphorylation single residue threonine ability pten control cell migration c2 domain likely important feature tumor suppressor activity
