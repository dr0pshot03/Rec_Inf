control visual cortical signals prefrontal dopamine 
prefrontal cortex thought modulate sensory signals posterior cortices top-down attention little known underlying neural circuitry experimental clinical evidence indicate prefrontal dopamine important role cognitive functions acting predominantly d1 receptors show dopamine d1 receptors mediate prefrontal control signals visual cortex macaques macaca mulatta pharmacologically altered d1-receptor-mediated activity frontal eye field prefrontal cortex measured effect responses neurons area v4 visual cortex manipulation sufficient enhance magnitude orientation selectivity reliability v4 visual responses extent comparable known effects top-down attention enhancement v4 signals restricted neurons response fields overlapping part visual space affected d1 receptor manipulation altering either d1 d2-receptor-mediated frontal eye field activity increased saccadic target selection d2 receptor manipulation enhance v4 signals results identify role d1 receptors mediating control visual cortical signals prefrontal cortex suggest processing sensory areas altered mental disorders involving prefrontal dopamine
