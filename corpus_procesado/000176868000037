atomistic mechanisms governing elastic limit incipient plasticity crystals
nanometre-scale contact experiments- simulations- demonstrate potential probe incipient plasticity-the onset permanent deformation-in crystals studies also point need understanding mechanisms governing defect nucleation broad range fields applications present fundamental framework describing incipient plasticity combines results atomistic finite-element modelling theoretical concepts structural stability finite strain experimental analysis quantify two key features nucleation subsequent evolution defects position-sensitive criterion based elastic stability determines location character homogeneously nucleated defects validate stability criterion atomistic continuum levels propose detailed interpretation experimentally observed sequence displacement bursts elucidate role secondary defect sources operating locally stress levels considerably smaller ideal strength required homogeneous nucleation findings provide self-consistent explanation discontinuous elastic-plastic response nanoindentation measurements guide fundamental studies across many disciplines seek quantify predict initiation early stages plasticity
