icos critical cd40-mediated antibody class switching 
inducible co-stimulatory molecule icos cd28 homologue implicated regulating t-cell differentiation- co-stimulatory signals critical regulating t-cell activation understanding co-stimulatory signals may enable design rational therapies immune-mediated diseases according two-signal model t-cell activation t cells require antigen-specific signal second co-stimulatory signal optimal t-cell activation co-stimulatory signal promotes t-cell proliferation lymphokine secretion effector function b7-cd28 pathway provides essential signals t-cell activation account co-stimulation generated mice lacking icos icos-/- determine essential functions icos report icos-/ mice exhibit profound deficits immunoglobulin isotype class switching accompanied impaired germinal centre formation class switching restored icos-/ mice cd40 stimulation showing icos promotes t-cell/b-cell collaboration cd40/cd40l pathway
