perceiving distance accurately directional process integrating ground information
absolute distance object accurately judged beyond m refs yet viewed reference flat terrain humans accurately judge absolute distance object m ability important various actions- provide evidence accomplished integrating local patches ground information global surface reference frame first show restricting observers visual field view local ground area around target leads distance underestimation indicating relatively wide expanse ground surface required accurate distance judgement second proof surface integration show even restricted view observer can accurately judge absolute distance scanning local patches ground surface bit bit near far reverse direction finding also reveals surface integration process uses near-ground-surface information foundation surface representation extrapolation far ground surface around target accurate absolute distance computation
