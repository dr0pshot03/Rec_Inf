multiple phases chondrocyte enlargement underlie differences skeletal proportions 
wide diversity skeletal proportions mammals evident upon survey natural history museums collections allows us distinguish species even reduced calcified components similarly individual comprised variety bones differing lengths largest contribution lengthening skeletal element differential elongation elements comes dramatic increase volume hypertrophic chondrocytes growth plate undergo terminal differentiation- however mechanisms chondrocyte volume enlargement remained mystery- use quantitative phase microscopy show mammalian chondrocytes undergo three distinct phases volume increase including phase massive cell swelling cellular dry mass significantly diluted light tight fluid regulatory mechanisms known control volume many cell types remarkable mechanism increasing cell size regulating growth rate however duration final phase volume enlargement proportional dry mass increase low density varies rapidly slowly elongating growth plates moreover find third phase locally regulated mechanism dependent insulin-like growth factor study provides framework understanding skeletal size regulated exploring cells sense modify establish volume set point
