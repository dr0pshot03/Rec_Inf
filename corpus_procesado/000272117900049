transcriptome complexity genome-reduced bacterium 
study basic principles transcriptome organization bacteria analyzed one smallest self-replicating organisms mycoplasma pneumoniae combined strand-specific tiling arrays complemented transcriptome sequencing spotted arrays detected previously undescribed mostly noncoding transcripts antisense configuration known genes identified operons polycistronic; almost half latter show decaying expression staircase-like manner various conditions operons divided smaller transcriptional units resulting many alternative transcripts frequent antisense transcripts alternative transcripts multiple regulators per gene imply highly dynamic transcriptome similar eukaryotes previously thought
