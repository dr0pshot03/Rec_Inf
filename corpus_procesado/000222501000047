control light emission 3d photonic crystals 
three-dimensional 3d photonic crystals containing artificial point defects fabricated emit light optical communications wavelengths constructed stacking -micrometer-period gallium arsenide striped layers resulting 3d woodpile photonic crystal indium-gallium arsenide-phosphide quantum-well layers emitting wavelength micrometers incorporated center crystal samples nine stacked layers constructed artificial point-defect cavities different sizes formed light-emitting layer light emission suppressed photonic crystal regions whereas cavity modes successfully observed point defects size dependent
