understanding exploiting c-h bond activation 
selective transformation ubiquitous inert c-h bonds functional groups far-reaching practical implications ranging efficient strategies fine chemical synthesis replacement current petrochemical feedstocks less expensive readily available alkanes past twenty years seen many examples c-h bond activation transition-metal centres often remarkably mild conditions high selectivity although profitable practical applications yet developed understanding organometallic reactions occur inherent advantages limitations practical alkane conversion progressed considerably fact recent development promising catalytic systems highlights potential organometallic chemistry useful c-h bond activation strategies will ultimately allow us exploit earths alkane resources efficiently cleanly
