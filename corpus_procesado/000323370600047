cyclic gmp-amp synthase innate immune sensor hiv retroviruses
retroviruses including hiv can activate innate immune responses host sensors retroviruses largely unknown show hiv infection activates cyclic guanosine monophosphate-adenosine monophosphate cgamp synthase cgas produce cgamp binds activates adaptor protein sting induce type interferons cytokines inhibitors hiv reverse transcriptase integrase abrogated interferon-beta induction virus suggesting reverse-transcribed hiv dna triggers innate immune response knockout knockdown cgas mouse human cell lines blocked cytokine induction hiv murine leukemia virus simian immunodeficiency virus results indicate cgas innate immune sensor hiv retroviruses
