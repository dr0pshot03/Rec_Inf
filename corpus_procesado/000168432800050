translational repression determines neuronal potential drosophila asymmetric cell division
asymmetric cell division fundamental strategy generating cellular diversity animal development daughter cells manifest asymmetry differential gene expression transcriptional regulation process focus many studies whereas cell-type-specific translational regulation considered minor role sensory organ development drosophila notch signalling directs asymmetry neuronal non-neuronal lineages zinc-finger transcriptional repressor tramtrack69 ttk69 acts downstream notch determinant non-neuronal identity show repression ttk69 protein expression neuronal lineage occurs translationally rather transcriptionally translational repression achieved direct interaction cis-acting sequences untranslated region ttk69 messenger rna trans-acting repressor rna-binding protein musashi msi although msi can act downstream notch notch signalling affect msi expression thus notch signalling likely regulate msi activity rather expression results define cell-type-specific translational control ttk69 msi downstream event notch signalling asymmetric cell division
