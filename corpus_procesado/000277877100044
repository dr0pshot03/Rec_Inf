ph sensing intracellular salmonella induces effector translocation 
salmonella enterica important intracellular bacterial pathogen humans animals replicates within host-cell vacuoles delivering virulence effector proteins vacuolar membrane pore made salmonella pathogenicity island spi- type iii secretion system t3ss t3ss assembly follows vacuole acidification bacteria grown low ph effector secretion negligible found effector secretion activated low ph mutant strains lacking complex spi--encoded proteins ssam spic ssal exposure wild-type bacteria ph growth ph caused dissociation degradation ssam/spic/ssal complexes effector secretion infected cells loss ph signal acidification host-cell cytosol prevented complex degradation effector translocation thus intravacuolar salmonella senses host cytosolic ph resulting degradation regulatory complex proteins effector translocation
