recent contributions glaciers ice caps sea level rise 
glaciers ice caps gics important contributors present-day global mean sea level rise- previous global mass balance estimates gics rely extrapolation sparse mass balance measurements representing small fraction gic area leaving overall contribution sea level rise unclear show gics excluding greenland antarctic peripheral gics lost mass rate +/ gt yr- january december contributing +/ mm yr- sea level rise results based global simultaneous inversion monthly grace-derived satellite gravity fields calculate mass change ice-covered regions greater area km gic rate per cent smaller previous mass balance estimate closely matches study period high mountains asia particular show mass loss +/ gt yr- compared gt yr- previously published estimates completeness also estimate greenland antarctic ice sheets including peripheral gics contributed +/ mm yr- sea level rise time period total contribution sea level rise ice-covered regions thus +/ mm yr- agrees well independent estimates sea level rise originating land ice loss terrestrial sources
