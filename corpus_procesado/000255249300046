ancient asteroids enriched refractory inclusions 
calcium aluminum rich inclusions cais occur classes chondritic meteorites contain refractory minerals predicted first condensates solar nebula near infrared spectra cais strong micrometer absorptions attributed iron oxide bearing aluminous spinel similar absorptions present telescopic spectra several asteroids modeling indicates contain similar +/ cais two three times meteorite survival undifferentiated large kilometer diameter cai rich bodies suggests may formed injection radiogenic al solar system also experienced modest post accretionary alteration thus asteroids higher concentrations cai material appear less altered ancient known sample meteorite collection making prime candidates sample return
