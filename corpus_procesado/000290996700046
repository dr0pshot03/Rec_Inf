structural basis methyl transfer radical sam enzyme 
radical s-adenosyl-l-methionine sam enzymes rlmn cfr methylate 23s ribosomal rna modifying c2 c8 position adenosine methyl groups installed two-step sequence involving initial methylation conserved cys residue rlmn cys355 sam methyl transfer substrate requires reductive cleavage second equivalent sam crystal structures rlmn rlmn sam show single molecule sam coordinates [4fe-4s] cluster residue cys355 s-methylated located proximal sam methyl group suggesting sam involved initial methyl transfer binds site thus rlmn accomplishes complex reaction structural economy harnessing two important reactivities sam within single site
