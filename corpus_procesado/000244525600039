topographic map recruitment spinal cord 
animals move range speeds using rhythmic networks neurons located spinal cord- use electrophysiology vivo imaging larval zebrafish danio rerio reveal systematic relationship location spinal neuron minimal swimming frequency neuron active ventral motor neurons excitatory interneurons rhythmically active lowest swimming frequencies increasingly dorsal excitatory neurons engaged swimming frequency rises inhibitory interneurons follow opposite pattern inverted patterns recruitment independent cell soma size among interneurons may partly explained concomitant dorso-ventral gradients input resistance laser ablations ventral dorsal excitatory interneurons perturb slow movements supporting behavioural role topography results reveal unexpected pattern organization within zebrafish spinal cord underlies production movements varying speeds
