transmitter-evoked local calcium release stabilizes developing dendrites 
central nervous system dendritic arborizations neurons undergo dynamic structural remodelling development processes elaborated maintained eliminated attain adult pattern synaptic connections- although neuronal activity influences remodelling- known activity exerts effects show neurotransmission evoked calcium ca2+ release intracellular stores stabilizes dendrites period synapse formation using ballistic labelling method load cells ca2+ indicator dyes simultaneously monitored dendritic activity structure intact retina two distinct patterns spontaneous ca2+ increases occurred developing retinal ganglion cells-global increases throughout arborization local flashes activity restricted small dendritic segments blockade local global activity caused rapid retraction dendrites retraction prevented locally focal uncaging caged ca2+ triggered ca2+ release internal stores thus local ca2+ release mechanism afferent activity can selectively differentially regulate dendritic structure across developing arborization
