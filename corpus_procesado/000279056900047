efficient quantum memory light 
storing retrieving quantum state light demand without corrupting information carries important challenge field quantum information processing classical measurement reconstruction strategies storing light must necessarily destroy quantum information consequence heisenberg uncertainty principle significant effort directed towards development devices so-called quantum memories-capable avoiding penalty far successful demonstrations- non-classical storage on-demand recall used atomic vapours limited low efficiencies less per cent using weak quantum states average photon number around one report low-noise highly efficient per cent quantum memory light uses solid-state medium device allows storage recall light faithfully possible using classical memory weak coherent states single-photon level bright states photons input coherent states containing average photons fewer performance exceeded no-cloning limit guaranteed information inputs retrieved memory left behind destroyed feature will provide security communications applications
