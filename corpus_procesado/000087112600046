coalescence single-walled carbon nanotubes
coalescence single-walled nanotubes studied situ electron irradiation high temperature transmission electron microscope merging process investigated atomic level using tight-binding molecular dynamics monte carte simulations vacancies induce coalescence via zipper-like mechanism imposing continuous reorganization atoms individual tube lattices along adjacent tubes topological defects induce polymerization tubes coalescence seems restricted tubes chirality explaining low frequency occurrence event
