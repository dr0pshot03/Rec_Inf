perceptual learning without perception 
brain able adapt rapidly continually surrounding environment becoming increasingly sensitive important frequently encountered stimuli1- often claimed adaptive learning highly task-specific become sensitive critical signals tasks attend to5- show new type perceptual learning occurs without attention without awareness without task relevance subjects repeatedly presented background motion signal weak direction visible; invisible motion irrelevant background central task engaged subjects attention despite threshold visibility irrelevant central task repetitive exposure improved performance specifically direction exposed motion tested subsequent suprathreshold test results suggest frequently presented feature sensitizes visual system merely owing frequency relevance salience
