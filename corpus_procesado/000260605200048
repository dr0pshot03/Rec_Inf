experimental evidence spatial self-organization emergent effects mussel bed ecosystems
spatial self organization main theoretical explanation global occurrence regular otherwise coherent spatial patterns ecosystems using mussel beds model ecosystem provide experimental demonstration spatial self organization homogeneous laboratory conditions mussels developed regular patterns similar field individual based model derived experiments showed interactions individuals explained observed patterns furthermore field study showed pattern formation affected ecosystem level processes terms improved growth resistance wave action results imply spatial self organization important determinant structure functioning ecosystems needs considered conservation
