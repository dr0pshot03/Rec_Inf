dendritic inhibition hippocampus supports fear learning
fear memories guide adaptive behavior contexts associated aversive events hippocampus forms neural representation context predicts aversive events representations context incorporate multisensory features environment must somehow exclude sensory features aversive event investigated selectivity using cell type-specific imaging inactivation hippocampal area ca1 behaving mice aversive stimuli activated ca1 dendrite-targeting interneurons via cholinergic input leading inhibition pyramidal cell distal dendrites receiving aversive sensory excitation entorhinal cortex inactivating dendrite-targeting interneurons aversive stimuli increased ca1 pyramidal cell population responses prevented fear learning propose subcortical activation dendritic inhibition mechanism exclusion aversive stimuli hippocampal contextual representations fear learning
