involuntary orienting sound improves visual perception
perceive real-world objects events need integrate several stimulus features belonging different sensory modalities although neural mechanisms behavioural consequences intersensory integration extensively studied- processes enable us pay attention multimodal objects still poorly understood important question whether stimulus one sensory modality automatically attracts attention spatially coincident stimuli appear subsequently modalities thereby enhancing perceptual salience occurrence irrelevant sound facilitate motor responses subsequent light appearing nearby- however participants previous studies made speeded responses rather psychophysical judgements remains unclear whether involuntary auditory attention actually affects perceptibility visual stimuli opposed postperceptual decision response processes provide psychophysical evidence sudden sound improves detectability subsequent flash appearing location data show involuntary orienting attention sound enhances early perceptual processing visual stimuli
