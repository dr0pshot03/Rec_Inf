coherent branched flow two-dimensional electron gas
semiconductor nanostructures based two-dimensional electron gases 2degs form basis future devices sensing information processing quantum computation although electron transport 2deg nanostructures well studied many remarkable phenomena already discovered example weak localization quantum chaos universal conductance fluctuations fundamental aspects electron flow structures far clarified however recently become possible image current directly 2deg devices using scanning probe microscope techniques- use technique observe electron flow narrow constriction 2deg-a quantum point contact images show electron flow point contact forms narrow branching strands instead smoothly spreading fans theoretical study flow indicates branching current flux due focusing electron paths ripples background potential strands decorated interference fringes separated half fermi wavelength indicating persistence quantum mechanical phase coherence electron flow findings may important implications better understanding electron transport 2degs design future nanostructure devices
