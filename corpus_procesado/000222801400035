x-ray outburst rapidly accreting young star illuminates mcneils nebula 
young low-mass stars luminous x-ray sources whose powerful x-ray flares- may exert profound influence process planet formation origin x-ray emission uncertain although many perhaps recently formed low-mass stars emit x-rays consequence solar-like coronal activity also suggested x-ray emission may direct result mass accretion onto forming star- report x-ray imaging spectroscopy observations reveal factor similar to50 increase x-ray flux young star present undergoing spectacular optical/infrared outburst star illuminates mcneils nebula outburst seems due sudden onset phase rapid accretion coincidence surge x-ray brightness optical/infrared eruption demonstrates strongly enhanced high-energy emission young stars can occur consequence high accretion rates suggest accretion-enhanced x-ray emission erupting young stars may short-lived intense star-disk magnetospheric interactions quenched rapidly subsequent flood new material onto star
