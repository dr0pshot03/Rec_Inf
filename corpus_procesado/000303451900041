evidence non-random mutation rates suggests evolutionary risk management strategy
central tenet evolutionary theory mutations occur randomly respect value organism selection governs whether fixed population principle challenged long-standing theoretical models predicting selection modulate rate mutation however understanding mutation rate varies different sites within genome hindered technical difficulties measuring present study overcomes previous limitations combining phylogenetic population genetic techniques upon comparing escherichia coli genomes observe neutral mutation rate varies order magnitude across genes mutational hot cold spots spanning several kilobases importantly variation random: detect lower rate highly expressed genes undergoing stronger purifying selection observations suggest mutation rate evolutionarily optimized reduce risk deleterious mutations current knowledge factors influencing mutation rate-including transcription-coupled repair context-dependent mutagenesis-do explain observations indicating additional mechanisms must involved findings important implications understanding evolution control mutations
