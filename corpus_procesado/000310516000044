quantum delayed-choice experiment 
quantum systems exhibit particle-or wavelike behavior depending experimental apparatus confronted wave-particle duality heart quantum mechanics paradoxical nature best captured delayed-choice thought experiment photon forced choose behavior observer decides measure report quantum delayed-choice experiment particle wave behaviors investigated simultaneously genuinely quantum nature photons behavior certified via nonlocality replaces delayed choice observer original experiment observed strong nonlocal correlations show photon must simultaneously behave particle wave
