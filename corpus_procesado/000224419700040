glycine-dependent riboswitch uses cooperative binding control gene expression 
identified previously unknown riboswitch class bacteria selectively triggered glycine representative glycine-sensing rnas bacillus subtilis operates rare genetic switch gcvt operon codes proteins form glycine cleavage system glycine riboswitches integrate two ligand-binding domains function cooperatively closely approximate two-state genetic switch advanced form riboswitch may evolved ensure excess glycine efficiently used provide carbon flux citric acid cycle maintain adequate amounts amino acid protein synthesis thus riboswitches perform key regulatory roles exhibit complex performance characteristics previously observed protein factors
