molecular mechanics cardiac myosin-binding protein c native thick filaments
hearts pumping capacity results highly regulated interactions actomyosin molecular motors mutations gene potential regulator motors cardiac myosin-binding protein c cmybp-c cause hypertrophic cardiomyopathy however cmybp-cs ability modulate cardiac contractility well understood using single-particle fluorescence imaging techniques transgenic protein expression proteomics modeling found cmybp-c slowed actomyosin motion generation native cardiac thick filaments mechanical effect localized cmybp-c resides within thick filament ie c-zones modulated phosphorylation site-specific proteolytic degradation results provide molecular insight cmybp-c considered member tripartite complex actin myosin allows fine tuning cardiac muscle contraction
