pilus retraction powers bacterial twitching motility
twitching social gliding motility allow many gram negative bacteria crawl along surfaces implicated wide range biological functions type iv pili tfp required twitching social gliding mechanism filaments promote motility remained enigmatic- use laser tweezers show tfp forcefully retract neisseria gonorrhoeae cells produce tfp actively crawl glass surface form adherent microcolonies laser tweezers used place hold cells near microcolony retractile forces pull cells toward microcolony quantitative experiments tfp immobilized bacteria bind latex beads retract pulling beads tweezers forces can exceed pn episodes retraction terminate release breakage tfp tether motility retraction mediated tfp occur mu m s- require protein synthesis function pilt protein experiments establish tfp filaments retract generate substantial force directly mediate cell movement
