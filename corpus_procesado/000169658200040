nitric oxide control firefly flashing
bioluminescent flashing essential firefly reproduction yet specific molecular mechanisms control light production well understood report light production fireflies can stimulated nitric oxide gas presence oxygen scavengers block bioluminescence induced neurotransmitter octopamine synthase robustly expressed firefly lantern cells interposed nerve endings light-producing photocytes results suggest synthesis key determinant flash control fireflies
