ubiquitin chain conformation regulates recognition activity interacting proteins 
mechanisms protein recognition extensively studied single-domain proteins1 less well characterized dynamic multidomain systems ubiquitin chains represent biologically important multidomain system requires recognition structurally diverse ubiquitin-interacting proteins23 ubiquitin chain conformations isolation often different conformations observed ubiquitin-interacting protein complexes indicating either great dynamic flexibility extensive chain remodelling upon binding using single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer show lys - lys met -linked diubiquitin exist several distinct conformational states solution lys met -linked diubiquitin adopt extended open compact closed conformations ubiquitin-binding domains deubiquitinases dubs select pre-existing conformations contrast lys -linked diubiquitin adopts predominantly compact conformations dubs directly recognize existing conformations may also remodel ubiquitin chains hydrolyse isopeptide bond disruption lys -diubiquitin interface changes conformational dynamics affects dub activity hence conformational equilibria ubiquitin chains provide additional layer regulation ubiquitin system distinct conformations observed differently linked polyubiquitin may contribute specificity ubiquitin-interacting proteins
