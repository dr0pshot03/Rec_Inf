mesenchymal-endothelial transition contributes cardiac neovascularization 
endothelial cells contribute subset cardiac fibroblasts undergoing endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition whether cardiac fibroblasts can adopt endothelial cell fate directly contribute neovascularization cardiac injury known using genetic fate map techniques demonstrate cardiac fibroblasts rapidly adopt endothelial-cell-like phenotype acute ischaemic cardiac injury fibroblast-derived endothelial cells exhibit anatomical functional characteristics native endothelial cells show transcription factor p53 regulates switch cardiac fibroblast fate loss p53 cardiac fibroblasts severely decreases formation fibroblast-derived endothelial cells reduces post-infarct vascular density worsens cardiac function conversely stimulation p53 pathway cardiac fibroblasts augments mesenchymal-to-endothelial transition enhances vascularity improves cardiac function observations demonstrate mesenchymal-to-endothelial transition contributes neovascularization injured heart represents potential therapeutic target enhancing cardiac repair
