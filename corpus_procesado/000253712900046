sequence variants rnf212 gene associate genome-wide recombination rate
genome wide recombination rate varies individuals mechanism controlling variation humans remained elusive genome wide search identified sequence variants 4p16 region correlated recombination rate males females variants located rnf212 gene putative ortholog zhp gene essential recombinations chiasma formation caenorhabditis elegans noteworthy haplotype formed two single nucleotide polymorphisms snps associated highest recombination rate males associated low recombination rate females consequently frequency haplotype changes average recombination rate will increase one sex decrease sex averaged recombination rate population can stay relatively constant
