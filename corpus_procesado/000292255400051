large sulfur isotope fractionation require disproportionation
composition sulfur isotopes sedimentary sulfides sulfates traces sulfur cycle throughout earths history particular depletions sulfur s sulfide relative sulfate exceeding per mil parts per thousand often serve proxy disproportionation intermediate sulfur species addition sulfate reduction demonstrate pure actively growing culture marine sulfate-reducing bacterium can deplete s parts per thousand sulfate reduction alone absence extracellular oxidative sulfur cycle therefore similar magnitudes sulfur isotope fractionation sedimentary rocks unambiguously record presence sulfur-based metabolisms stepwise oxygenation earths surface environment proterozoic
