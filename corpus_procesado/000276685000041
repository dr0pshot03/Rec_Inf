rapid diversification cell signaling phenotypes modular domain recombination 
cell signaling proteins often modular containing distinct catalytic regulatory domains recombination biological modules proposed major source evolutionary innovation systematically analyzed phenotypic diversity signaling response results domain recombination using proteins yeast mating pathway construct library chimeric domain recombinants domain recombination resulted greater diversity pathway response dynamics duplication genes single domains two unlinked domains domain recombination also led changes mating phenotype including recombinants increased mating efficiency wild type thus novel linkages preexisting domains may major role evolution protein networks novel phenotypic behaviors
