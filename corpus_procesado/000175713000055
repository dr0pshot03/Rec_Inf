induction suppression rna silencing animal virus 
rna silencing sequence-specific rna degradation mechanism operational plants animals show flock house virus fhv initiator target rna silencing drosophila host cells fhv infection requires suppression rna silencing fhv-encoded protein b2 findings establish rna silencing adaptive antiviral defense animal cells b2 also inhibits rna silencing transgenic plants providing evidence conserved rna silencing pathway plant animal kingdoms
