draxin repulsive guidance protein spinal cord forebrain commissures
axon guidance proteins critical correct wiring nervous system development several axon guidance cues family members well characterized unidentified axon guidance cues assumed participate formation extremely complex nervous system identified secreted protein draxin shares homology known guidance cues draxin inhibited repelled neurite outgrowth dorsal spinal cord cortical explants vitro ectopically expressed draxin inhibited growth caused misrouting chick spinal cord commissural axons vivo draxin knockout mice showed defasciculation spinal cord commissural axons absence forebrain commissures thus draxin previously unknown chemorepulsive axon guidance molecule required development spinal cord forebrain commissures
