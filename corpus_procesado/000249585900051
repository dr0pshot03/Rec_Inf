uhrf1 plays role maintaining dna methylation mammalian cells 
epigenetic inheritance mammals relies part robust propagation dna methylation patterns throughout development show protein uhrf1 ubiquitin-like containing phd ring finger domains also known np95 mouse icbp90 human required maintaining dna methylation uhrf1 colocalizes maintenance dna methyltransferase protein dnmt1 throughout s phase uhrf1 appears tether dnmt1 chromatin direct interaction dnmt1 furthermore uhrf1 contains methyl dna binding domain sra set ring associated domain shows strong preferential binding hemimethylated cg sites physiological substrate dnmt1 data suggest uhrf1 may help recruit dnmt1 hemimethylated dna facilitate faithful maintenance dna methylation
