cretaceous scleractinian coral calcitic skeleton 
generally thought scleractinian corals form purely aragonitic skeletons show well-preserved fossil coral coelosmilia sp upper cretaceous million years ago preserved skeletal structural features identical observed present-day scleractinians however skeleton coelosmilia sp entirely calcitic fine-scale structure chemistry indicate calcite primary form diagenetic alteration aragonite result implies corals like groups marine calcium carbonate-producing organisms can form skeletons different carbonate polymorphs
