p53 drug-induced apoptotic responses mediated bh3-only proteins puma noxa
apoptosis provoked dna damage requires p53 tumor suppressor many p53-regulated genes required remained unknown two genes induced transcription factor noxa puma bbc3 stand encode bh3-only proteins proapoptotic members bcl family required initiate apoptosis mice either noxa puma disrupted observed decreased dna damage-induced apoptosis fibroblasts although loss puma protected lymphocytes cell death puma deficiency also protected cells diverse p53-independent cytotoxic insults including cytokine deprivation exposure glucocorticoids kinase inhibitor staurosporine phorbol ester hence puma noxa critical mediators apoptotic responses induced p53 agents
