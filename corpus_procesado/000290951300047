improved molecular replacement density energy-guided protein structure optimization 
molecular replacement- procedures search placements starting model within crystallographic unit cell best account measured diffraction amplitudes followed automatic chain tracing methods- allowed rapid solution large numbers protein crystal structures despite extensive work- molecular replacement subsequent rebuilding usually fail divergent starting models based remote homologues less % sequence identity show limitation can substantially reduced combining algorithms protein structure modelling developed crystallographic structure determination approach integrating rosetta structure modelling autobuild chain tracing yielded high-resolution structures x-ray diffraction data sets solved laboratories expert crystallographers remained unsolved application extensive array alternative approaches estimate new method allow rapid structure determination without experimental phase information half cases current methods fail given diffraction data sets better angstrom resolution four fewer copies asymmetric unit availability structures homologous proteins >% sequence identity
