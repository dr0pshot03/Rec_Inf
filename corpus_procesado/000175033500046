cells compete decapentaplegic survival factor prevent apoptosis drosophila wing development 
growth drosophila imaginal discs process called cell competition eliminates slow-proliferating otherwise viable cells report cell competition requires function brinker brk gene whose expression normally repressed decapentaplegic dpp signalling- upregulated slow-growing minute/+ cells excess brk expression activates c-jun amino-terminal kinase pathway turn triggers apoptosis cells propose slow-proliferating cells upregulate brk levels owing disadvantage competing transducing dpp survival signal sequence events might represent general mechanism weaker cells eliminated growing population might serve method controlling cell number optimizing tissue fitness hence organ function
