dynamic binding orientations direct activity hiv reverse transcriptase
reverse transcriptase human immunodeficiency virus hiv catalyses series reactions convert single stranded rna genome hiv double stranded dna host cell integration task requires reverse transcriptase discriminate variety nucleic acid substrates active sites enzyme correctly positioned support one three catalytic functions: rna directed dna synthesis dna directed dna synthesis dna directed rna hydrolysis however mechanism substrates regulate reverse transcriptase activities remains unclear report distinct orientational dynamics reverse transcriptase observed different substrates single molecule assay enzyme adopted opposite binding orientations duplexes containing dna rna primers directing dna synthesis rna hydrolysis activity respectively duplexes containing unique polypurine rna primers plus strand dna synthesis enzyme can rapidly switch two orientations switching kinetics regulated cognate nucleotides non nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors major class anti hiv drugs results indicate activities reverse transcriptase determined binding orientation substrates
