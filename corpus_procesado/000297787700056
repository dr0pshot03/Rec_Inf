perceptual learning incepted decoded fmri neurofeedback without stimulus presentation
controversial whether adult primate early visual cortex sufficiently plastic cause visual perceptual learning vpl controversy occurs partially vpl studies examined correlations behavioral neural activity changes rather cause-and-effect relationships online-feedback method uses decoded functional magnetic resonance imaging fmri signals induced activity patterns early visual cortex corresponding orientation without stimulus presentation participants awareness learned induced activation caused vpl specific orientation results suggest early visual areas plastic mere inductions activity patterns sufficient cause vpl technique can induce plasticity highly selective manner potentially leading powerful training rehabilitative protocols
