dna-templated organic synthesis selection library macrocycles 
translation nucleic acid libraries corresponding synthetic compounds enable selection amplification principles applied man-made molecules used multistep dna-templated organic synthesis translate libraries dna sequences containing three "codons" libraries sequence-programmed synthetic small-molecule macrocycles resulting dna-macrocycle conjugates subjected vitro selections protein affinity identity single macrocycle possessing known target protein affinity inferred sequence amplified dna template surviving selection work represents translation selection amplification libraries nucleic acids encoding synthetic small molecules rather biological macromolecules
