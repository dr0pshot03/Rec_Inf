topoisomerases facilitate transcription long genes linked autism
topoisomerases expressed throughout developing adult brain mutated individuals autism spectrum disorder asd however topoisomerases mechanistically connected asd unknown find topotecan topoisomerase top1 inhibitor dose-dependently reduces expression extremely long genes mouse human neurons including nearly genes longer kilobases expression long genes also reduced knockdown top1 top2b neurons highlighting enzymes required full expression long genes mapping rna polymerase ii density genome-wide neurons found length-dependent effect gene expression due impaired transcription elongation interestingly many high-confidence asd candidate genes exceptionally long reduced expression top1 inhibition findings suggest chemicals genetic mutations impair topoisomerases commonly contribute asd neurodevelopmental disorders
