n-type conducting cdse nanocrystal solids 
bottleneck limiting widespread application semiconductor nanocrystal solids poor conductivity report conductivity thin films n-type cdse nanocrystals increases many orders magnitude occupation first two electronic shells 1se 1pe increases either potassium electrochemical doping around half-filling 1se shell peak conductivity observed indicating shell-to-shell transport introducing conjugated ligands nanocrystals increases conductivities states similar to10- siemens per centimeter
