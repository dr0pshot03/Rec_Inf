asymmetric catalysis transannular diels-alder reaction
transannular chemical reactions unparalleled ability generate high degrees stereochemical architectural complexity single transformation however successful application approach synthesis depends ability predict control outcome transannular reaction use chiral catalyst context represents attractive yet unused strategy report describes catalytic asymmetric transannnular diels-alder tada reaction affords polycyclic products high enantiomeric excess catalyst system can also alter inherent diastereoselectivity cyclizations substrates containing chiral centers additionally catalytic enantioselective tada used key step total synthesis sesquiterpene -diacetoxydrimane route may provide general approach polycyclic carbon framework shared many terpene natural products
