inflammatory blockade restores adult hippocampal neurogenesis 
cranial radiation therapy causes progressive decline cognitive function linked impaired neurogenesis chronic inflammation accompanies radiation injury suggesting inflammatory processes may contribute neural stem cell dysfunction show neuroinflammation alone inhibits neurogenesis inflammatory blockade indomethacin common nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug restores neurogenesis endotoxin-induced inflammation augments neurogenesis cranial irradiation
