terraces phylogenetic tree space
key step assembling tree life construction species-rich phylogenies multilocus-but often incomplete-sequence data sets describe previously unknown structure landscape solutions tree reconstruction problem comprising sometimes vast terraces trees identical quality arranged islands phylogenetically similar trees phylogenetic ambiguity within terrace can characterized efficiently ameliorated new algorithms obtaining terraces maximum-agreement subtree identifying smallest set new targets additional sequencing algorithms find optimal trees estimate bayesian posterior tree distributions may need navigate strategically neighborhood large terraces tree space
