revealing natures cellulase diversity: digestion mechanism caldicellulosiruptor bescii cela 
fungi bacteria degrade plant cell walls secreting free complementary enzymes hydrolyze cellulose; however bacteria use large enzymatic assemblies called cellulosomes recruit complementary enzymes protein scaffolds thermophilic bacterium caldicellulosiruptor bescii uses intermediate strategy secreting many free cellulases contain multiple catalytic domains one cela comprises glycoside hydrolase family family catalytic domain well three type iii cellulose-binding modules saccharification common cellulose standard avicel cela outperforms mixtures commercially relevant exo endoglucanases transmission electron microscopy studies cellulose incubation cela report morphological features suggest cela exploits common surface ablation mechanism driven general cellulase processivity also excavates extensive cavities surface substrate results suggest natures repertoire cellulose digestion paradigms remain partially discovered understood
