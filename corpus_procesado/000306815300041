live imaging stem cell progeny behaviour physiological hair-follicle regeneration
tissue development regeneration depend cell-cell interactions signals target stem cells immediate progeny however cellular behaviours lead properly regenerated tissue well understood using new non-invasive intravital two-photon imaging approach study physiological hair-follicle regeneration time live mice means monitored behaviour epithelial stem cells progeny- physiological hair regeneration addressed mesenchyme influences behaviour consistent earlier studies stem cells quiescent initial stages hair regeneration whereas progeny actively dividing moreover stem cell progeny divisions spatially organized within follicles addition cell divisions coordinated cell movements progeny allow rapid expansion hair follicle finally show requirement mesenchyme hair regeneration targeted cell ablation long-term tracking live hair follicles thus established vivo approach led direct observation cellular mechanisms growth regulation within hair follicle enabled us precisely investigate functional requirements hair-follicle components process physiological regeneration
