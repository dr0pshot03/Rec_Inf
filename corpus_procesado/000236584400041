platelet-derived serotonin mediates liver regeneration 
liver can regenerate volume major tissue loss mouse model liver regeneration thrombocytopenia impaired platelet activity resulted failure initiate cellular proliferation liver platelets major carriers serotonin blood thrombocytopenic mice serotonin agonist reconstituted liver proliferation expression ht2a 2b subtype serotonin receptors liver increased hepatectomy antagonists ht2a 2b receptors inhibited liver regeneration liver regeneration also blunted mice lacking tryptophan hydroxylase rate-limiting enzyme synthesis peripheral serotonin failure regeneration rescued reloading serotonin-free platelets serotonin precursor molecule results suggest platelet-derived serotonin involved initiation liver regeneration
