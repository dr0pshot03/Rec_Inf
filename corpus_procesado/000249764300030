dark side rings uranus 
rings uranus oriented edge-on earth first time since discovery event provides rare opportunity observe dark unlit side dense rings darken near invisibility faint rings become much brighter present ground-based infrared image unlit side rings shows system changed dramatically since previous views broad cloud faint material permeates system correlated well-known narrow rings embedded dust belts imaged voyager spacecraft although differences can explained unusual viewing angle conclude dust distribution within system changed substantially since voyager encounter occurs much larger scales seen planetary systems
