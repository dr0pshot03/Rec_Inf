conductance switching single molecules conformational changes 
tracked time conductance switching single bundled phenylene ethynylene oligomers isolated matrices alkanethiolate monolayers persistence times isolated bundled molecules either switch state range seconds tens hours surrounding matrix well ordered rate inserted molecules switch low conversely surrounding matrix poorly ordered inserted molecules switch often conclude switching result conformational changes molecules bundles rather electrostatic effects charge transfer
