motor antagonism exposed spatial segregation timing neurogenesis 
walking key motor behaviour limbed animals executed contraction functionally antagonistic muscle groups swing stance phases nevertheless neuronal circuits regulating activation antagonistic extensor-flexor muscles remain poorly understood use monosynaptically restricted trans-synaptic viruses elucidate premotor anatomical substrates extensor-flexor control mice observe medio-lateral spatial segregation extensor flexor premotor interneurons dorsal spinal cord premotor interneuron populations derived common progenitor domains segregate timing neurogenesis find proprioceptive sensory feedback periphery targeted medial extensor premotor populations required extensor-specific connectivity profiles development findings provide evidence discriminating anatomical basis antagonistic circuits level premotor interneurons point synaptic input developmental ontogeny key factors establishment circuits regulating motor behavioural dichotomy
