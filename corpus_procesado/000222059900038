local-feature assembling visual pattern recognition generalization honeybees 
generalization cognitive ability allows similar stimuli along given dimension treated equivalents1- insects exhibit high levels visual generalization4- honeybees trained recognize complex visual stimuli basis single feature generalize choice novel stimuli sharing common feature trained stimuli7 demonstration kind performance limited use single visual feature possibility bees link different features learning visual pattern denied89 show honeybees trained series complex patterns sharing common layout comprising four edge orientations remember orientations simultaneously appropriate positions generalize response novel stimuli preserve trained layout honeybees also generalize response patterns fewer correct orientations depending match trained layout stimulation achromatic l-photoreceptor input necessary task mini-brain honeybee can thus extract regularities environment establish correspondences among correlated features can thus generate large set object descriptions finite set elements
