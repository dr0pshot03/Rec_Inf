role cell-cycle-regulated histone h3 lysine acetylation dna damage response
dna breaks extremely harmful lesions need repaired efficiently throughout genome however packaging dna nucleosomes significant barrier dna repair mechanisms repair context chromatin poorly understood show lysine k56 acetylation abundant modification newly synthesized histone h3 molecules incorporated chromosomes s phase defects acetylation k56 histone h3 result sensitivity genotoxic agents cause dna strand breaks replication absence dna damage acetylation histone h3 k56 largely disappears g2 contrast cells dna breaks maintain high levels acetylation persistence modification dependent dna damage checkpoint proteins suggest acetylation histone h3 k56 creates favourable chromatin environment dna repair key component dna damage response preserve acetylation
