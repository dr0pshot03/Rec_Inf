orphan g protein-coupled receptor modulates amyloid-beta peptide generation neurons
deposition amyloid-beta peptide pathological hallmark alzheimers disease high throughput functional genomics screen identified g protein coupled receptor gpr3 constitutively active orphan g protein coupled receptor modulator amyloid-beta production overexpression gpr3 stimulated amyloid-beta production whereas genetic ablation gpr3 prevented accumulation amyloid-beta peptide vitro alzheimers disease mouse model gpr3 expression led increased formation cell surface localization mature gamma-secretase complex absence effect notch processing gpr3 highly expressed areas normal human brain implicated alzheimers disease elevated sporadic alzheimers disease brain thus gpr3 represents potential therapeutic target treatment alzheimers disease
