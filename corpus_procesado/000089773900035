interconversion single double helices formed synthetic molecular strands
synthetic single-helical conformations quite common formation double helices based recognition two constituent strands relatively rare known examples include duplex formation base-pair-specific hydrogen bonding stacking found nucleic acids analogues polypeptides composed amino acids alternating l d configurations synthetic polymers self-assembled fibres double-helical winding induced van der waals interactions third mode non-covalent interaction coordination organic ligands metal ions- can give rise double triple quadruple helices although case assembly driven coordination geometry metal structure ligands rather direct inter-strand complementarity describe family oligomeric molecules bent conformations exhibit dynamic exchange single double molecular helices solution spiral sliding synthetic oligomer strands bent conformations leading helical shape molecules result intramolecular hydrogen bonding within -pyridyl--pyridinecarboxamide units- extensive intermolecular aromatic stacking stabilizing double-stranded helices form dimerization
