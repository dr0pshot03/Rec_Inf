complete photo-induced breakup h molecule probe molecular electron correlation
despite decades progress quantum mechanics electron correlation effects still partially understood experiments electrons ejected oriented hydrogen molecule absorption single photon recently demonstrated puzzling phenomenon: ejection pattern electrons depends sensitively bond distance two nuclei vibrate ground state report complete numerical solution schrodinger equation double photoionization h- results suggest distribution photoelectrons emitted aligned molecules reflects electron correlation effects purely molecular origin
