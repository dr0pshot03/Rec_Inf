haploid plants produced centromere-mediated genome elimination 
production haploid plants inherit chromosomes one parent can greatly accelerate plant breeding- haploids generated heterozygous individual converted diploid create instant homozygous lines bypassing generations inbreeding two methods generally used produce haploids first cultured gametophyte cells may regenerated haploid plants many species genotypes recalcitrant process second haploids can induced rare interspecific crosses one parental genome eliminated fertilization- molecular basis genome elimination understood one theory posits centromeres two parent species interact unequally mitotic spindle causing selective chromosome loss- show haploid arabidopsis thaliana plants can easily generated seeds manipulating single centromere protein centromere-specific histone cenh3 called cenp-a human cenh3 null mutants expressing altered cenh3 proteins crossed wild type chromosomes mutant eliminated producing haploid progeny haploids spontaneously converted fertile diploids meiotic non-reduction allowing genotype perpetuated maternal paternal haploids can generated reciprocal crosses also exploited centromere-mediated genome elimination convert natural tetraploid arabidopsis diploid reducing ploidy simplify breeding cenh3 universal eukaryotes method may extended produce haploids plant species
