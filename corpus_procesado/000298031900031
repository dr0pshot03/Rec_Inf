case climate regulation via oceanic phytoplankton sulphur emissions 
twenty years ago biological regulation climate proposed whereby emissions dimethyl sulphide oceanic phytoplankton resulted formation aerosol particles acted cloud condensation nuclei marine boundary layer hypothesis-referred claw-the increase cloud condensation nuclei led increase cloud albedo resulting changes temperature radiation initiating climate feedback altering dimethyl sulphide emissions phytoplankton past two decades observations marine boundary layer laboratory studies modelling efforts conducted seeking evidence claw hypothesis results indicate dimethyl sulphide biological control cloud condensation nuclei probably exist sources nuclei marine boundary layer response clouds changes aerosol much complex recognized twenty years ago results indicate time retire claw hypothesis
