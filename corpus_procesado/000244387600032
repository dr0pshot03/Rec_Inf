ex situ nmr highly homogeneous fields: h spectroscopy
portable single-sided nuclear magnetic resonance nmr magnets used nondestructive studies large samples believed generate inherently inhomogeneous magnetic fields demonstrated experimentally field open magnet can shimmed high homogeneity large volume external sensor technique allowed us measure localized high-resolution proton spectra outside portable open magnet spectral resolution part per million generation experimental conditions also simplifies implementation powerful methodologies multidimensional nmr spectroscopy imaging
