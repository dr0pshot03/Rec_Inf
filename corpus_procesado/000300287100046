cancer exome analysis reveals t-cell-dependent mechanism cancer immunoediting 
cancer immunoediting process immune system controls tumour outgrowth shapes tumour immunogenicity comprised three phases: elimination equilibrium escape- although many immune components participate process known underlying mechanisms remain poorly defined central tenet cancer immunoediting t-cell recognition tumour antigens drives immunological destruction sculpting developing cancer however current understanding tumour antigens comes largely analyses cancers develop immunocompetent hosts thus may already edited little known antigens expressed nascent tumour cells whether sufficient induce protective antitumour immune responses whether expression modulated immune system using massively parallel sequencing characterize expressed mutations highly immunogenic methylcholanthrene-induced sarcomas derived immunodeficient rag2-/- mice phenotypically resemble nascent primary tumour cells using class prediction algorithms identify mutant spectrin-beta potential rejection antigen d42m1 sarcoma validate prediction conventional antigen expression cloning detection also demonstrate cancer immunoediting d42m1 occurs via t-cell-dependent immunoselection process promotes outgrowth pre-existing tumour cell clones lacking highly antigenic mutant spectrin-beta potential strong antigens results demonstrate strong immunogenicity unedited tumour can ascribed expression highly antigenic mutant proteins show outgrowth tumour cells lack strong antigens via t-cell-dependent immunoselection process represents one mechanism cancer immunoediting
