logical computation using algorithmic self-assembly dna triple-crossover molecules 
recent work1- demonstrated self-assembly designed periodic two-dimensional arrays composed dna tiles intermolecular contacts directed sticky ends mathematical context aperiodic mosaics may formed self-assembly wang tiles4 process emulates operation turing machine macroscopic self-assembly used perform computations5; also logical equivalence dna sticky ends wang tile edges67 suggests self-assembly dna-based tiles used perform dna-based computation8 algorithmic aperiodic self-assembly requires greater fidelity periodic self-assembly correct tiles must compete partially correct tiles report one-dimensional algorithmic self-assembly dna triple-crossover molecules9 can used execute four steps logical cumulative xor operation string binary bits
