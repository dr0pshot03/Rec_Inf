logical computation using algorithmic self-assembly dna triple-crossover molecules
recent work- demonstrated self-assembly designed periodic two-dimensional arrays composed dna tiles intermolecular contacts directed sticky ends mathematical context aperiodic mosaics may formed self-assembly wang tiles process emulates operation turing machine macroscopic self-assembly used perform computations also logical equivalence dna sticky ends wang tile edges suggests self-assembly dna-based tiles used perform dna-based computation algorithmic aperiodic self-assembly requires greater fidelity periodic self-assembly correct tiles must compete partially correct tiles report one-dimensional algorithmic self-assembly dna triple-crossover molecules can used execute four steps logical cumulative xor operation string binary bits
