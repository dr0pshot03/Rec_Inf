role excited-state topology three-body dissociation sym-triazine 
molecular fragmentation three products poses analytical challenge theory experiment alike used translational spectroscopy high-level ab initio calculations explore highly debated three-body dissociation sym-triazine three hydrogen cyanide molecules dissociation induced charge exchange sym-triazine radical cation cesium calculated state energies electronic couplings suggest reduction initially produces population sym-triazine partitioned 3s rydberg pi* < n electronically excited manifolds analysis topology manifolds along momentum correlation dissociation products suggests conical intersection two potential energy surfaces 3s rydberg manifold leads stepwise dissociation whereas four-fold glancing intersection pi* < n manifold leads symmetric concerted reaction
