pre-target axon sorting establishes neural map topography
sensory information detected peripheral nervous system represented topographic map brain long thought topography map determined graded positional cues expressed target analyzed pre-target axon sorting olfactory map formation mice olfactory sensory neurons axon guidance receptor neuropilin- repulsive ligand semaphorin-3a expressed complementary manner found expression levels neuropilin determined pre-target sorting projection sites axons olfactory sensory neuron-specific knockout semaphorin-3a perturbed axon sorting altered olfactory map topography thus pre-target axon sorting plays important role establishing topographic order based relative levels guidance molecules expressed axons
