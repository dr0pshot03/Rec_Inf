subcellular homeostasis phytohormone auxin mediated er-localized pin5 transporter 
plant signalling molecule auxin provides positional information variety developmental processes means differential distribution gradients within plant tissues thus cellular auxin levels often determine developmental output auxin signalling conceptually transmembrane transport metabolic processes regulate steady-state levels auxin given cell particular pin auxin-efflux-carrier-mediated directional transport cells crucial generating auxin gradients show arabidopsis thaliana pin5 atypical member pin gene family encodes functional auxin transporter required auxin-mediated development pin5 direct role cell-to-cell transport regulates intracellular auxin homeostasis metabolism pin5 localizes unlike characterized plasma membrane pin proteins endoplasmic reticulum er presumably mediating auxin flow cytosol lumen er er localization pin5-like transporters including moss pin indicates diversification pin protein functions mediating auxin homeostasis er cell-to-cell auxin transport plasma membrane represent ancient event evolution land plants
