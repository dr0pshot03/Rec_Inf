direct measurement light waves 
electromagnetic field visible light performs similar to10 oscillations per second although many instruments sensitive amplitude frequency wavelength oscillations access light field directly observed field built disappeared short few-cycle pulse visible laser light probing variation field strength attosecond electron burst apparatus allows complete characterization few-cycle waves visible ultraviolet and/or infrared light thereby providing possibility controlled reproducible synthesis ultrabroadband light waveforms
