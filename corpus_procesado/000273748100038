telescopic measurements asteroids colours rarely match laboratory reflectance spectra meteorites owing space weathering process rapidly reddens asteroid surfaces less years unweathered asteroids spectra matching commonly falling ordinary chondrite meteorites however seen among small bodies orbits cross inside mars earth various explanations proposed origin fresh surface colours ranging collisions planetary encounters less reddened asteroids seem cross deeply terrestrial planet region strengthening evidence planetary-encounter theory encounter details within years remain shown report asteroids displaying unweathered spectra so-called q-types experienced orbital intersections closer earth-moon distance within past x years q-type asteroids currently found among asteroids showing evidence recent close planetary encounters results substantiate previous work: tidal stress strong enough disturb expose unweathered surface grains likely dominant short-term asteroid resurfacing process although seismology details yet worked identification rapid physical processes can produce fresh weathered asteroid surfaces resolves decades-long puzzle difference colour asteroids meteorites
