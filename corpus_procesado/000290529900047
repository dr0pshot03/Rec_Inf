experimental evidence supports sex-specific selective sieve mitochondrial genome evolution 
mitochondria maternally transmitted hence genome can make direct adaptive response selection females whereas males represent evolutionary dead end theory creates sex-specific selective sieve enabling deleterious mutations accumulate mitochondrial genomes exert male-specific effects tested hypothesis expressing five mitochondrial variants alongside standard nuclear genome drosophila melanogaster found striking sexual asymmetry patterns nuclear gene expression mitochondrial polymorphism effects nuclear gene expression females major effects males modifying nearly % transcripts mostly male-biased expression enrichment hotspots testes accessory glands results suggest evolutionary mechanism results mitochondrial genomes harboring male-specific mutation loads
