powerful chiral counterion strategy asymmetric transition metal catalysis 
traditionally transition metal-catalyzed enantioselective transformations rely chiral ligands tightly bound metal induce asymmetric product distributions report high enantioselectivities conferred chiral counterion metal-catalyzed reaction two different transformations catalyzed cationic gold complexes generated products % enantiomeric excess use chiral binaphthol-derived phosphate anions furthermore show chiral counterion can combined additively chiral ligands enable asymmetric transformation achieved either method alone concept relaying chiral information via ion pair applicable vast number metal-mediated processes
