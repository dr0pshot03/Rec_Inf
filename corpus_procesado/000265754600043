kondo effect ferromagnetic atomic contacts 
iron cobalt nickel archetypal ferromagnetic metals bulk electronic conduction materials takes place mainly s p electrons whereas magnetic moments mostly narrow d-electron bands tend align general picture may change nanoscale electrons surfaces materials experience interactions differ bulk show direct evidence changes: electronic transport atomic-scale contacts pure ferromagnets iron cobalt nickel despite strong bulk ferromagnetism unexpectedly reveal kondo physics screening local magnetic moments conduction electrons characteristic temperature kondo effect creates sharp resonance fermi energy affecting electrical properties system appears fano-kondo resonance conductance characteristics observed artificial nanostructures- study hundreds contacts shows material-dependent log-normal distributions resonance width arise naturally kondo theory resonances broaden disappear increasing temperature also standard kondo systems- observations supported calculations imply coordination changes can significantly modify magnetism nanoscale therefore addition standard micromagnetic physics strong electronic correlations along atomic-scale geometry need considered investigating magnetic properties magnetic nanostructures
