formation black hole dark 
show black hole x-ray binary cygnus x- formed situ receive energetic trigger nearby supernova progenitor black hole initial mass greater solar masses collapse form similar to10-solar mass black hole cygnus x- upper limit mass suddenly ejected similar to1 solar mass much less mass ejected supernova observations suggest high-mass stellar black holes may form promptly massive stars disappear silently
