diversity dynamics dendritic signaling 
communication neurons brain occurs primarily synapses made onto elaborate treelike structures called dendrites new electrical optical recording techniques led tremendous advances understanding dendrites contribute neuronal computation mammalian brain varied morphology electrical chemical properties dendrites enable spectrum local long-range signaling defining input-output relationship neurons rules induction synaptic plasticity way diversity dendritic signaling allows individual neurons carry specialized functions within respective networks
