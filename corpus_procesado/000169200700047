microbial genes human genome: lateral transfer gene loss
human genome analyzed evidence genes laterally transferred genome prokaryotic organisms protein sequence comparisons proteomes human fruit fly nematode worm yeast mustard weed eukaryotic parasites completed prokaryote genomes performed genes shared human groups organisms collected genes found exclusively shared humans bacteria candidate examples horizontal transfer bacteria vertebrates gene loss combined sample size effects evolutionary rate variation provide alternative biologically plausible explanation
