variability gene expression underlies incomplete penetrance 
phenotypic differences individual organisms can often ascribed underlying genetic environmental variation however even genetically identical organisms homogeneous environments vary indicating randomness developmental processes gene expression may also generate diversity examine consequences gene expression variability multicellular organisms studied intestinal specification nematode caenorhabditis elegans wild-type cell fate invariant controlled small transcriptional network mutations elements network can indeterminate effects: mutant embryos fail develop intestinal cells whereas others produce intestinal precursors counting transcripts genes network individual embryos show expression otherwise redundant gene becomes highly variable mutants variation subjected threshold producing on/off expression pattern master regulatory gene intestinal differentiation results demonstrate mutations developmental networks can expose otherwise buffered stochastic variability gene expression leading pronounced phenotypic variation
