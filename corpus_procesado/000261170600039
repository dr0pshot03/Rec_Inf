plant growth development sustained meristems meristem activity controlled auxin cytokinin two hormones whose interactions determining specific developmental output still poorly understood means comprehensive genetic molecular analysis arabidopsis show primary cytokinin response transcription factor arr1 activates gene shy2/iaa3 shy2 repressor auxin signaling negatively regulates pin auxin transport facilitator genes: thereby cytokinin causes auxin redistribution prompting cell differentiation conversely auxin mediates degradation shy2 protein sustaining pin activities cell division thus cell differentiation division balance necessary controlling root meristem size root growth result interaction cytokinin auxin simple regulatory circuit converging shy2 gene
