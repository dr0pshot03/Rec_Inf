non-cell autonomous role ez prevent germ cells turning somatic cell marker
many metazoans germ cells separated somatic lineages early development maintain identity throughout life show polycomb group pcg component enhancer zeste [ez] histone transferase generates trimethylation lysine histone h3 maintains germline identity drosophila adult testes find excessive early-stage somatic gonadal cells ez mutant testes originate overproliferative cyst stem cells germ cells turning early-stage somatic cell marker using complementary lineage-tracing experiments ez mutant testes portion excessive early-stage somatic gonadal cells found originate early-stage germ cells including germline stem cells moreover knocking ez specifically somatic cells caused change suggests non-cell autonomous role ez antagonize somatic identity germ cells
