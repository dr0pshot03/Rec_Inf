direct observation widely tunable bandgap bilayer graphene 
electronic bandgap intrinsic property semiconductors insulators largely determines transport optical properties central role modern device physics technology governs operation semiconductor devices p-n junctions transistors photodiodes lasers tunable bandgap highly desirable allow great flexibility design optimization devices particular tuned applying variable external electric field however conventional materials bandgap fixed crystalline structure preventing bandgap control demonstrate realization widely tunable electronic bandgap electrically gated bilayer graphene using dual-gate bilayer graphene field-effect transistor fet infrared microspectroscopy- demonstrate gate-controlled continuously tunable bandgap mev technique avoids uncontrolled chemical doping- provides direct evidence widely tunable bandgap-spanning spectral range zero mid-infrared-that eluded previous attempts combined remarkable electrical transport properties systems electrostatic bandgap control suggests novel nanoelectronic nanophotonic device applications based graphene
