p53 dynamics control cell fate 
cells transmit information molecular signals often show complex dynamical patterns dynamic behavior tumor suppressor p53 varies depending stimulus; response double-strand dna breaks shows series repeated pulses using computational model identified sequence precisely timed drug additions alter p53 pulses instead produce sustained p53 response leads expression different set downstream genes also alters cell fate: cells experience p53 pulses recover dna damage whereas cells exposed sustained p53 signaling frequently undergo senescence results show protein dynamics can important part signal directly influencing cellular fate decisions
