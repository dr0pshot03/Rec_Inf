bacterial disease resistance arabidopsis flagellin perception 
plants animals recognize microbial invaders detecting pathogen-associated molecular patterns pamps1- flagellin6- however importance flagellin perception disease resistance now demonstrated7- show treatment plants flg22 peptide representing elicitor-active epitope flagellin6 induces expression numerous defence-related genes triggers resistance pathogenic bacteria wild-type plants plants carrying mutations flagellin receptor gene fls2 induced resistance seems independent salicylic acid jasmonic acid ethylene signalling wild-type fls2 mutants display enhanced resistance treated crude bacterial extracts even devoid elicitor-active flagellin indicating existence functional perception systems pamps flagellin although fls2 mutant plants susceptible wild type bacteria infiltrated leaves susceptible pathogen pseudomonas syringae pv tomato dc3000 sprayed leaf surface thus flagellin perception restricts bacterial invasion probably early step contributes plants disease resistance
