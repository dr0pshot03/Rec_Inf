resonant auger decay driving intermolecular coulombic decay molecular dimers
predicted electronically excited atom molecule placed loosely bound chemical system hydrogen-bonded van-der-waals bonded cluster efficiently decay transferring excess energy neighbouring species emit low-energy electron intermolecular coulombic decay icd process since shown common phenomenon- raising questions role dna damage induced ionizing radiation low-energy electrons known play important part recently suggested icd can triggered efficiently site-selectively resonantly core-exciting target atom transforms auger decay ionic species sufficiently high excitation energy permit icd occur show experimentally resonant auger decay can indeed trigger icd dimers molecular nitrogen carbon monoxide using ion electron momentum spectroscopy measure simultaneously charged species created resonant-auger-driven icd cascade find icd occurs less time femtoseconds take individual molecules undergo dissociation experimental confirmation process efficiency may trigger renewed efforts develop resonant x-ray excitation schemes localized targeted cancer radiation therapy
