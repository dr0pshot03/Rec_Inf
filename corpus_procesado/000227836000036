orbital kondo effect carbon nanotubes 
progress fabrication nanometre-scale electronic devices opening new opportunities uncover deeper aspects kondo effect characteristic phenomenon physics strongly correlated electrons artificial single-impurity kondo systems realized various nanostructures including semiconductor quantum dots- carbon nanotubes individual molecules kondo effect usually regarded spin-related phenomenon namely coherent exchange spin localized state fermi sea delocalized electrons principle however role spin replaced degrees freedom orbital quantum number show unique electronic structure carbon nanotubes enables observation purely orbital kondo effect use magnetic field tune spin-polarized states orbital degeneracy conclude orbital quantum number conserved tunnelling orbital spin degeneracies present simultaneously observe strongly enhanced kondo effect multiple splitting kondo resonance finite field predicted obey so-called su symmetry
