crispr/cas bacterial immune system cleaves bacteriophage plasmid dna
bacteria archaea developed several defence strategies foreign nucleic acids viral genomes plasmids among clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats crispr loci together cas crispr-associated genes form crispr/cas immune system involves partially palindromic repeats separated short stretches dna called spacers acquired extrachromosomal elements recently demonstrated variable loci can incorporate spacers infecting bacteriophages provide immunity subsequent bacteriophage infections sequence-specific manner show streptococcus thermophilus crispr1/cas system can also naturally acquire spacers self-replicating plasmid containing antibiotic-resistance gene leading plasmid loss acquired spacers match antibiotic-resistance genes provide novel means naturally select bacteria uptake disseminate genes also provide vivo evidence crispr1/cas system specifically cleaves plasmid bacteriophage double-stranded dna within proto-spacer specific sites data show crispr/cas immune system remarkably adapted cleave invading dna rapidly potential exploitation generate safer microbial strains
