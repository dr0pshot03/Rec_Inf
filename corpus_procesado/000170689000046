virus-mediated killing cells lack p53 activity 
major goal molecular oncology identify means kill cells lacking p53 function current cancer therapy based damaging cellular dna irradiation chemicals recent reports support notion event dna damage p53 tumour-suppressor protein able prevent cell death sustaining arrest cell cycle g2 phase report adeno-associated virus aav selectively induces apoptosis cells lack active p53 cells intact p53 activity killed undergo arrest g2 phase cell cycle arrest characterized increase p53 activity p21 levels targeted destruction cdc25c neither cell killing arrest depends upon aav-encoded proteins rather aav dna single-stranded hairpin structures ends elicits cells dna damage response absence active p53 leads cell death aav inhibits tumour growth mice thus viruses can used deliver dna unusual structure cells trigger dna damage response without damaging cellular dna selectively eliminate cells lacking p53 activity
