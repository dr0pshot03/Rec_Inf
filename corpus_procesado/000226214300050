disulfide isomerization membrane release sar domain activates p1 lysozyme 
p1 lysozyme lyz secreted periplasm escherichia coli accumulates inactive membra ne-tethered form genetic biochemical experiments show released bilayer lyz activated intramolecular thiol-disulfide isomerization requires cysteine n-terminal sar signal-arrest-release domain crystal structures confirm alternative disulfide linkages two forms lyz reveal dramatic conformational differences catalytic domain thus exported p1 endolysin kept inactive three levels control-topological conformational covalent-until release membrane triggered p1 holin
