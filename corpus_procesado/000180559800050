cellular molecular origins beak morphology 
cellular molecular mechanisms underlying differences beak morphology likely involve interactions among multiple embryonic populations exchanged neural crest cells destined participate beak morphogenesis two anatomically distinct species quail neural crest cells produced quail beaks duck hosts duck neural crest produced duck bills quail hosts transformations involved morphological changes non neural crest host beak tissues achieve changes donor neural crest cells executed autonomous molecular programs regulated gene expression adjacent host tissues thus neural crest cells source molecular information generates interspecific variation beak morphology
