small phytoplankton carbon export surface ocean
autotrophic picoplankton dominate primary production large oceanic regions believed contribute relatively little carbon export surface layers using analyses data equatorial pacific ocean arabian sea show relative direct indirect contribution picoplankton export proportional total net primary production despite small size suggest primary producers just large cells can contribute export surface layer ocean rates proportional production rates
