virulence locus pseudomonas aeruginosa encodes protein secretion apparatus
bacterial pathogens frequently use protein secretion mediate interactions hosts found virulence locus hsi-i pseudomonas aeruginosa encodes protein secretion apparatus apparatus assembled discrete subcellular locations exported hcp1 hexameric protein forms rings angstrom internal diameter regulatory patterns hsi-i suggested apparatus functions chronic infections detected hcp1 pulmonary secretions cystic fibrosis cf patients hcp1-specific antibodies sera thus hsi-i likely contributes pathogenesis p aeruginosa cf patients hsi-i-related loci widely distributed among bacterial pathogens may play general role mediating host interactions
