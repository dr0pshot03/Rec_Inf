stress-dependent regulation foxo transcription factors sirt1 deacetylase 
sir2 deacetylase modulates organismal life-span various species however molecular mechanisms sir2 increases longevity largely unknown show mammalian cells sir2 homolog sirt1 appears control cellular response stress regulating foxo family forkhead transcription factors family proteins function sensors insulin signaling pathway regulators organismal longevity sirt1 foxo transcription factor foxo3 formed complex cells response oxidative stress sirt1 deacetylated foxo3 vitro within cells sirt1 dual effect foxo3 function: sirt1 increased foxo3s ability induce cell cycle arrest resistance oxidative stress inhibited foxo3s ability induce cell death thus one way members sir2 family proteins may increase organismal longevity tipping foxo-dependent responses away apoptosis toward stress resistance
