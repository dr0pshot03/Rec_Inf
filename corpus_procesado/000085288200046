direct measurement electrical transport dna molecules 
attempts infer dna electron transfer fluorescence quenching measurements- dna strands doped donor acceptor molecules spurred intense debate question whether important biomolecule able conduct electrical charges recently first electrical transport measurements micrometre-long dna ropes also large numbers dna molecules films indicated dna behaves good linear conductor present measurements electrical transport individual -nm-long double-stranded polyg-polyc dna molecules connected two metal nanoelectrodes indicate contrast large-bandgap semiconducting behaviour obtain nonlinear current-voltage curves exhibit voltage gap low applied bias observed air well vacuum cryogenic temperatures voltage dependence differential conductance exhibits peak structure suggestive charge carrier transport mediated molecular energy bands dna
