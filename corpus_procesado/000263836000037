type ii fatty acid synthesis suitable antibiotic target gram-positive pathogens 
antimicrobial drugs targeting reportedly essential type ii fatty acid synthesis fasii pathway- recently acclaimed efficacy infections caused multiresistant gram-positive bacteria- findings show strategy antibiotic development based fasii pathway targets fundamentally flawed fact exogenous fatty acids fully bypass inhibition pathway vitro vivo conditions demonstrate major gram-positive pathogens-such streptococci pneumococci enterococci staphylococci-overcome drug-induced fasii pathway inhibition supplied exogenous fatty acids human serum proves highly effective source fatty acids opportunist pathogen streptococcus agalactiae growth serum leads overall decrease fasii gene expression antibiotic inhibitor stronger effect inactivation target gene challenged role fasii using deletion mutants results unequivocally show fasii target enzymes dispensable vivo s agalactiae infection results study largely compromise use fasii-based antimicrobials treating sepsis caused gram-positive pathogens
