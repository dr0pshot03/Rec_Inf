stable rna/dna hybrids mammalian genome: inducible intermediates immunoglobulin class switch recombination 
although well established mammalian class switch recombination responsible altering class immunoglobulins mechanistic details process remained unclear show stable rna/dna hybrids form class switch sequences mouse genome upon cytokine-specific stimulation class switch primary splenic b cells rna hybridized switch dna transcribed physiological orientation mice constitutively express escherichia coli ribonuclease h transgene show marked reduction rna/dna hybrid formation impaired ability generate serum immunoglobulin g antibodies significant inhibition class switch recombination splenic b cells data provide evidence stable rna/dna hybrids exist mammalian nuclear genome can serve intermediates physiologic: processes mechanistically important efficient class switching vivo
