efficient inhibition alzheimers disease beta-secretase membrane targeting 
beta-secretase plays critical role beta amyloid formation thus provides therapeutic target alzheimers disease inhibitor design usually focused active site binding neglecting subcellular localization active enzyme addressed issue synthesizing membrane anchored version beta secretase transition state inhibitor linking sterol moiety thus targeted inhibitor active beta secretase found endosomes also reduced dimensionality inhibitor increasing local membrane concentration inhibitor reduced enzyme activity much efficiently free inhibitor cultured cells vivo addition effectively targeting beta secretase strategy also used designing potent drugs membrane protein targets
