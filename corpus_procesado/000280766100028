mesenchymal haematopoietic stem cells form unique bone marrow niche 
cellular constituents forming haematopoietic stem cell hsc niche bone marrow unclear studies implicating osteoblasts endothelial perivascular cells demonstrate mesenchymal stem cells mscs identified using nestin expression constitute essential hsc niche component nestin+ mscs contain bone-marrow colony-forming-unit fibroblastic activity can propagated non-adherent mesenspheres can self-renew expand serial transplantations nestin+ mscs spatially associated hscs adrenergic nerve fibres highly express hsc maintenance genes genes others triggering osteoblastic differentiation selectively downregulated enforced hsc mobilization beta adrenoreceptor activation whereas parathormone administration doubles number bone marrow nestin+ cells favours osteoblastic differentiation vivo nestin+ cell depletion rapidly reduces hsc content bone marrow purified hscs home near nestin+ mscs bone marrow lethally irradiated mice whereas vivo nestin+ cell depletion significantly reduces bone marrow homing haematopoietic progenitors results uncover unprecedented partnership two distinct somatic stem-cell types indicative unique niche bone marrow made heterotypic stem-cell pairs
