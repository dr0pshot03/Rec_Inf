possible primordial peptide cycle 
alpha-amino acids can undergo peptide formation activation carbon monoxide co hot aqueous conditions presence freshly coprecipitated colloidal fenis now show co-driven peptide formation proceeds concomitantly co-driven n-terminal peptide degradation racemizing n-terminal hydantoin urea derivatives alpha-amino acids establishes peptide cycle closely related anabolic catabolic segments hydantoin derivative purin-related heterocycle fenis-dependent urea hydrolysis evolutionary precursor nickel-enzyme urease results support theory chemoautotrophic origin life co-driven fenis-dependent primordial metabolism
