interfollicular epidermal stem cells self-renew via autocrine wnt signaling
skin classical example tissue maintained stem cells however identity stem cells maintain interfollicular epidermis source signals control activity remain unclear using mouse lineage tracing quantitative clonal analyses showed wnt target gene axin2 marks interfollicular epidermal stem cells axin2-expressing cells constitute majority basal epidermal layer compete neutrally require wnt/beta-catenin signaling proliferate cells contribute robustly wound healing requirement quiescent stem cell subpopulation means double-labeling rna situ hybridization mice showed axin2-expressing cells produce wnt signals well long-range secreted wnt inhibitors suggesting autocrine mechanism stem cell self-renewal
