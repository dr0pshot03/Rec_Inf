fast core rotation red-giant stars revealed gravity-dominated mixed modes
core hydrogen exhausted stellar evolution central region star contracts outer envelope expands cools giving rise red giant convection takes place overmuch stars radius conservation angular momentum requires cores stars rotate faster envelopes indirect evidence supports information angular-momentum distribution inaccessible direct observations can extracted effect rotation oscillation modes probe stellar interior report increasing rotation rate surface star stellar core interiors red giants obtained using rotational frequency splitting recently detected mixed modes comparison theoretical stellar models conclude core must rotate least ten times faster surface observational result confirms theoretical prediction steep gradient rotation profile towards deep stellar interior
