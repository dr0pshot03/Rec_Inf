dosage compensation via transposable element mediated rewiring regulatory network 
transposable elements tes may contribute evolutionary innovations rewiring networks supplying ready-to-use cis regulatory elements genes drosophila x chromosome coordinately regulated male specific lethal msl complex achieve dosage compensation males show acquisition dozens msl binding sites evolutionarily new x chromosomes facilitated independent co-option mutant helitron te attracts msl complex te domestication recently formed neo-x recruits helitrons provide dozens functional suboptimal msl binding sites whereas older xr chromosome ceased acquisition appears fine-tuned binding affinities ancient elements msl complex thus te-mediated rewiring regulatory networks domestication amplification may followed fine-tuning cis-regulatory element supplied te erosion nonfunctional regions
