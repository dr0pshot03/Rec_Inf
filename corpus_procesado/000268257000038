partial penetrance facilitates developmental evolution bacteria 
development normally occurs similarly individuals within isogenic population mutations often affect fates individual organisms differently- phenomenon known partial penetrance observed diverse developmental systems however remains unclear underlying genetic network specifies set possible alternative fates relative frequencies fates evolve- identify stochastic cell fate determination process operates bacillus subtilis sporulation mutants show allows genetic control penetrance multiple fates mutations intercompartmental signalling process generate set discrete alternative fates observed wild-type cells including rare formation two viable twin spores rather one within single cell genetically modulating chromosome replication septation can systematically tune penetrance mutant fate furthermore signalling replication perturbations synergize significantly increase penetrance twin sporulation results suggest potential pathway developmental evolution monosporulation twin sporulation states intermediate twin penetrance furthermore time-lapse microscopy twin sporulation wild-type clostridium oceanicum shows strong resemblance twin sporulation b subtilis mutants together results suggest noise can facilitate developmental evolution enabling initial expression discrete morphological traits low penetrance allowing stabilization gradual adjustment genetic parameters
