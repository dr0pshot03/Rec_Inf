abrupt rise atmospheric co2 overestimates community response model plant-soil system 
attempts understand ecological effect increasing atmospheric co2 concentration [co2] usually involve exposing todays ecosystems expected future [co2] levels however major assumption approaches tested exposing ecosystems single step increase [ co2] will yield similar responses gradual increase several decades tested assumption mycorrhizal fungal community period six years [ co2] either increased abruptly typical [ co2] experiments gradually generations two approaches resulted different structural functional community responses increased [ co2] fungi sensitive carbon pulse abrupt [ co2] treatment resulted immediate decline fungal species richness significant change mycorrhizal functioning magnitude changes fungal diversity functioning response gradually increasing [ co2] smaller significantly different ambient [ co2] results suggest studies may overestimate community responses increasing [ co2] biota may sensitive ecosystem changes occur result abrupt increases
