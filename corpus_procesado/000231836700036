spin disorder triangular lattice
liquids crystallize solids cooling spins magnets generally form periodic order however three decades ago theoretically proposed spins triangular lattice form liquidlike disordered state low temperatures whether spin liquid stabilized geometrical frustration remained active point inquiry ever since thermodynamic neutron measurements niga2s4 rare example two-dimensional triangular lattice antiferromagnet demonstrate geometrical frustration stabilizes low-temperature spin-disordered state coherence beyond two-spin correlation length spin liquid formation may origin behavior
