independent redundant information nearby cortical neurons
primary visual cortex v1 nearby neurons tuned similar stimulus features depending manner time scale neuronal signals analyzed resulting redundancy may mitigate deleterious effects response variability estimated information rates short-time scale responses clusters six simultaneously recorded nearby neurons monkey v1 responses almost independent kept track neuron fired spike redundant summed responses cluster redundancy independent cluster size summing neuronal responses reduce variability discards potentially useful information discarded information increases cluster size
