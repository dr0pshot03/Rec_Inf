omega omega fatty acids stimulate cell membrane expansion acting syntaxin 
growth neurite processes cell body critical step neuronal development involves large increase cell membrane surface area arachidonic-acid-releasing phospholipases highly enriched nerve growth cones previously implicated neurite outgrowth cell membrane expansion achieved fusion transport organelles plasma membrane however identity molecular target arachidonic acid remained elusive show syntaxin stx3 plasma membrane protein important role growth neurites also serves direct target omega arachidonic acid using syntaxin screening assay determined dietary omega linolenic docosahexaenoic acids can efficiently substitute arachidonic acid activating syntaxin findings provide molecular basis previously established action omega omega polyunsaturated fatty acids membrane expansion growth cones represent first identification single effector molecule essential nutrients
