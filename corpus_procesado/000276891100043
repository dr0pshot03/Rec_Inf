super-resolution biomolecular crystallography low-resolution data
x-ray diffraction plays pivotal role understanding biological systems revealing atomic structures proteins nucleic acids complexes much recent interest large assemblies like ribosome crystals large assemblies often diffract weakly resolution worse angstrom need methods work low resolution macromolecular assemblies components may known high resolution whereas others unknown: current refinement methods fail require high-resolution starting structure entire complex determining structure complexes often key biological importance possible principle number independent diffraction intensities resolution better angstrom generally exceeds number degrees freedom introduce method adds specific information known homologous structures allows global local deformations homology models approach uses observation local protein structure tends conserved sequence function evolve cross-validation rfree free r-factor determines optimum deformation influence homology model test cases angstrom resolution known structures high resolution method gives significant improvements conventional refinement model monitored coordinate accuracy definition secondary structure quality electron density maps re-refinements representative set low-resolution crystal structures protein data bank find similar improvements thus structure derived low-resolution diffraction data can quality similar high-resolution structure method applicable study weakly diffracting crystals using x-ray micro-diffraction well data new x-ray light sources use homology information restricted x-ray crystallography cryo-electron microscopy: optical imaging advances subnanometre resolution can use similar tools
