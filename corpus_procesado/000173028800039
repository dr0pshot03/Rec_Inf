evolutionary speed limits inferred fossil record 
dynamics extinction diversification determine long-term effects extinction episodes rapid bursts extinction offset equally rapid bursts diversification biodiversity consequences will transient diversification rates accelerate rapidly enough pulses extinction will lead long-lasting depletion biodiversity use spectral analysis fossil record test whether diversification rates can accelerate much extinction rates short long spans geological time show although long-wavelength variability diversification rates equals exceeds extinctions diversification rates markedly less variable extinction rates wavelengths shorter roughly million years implies intrinsic speed limits constrain rapidly diversification rates can accelerate response pulses extinction
