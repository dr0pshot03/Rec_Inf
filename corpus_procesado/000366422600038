deformation-assisted fluid percolation rock salt 
deep geological storage sites nuclear waste commonly located rock salt ensure hydrological isolation groundwater low permeability static rock salt due percolation threshold however deformation may able overcome threshold allow fluid flow confirm percolation threshold static experiments synthetic salt samples x-ray microtomography analyze wells penetrating salt deposits gulf mexico observed hydrocarbon distributions rock salt require percolation occurred porosities considerably static threshold due deformation-assisted percolation therefore design nuclear waste repositories salt guard deformation-driven fluid percolation general static percolation thresholds may always limit fluid flow deforming environments
