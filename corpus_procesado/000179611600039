multiple ionization atom clusters intense soft x-rays free-electron laser 
intense radiation lasers opened many new areas research physics chemistry revolutionized optical technology far work field nonlinear processes restricted infrared visible ultraviolet light1 although progress development x-ray lasers made recently2 advent free-electron laser soft-x-ray regime nm wavelength3 new light source now available experiments intense short-wavelength radiation used obtain deeper insights structure matter free-electron sources even shorter wavelengths planned future present initial results study interaction soft x-ray radiation generated free-electron laser xe atoms clusters find whereas xe atoms become singly ionized absorption single photons absorption clusters strongly enhanced average atom large clusters absorbs ev corresponding photons suggest clusters heated electrons emitted acquiring sufficient energy clusters finally disintegrate completely coulomb explosion
