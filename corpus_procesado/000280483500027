quantifying e-coli proteome transcriptome single-molecule sensitivity single cells 
protein messenger rna mrna copy numbers vary cell cell isogenic bacterial populations however molecules often exist low copy numbers difficult detect single cells carried quantitative system-wide analyses protein mrna expression individual cells single-molecule sensitivity using newly constructed yellow fluorescent protein fusion library escherichia coli found almost protein number distributions can described gamma distribution two fitting parameters low expression levels clear physical interpretations transcription rate protein burst size high expression levels distributions dominated extrinsic noise found single cells protein mrna copy numbers given gene uncorrelated
