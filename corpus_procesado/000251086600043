requirement inositol pyrophosphates full exocytotic capacity pancreatic beta cells 
inositol pyrophosphates recognized components cellular processes regulate vesicle trafficking telomere length apoptosis observed pancreatic beta cells maintain high basal concentrations pyrophosphate diphosphoinositol pentakisphosphate insp ip inositol hexakisphosphate kinases ip6ks can generate ip overexpressed overexpression stimulated exocytosis insulin-containing granules readily releasable pool exogenously applied ip7 dose-dependently enhanced exocytosis physiological concentrations determined ip6k1 ip6k2 present b cells rna silencing ip6k1 ip6k2 inhibited exocytosis suggests ip6k1 critical endogenous kinase maintenance high concentrations ip pancreatic b cell may enhance immediate exocytotic capacity consequently allow rapid adjustment insulin secretion response increased demand
