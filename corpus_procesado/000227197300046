obligate role anti-apoptotic mcl survival hematopoietic stem cells
apoptosis important controlling hematopoietic stem cell hsc numbers however specific bcl family members regulate hsc homeostasis precisely defined tested myeloid leukemia mcl- attractive candidate highly expressed hscs regulated growth factor signals inducible deletion mcl mice resulted ablation bone marrow resulted loss early bone marrow progenitor populations including hscs moreover growth factors including stem cell factor increased transcription mcl gene required mcl augment survival purified bone marrow progenitors deletion mcl tissues including liver impair survival thus mcl critical specific regulator essential ensuring homeostasis early hematopoietic progenitors
