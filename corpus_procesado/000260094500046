surface sites engineering allosteric control proteins 
statistical analyses protein families reveal networks coevolving amino acids functionally link distantly positioned functional surfaces linkages suggest concept engineering allosteric control proteins: intramolecular networks two proteins joined across surface sites activity one protein might control activity tested idea creating pas-dhfr designed chimeric protein connects light-sensing signaling domain plant member per/arnt/sim pas family proteins escherichia coli dihydrofolate reductase dhfr optimization pas-dhfr exhibited light-dependent catalytic activity depended site connection known signaling mechanisms proteins pas-dhfr serves proof concept engineering regulatory activities proteins interface design conserved allosteric sites
