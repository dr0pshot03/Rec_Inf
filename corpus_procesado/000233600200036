structured water molecules near redox cofactors found recently accelerate electron-transfer et kinetics several systems theoretical study interprotein electron transfer across aqueous interface reveals three distinctive electronic coupling mechanisms describe here: protein-mediated regime two proteins van der waals contact ii structured water-mediated regime featuring anomalously weak distance decay relatively close protein-protein contact distances iii bulk water-mediated regime large distances analysis explains range otherwise puzzling biological et kinetic data provides framework including explicit water-mediated tunneling effects et kinetics
