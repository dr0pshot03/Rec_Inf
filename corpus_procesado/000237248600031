regular period saturns magnetic field may track internal rotation 
rotation rate planet one fundamental properties saturns rotation however difficult determine solid surface time alternative clock-the magnetic field-is nearly symmetrically aligned rotation axis- radio emissions thought provide proxy measure rotation magnetic field yielded estimates rotation period h min s h min s refs period determined radio measurements exhibits large time variations even time-scales months uncertain whether radio-emission periodicity coincides inner rotation rate planet report magnetic field measurements revealed time-stationary magnetic signal period h min s +/ s signal appears stable period amplitude phase months observations pointing close connection conductive region inside planet although interpretation true inner rotation period still uncertain
