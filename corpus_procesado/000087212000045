slow differential rotation earths inner core indicated temporal changes scattering
finding earths inner core might rotating faster mantle important implications understanding core processes including generation earths magnetic field reported signal subtle-a change s per year separation two seismic waves differing paths core subsequent studies data generally supported conclusion differential rotation exists- difficulty accurately locating historic earthquakes possible biases induced strong lateral variations structure near core-mantle boundary raised doubt regarding proposed inner-core motion also study free oscillations constrained motion relatively small compared previous estimates proposed interaction inner-core boundary topography mantle heterogeneity might lock inner core mantle recent detection seismic waves scattered inner core suggests simple test inner-core motion compare scattered waves recorded montana usa two closely located nuclear tests novaya zemlya ussr data show small coherent changes scattering point toward inner-core differential rotation rate degrees per year-consistent constraints imposed free-oscillation data
