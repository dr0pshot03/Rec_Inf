flowering arabidopsis regulated daylength-dependent pathway accelerates flowering long days daylength-independent pathway ensures flowering absence inductive conditions- pathways genetically separable mutations delay flowering long short days conversely mutations block synthesis hormone gibberellin abolish flowering short days minor effect long days third pathway autonomous pathway probably acts modulating two pathways understanding pathways integrated prerequisite understanding similar environmental endogenous cues can elicit opposite flowering responses different plants arabidopsis floral induction leads ultimately upregulation floral meristem-identity genes leafy- indicating floral inductive signals integrated upstream leafy show gibberellins activate leafy promoter cis elements different sufficient daylength response demonstrating leafy promoter integrates environmental endogenous signals controlling flowering time
