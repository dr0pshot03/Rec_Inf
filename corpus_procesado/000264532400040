electromotive force huge magnetoresistance magnetic tunnel junctions 
electromotive force emf predicted faradays law reflects forces acting charge e electron moving device circuit proportional time derivative magnetic field conventional emf usually absent stationary circuits static magnetic fields also forces act spin electron recently predicted circuits part composed ferromagnetic materials arises emf spin origin even static magnetic field emf can attributed time-varying magnetization host material motion magnetic domains static magnetic field reflects conversion magnetic electrical energy show emf can indeed induced static magnetic field magnetic tunnel junctions containing zinc-blende-structured mnas quantum nanomagnets observed emf operates timescale approximately - seconds results conversion magnetic energy superparamagnetic mnas nanomagnets electrical energy magnets undergo magnetic quantum tunnelling consequence huge magnetoresistance per cent observed certain bias voltages results strongly support contention magnetic nanostructures faradays law induction must generalized account forces purely spin origin huge magnetoresistance emf may find potential applications high sensitivity magnetic sensors well new active devices spin batteries
