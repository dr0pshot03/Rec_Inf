peptides enhance magnesium signature calcite: insights origins vital effects
studies relating magnesium mg content calcified skeletons temperature often report unexplained deviations signature expected inorganically grown calcite vital effects believed biological origins mechanistic bases measured offsets remain unclear show simple hydrophilic peptide carboxyl rich character macromolecules isolated sites calcification increases calcite mg content mole percent comparisons previous studies correlating mg content carbonate minerals temperature show mg enhancement due peptides results offsets equivalent degrees degrees c insights also provide physical basis anecdotal evidence organic chemistry modulates mineralization inorganic carbonates suggest approach tuning impurity levels controlled materials synthesis
