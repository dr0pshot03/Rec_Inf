structural basis na+ transport mechanism light-driven na+ pump
krokinobacter eikastus rhodopsin kr2 first light-driven na+ pump discovered viewed potential next-generation optogenetics tool since positively charged schiff base proton located within ion-conducting pathway light-driven ion pumps thought prohibit transport non-proton cation discovery kr2 raised question achieves na+ transport present crystal structures kr2 neutral acidic conditions represent resting m-like intermediate states respectively structural spectroscopic analyses revealed gating mechanism whereby flipping asp116 sequesters schiff base proton conducting pathway facilitate na+ transport together structure-based engineering first light-driven k1 pumps electrophysiological assays mammalian neurons behavioural assays nematode studies reveal molecular basis light-driven non-proton cation pumps thus provide framework may advance development next-generation optogenetics
