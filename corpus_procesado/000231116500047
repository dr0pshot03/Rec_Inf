gating charge displacement voltage-gated ion channels involves limited transmembrane movement 
voltage-gated ion channels responsible generating electrical impulses nerves excitable cells fourth transmembrane helix s4 voltage-gated channels primary voltage-sensing unit mediates response changing membrane electric field molecular mechanism voltage sensing particularly respect magnitude transmembrane movement s4 remains controversial- determine extent transmembrane movement use fluorescent resonance energy transfer s4 domain reference point lipid bilayer lipophilic ion dipicrylamine distributes either side lipid bilayer depending membrane potential used resonance-energy-transfer acceptor donor molecules attached several positions shaker k+ channel voltage-driven transmembrane movement donor produce transient fluorescence change acceptor also translocates function voltage shaker k+ channels transient fluorescence observed indicating s4 segment translocate across lipid bilayer based observations propose molecular model voltage gating can account observed 13e gating charge limited transmembrane s4 movement
