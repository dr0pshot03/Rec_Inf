de novo protein crystal structure determination x-ray free-electron laser data 
determination protein crystal structures hampered need macroscopic crystals x-ray free-electron lasers fels provide extremely intense pulses femtosecond duration allow data collection nanometre micrometre-sized crystals- diffraction-before-destruction approach far protein structure determinations carried using fels based previous knowledge related known structures- show x-ray fel data can used de novo protein structure determination without previous knowledge structure using emerging technique serial femtosecond crystallography- performed single-wavelength anomalous scattering measurements microcrystals well-established model system lysozyme complex lanthanide compound using monte-carlo integration obtained high-quality diffraction intensities experimental phases determined resulting experimental electron density map good enough automated building protein structure demonstrates feasibility determining novel protein structures using fels anticipate serial femtosecond crystallography will become important tool structure determination proteins difficult crystallize membrane proteins
