hox protein mutation macroevolution insect body plan 
fascinating question biology molecular changes developmental pathways lead macroevolutionary changes morphology mutations homeotic hox genes long suggested potential causes morphological evolution abundant evidence changes hox expression patterns correlate transitions animal axial pattern major morphological transition metazoans occurred million years ago six-legged insects diverged crustacean-like arthropod ancestors multiple limbs- drosophila melanogaster insects ultrabithorax ubx abdominal abda also abd-a hox proteins expressed largely abdominal segments can suppress thoracic leg development embryogenesis branchiopod crustacean ubx/abda proteins expressed thorax abdomen including limb primordia repress limbs- previous studies led us propose gain loss transcriptional activation repression functions hox proteins plausible mechanism diversify morphology animal evolution show naturally selected alteration ubx protein linked evolutionary transition hexapod limb pattern
