phosphorylation autophagy receptor optineurin restricts salmonella growth 
selective autophagy can mediated via receptor molecules link specific cargoes autophagosomal membranes decorated ubiquitin-like microtubule-associated protein light chain lc3 modifiers although several autophagy receptors identified little known mechanisms controlling functions vivo work found phosphorylation autophagy receptor optineurin promoted selective autophagy ubiquitin-coated cytosolic salmonella enterica protein kinase tank binding kinase tbk1 phosphorylated optineurin serine- enhancing lc3 binding affinity autophagic clearance cytosolic salmonella conversely ubiquitin-or lc3-binding optineurin mutants silencing optineurin tbk1 impaired salmonella autophagy resulting increased intracellular bacterial proliferation propose phosphorylation autophagy receptors might general mechanism regulation cargo-selective autophagy
