origin dramatic oxygen solute strengthening effect titanium
structural alloys often strengthened addition solute atoms however given solute atoms interact weakly elastic fields screw dislocations long accepted solution hardening marginally effective materials mobile screw dislocations using transmission electron microscopy nanomechanical characterization report intense hardening effect dilute oxygen solutes pure a-ti due interaction oxygen core screw dislocations mainly glide prismatic planes first-principles calculations reveal distortion interstitial sites screw dislocation core creates strong short-range repulsion oxygen consistent experimental observations results establish highly effective mechanism strengthening interstitial solutes
