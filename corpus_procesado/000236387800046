critical role innate immune signaling molecule irak- t cell activation 
irak- protein kinase pivotal mediating signals innate immune responses report irak- signaling also essential eliciting adaptive immune responses thus absence irak- vivo t cell responses significantly impaired upon t cell receptor stimulation irak- recruited t cell lipid rafts induces downstream signals including protein kinase c theta activation association zap70 signaling pathway found required optimal activation nuclear factor kappa b findings suggest t cells use critical regulator innate immunity development acquired immunity suggesting irak- may involved direct signal cross talk two systems
