evidence ecological speciation alternative
natural selection commonly drives origin species darwin initially claimed mechanisms speciation selection fall two broad categories: ecological mutation order ecological speciation divergence driven divergent natural selection environments whereas mutation order speciation divergence occurs different mutations arise fixed separate populations adapting similar selection pressures tests parallel evolution reproductive isolation trait based assortative mating reproductive isolation active selection demonstrated ecological speciation common means new species arise evidence mutation order speciation natural selection limited best documented instances reproductive isolation resulting intragenomic conflict however still identified aspects selection identifying underlying genes reproductive isolation remains challenging
