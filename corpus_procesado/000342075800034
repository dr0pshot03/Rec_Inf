early turbulent mixing origin chemical homogeneity open star clusters 
abundances elements stars critical clues stars origins observed star-to-star variations logarithmic abundance within open star cluster-a gravitationally bound ensemble stars galactic plane-are typically many elements- noticeably smaller variation seen interstellar medium stars form- unknown star clusters homogenous whether homogeneity also prevail regions lower star formation efficiency produce bound clusters report simulations trace mixing chemical elements star-forming clouds assemble collapse show turbulent mixing cloud assembly naturally produces stellar abundance scatter least five times smaller gas sufficient explain observed chemical homogeneity stars moreover mixing occurs early regions star formation efficiencies per cent nearly well mixed formation efficiencies per cent implies even regions form bound clusters likely well mixed improves prospects using chemical tagging reconstruct via unique chemical signatures tags star clusters whose constituent stars become unbound one another spread across galactic disk
