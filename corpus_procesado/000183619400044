low-density m-type asteroid main belt
orbital parameters satellite revolving around kalliope indicate bulk density main-belt asteroid +/ grams per cubic centimeter m-type asteroids kalliope thought disrupted metallic cores differentiated bodies low density indicates kalliope predominantly composed metal may composed chondritic material similar to30% porosity satellite orbit circular suggesting kalliope satellite different internal structures tidal dissipation rates satellite may aggregate impact ejecta earlier collision kalliope
