evolutionarily conserved bmp-binding protein twisted gastrulation promotes bmp signalling
dorsal-ventral patterning vertebrate drosophila embryos requires conserved system extracellular proteins generate positional information gradient components involved include bone morphogenetic proteins bmp/dpp bmp antagonist chordin/short gastrulation chd/sog secreted metalloproteinase xolloid/tolloid cleaves chd/sog describe xenopus twisted gastrulation xtsg another member signalling pathway xtsg expressed ventrally part bmp synexpression group encodes secreted bmp-binding protein bmp signalling agonist data suggest molecular mechanism xtsg dislodges latent bmps bound chordin bmp-binding fragments generated xolloid cleavage providing permissive signal allows high bmp signalling embryo drosophila tsg also binds bmps expressed dorsally supporting proposal dorsal-ventral axis inverted course animal evolution
