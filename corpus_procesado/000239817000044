p53-mediated inhibition angiogenesis up-regulation collagen prolyl hydroxylase
recent evidence suggests antiangiogenic therapy sensitive p53 status tumors implicating role p53 regulation angiogenesis show p53 transcriptionally activates alphaii collagen prolyl--hydroxylase [alphaii ph] gene resulting extracellular release antiangiogenic fragments collagen type conditioned media cells ectopically expressing either p53 alphaii ph selectively inhibited growth primary human endothelial cells expressed intracellularly exogenously delivered alphaii ph significantly inhibited tumor growth mice results reveal genetic biochemical linkage p53 tumor suppressor pathway synthesis antiangiogenic collagen fragments
