evolution virulence plant host-pathogen metapopulation 
wild plant-pathogen system host resistance pathogen virulence varied markedly among local populations broadly virulent pathogens occurred frequently highly resistant host populations whereas avirulent pathogens dominated susceptible populations experimental inoculations indicated negative trade-off spore production virulence nonrandom spatial distribution pathogens maintained time despite high pathogen mobility implies selection favors virulent strains melampsora lini resistant linum marginale populations avirulent strains susceptible populations results consistent gene-for-gene models host-pathogen coevolution require trade-offs prevent pathogen virulence increasing host resistance becomes selectively neutral
