liquid crystal phase transitions suspensions polydisperse plate-like particles
colloidal suspensions form periodic self-assembling structures sub-micrometre scales potential technological interest example three-dimensional arrangements spheres colloidal crystals might serve photonic materials intended manipulate light colloidal particles non-spherical shapes rods plates particular interest ability form liquid crystals nematic liquid crystals possess orientational order smectic columnar liquid crystals additionally exhibit positional order one two dimensions respectively however positional ordering may inhibited polydisperse colloidal suspensions describe suspension plate-like colloids shows isotropic nematic columnar phases increasing particle concentration find columnar two-dimensional crystal persists polydispersity % cross-over smectic-like ordering high particle concentrations results imply liquid crystalline order synthetic mesoscopic materials may easier achieve previously thought
