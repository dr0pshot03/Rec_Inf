designed divergent evolution enzyme function 
generally believed proteins promiscuous functions divergently evolved acquire higher specificity activity1- process highly dependent ability proteins alter functions small number amino acid substitutions plasticity6 application theory divergent molecular evolution promiscuous enzymes may allow us design enzymes specificity higher activity many structural biochemical analyses identified active binding site residues important functional plasticity plasticity residues6- understand residues contribute molecular evolution thereby formulate design methodology plasticity residues probed active site promiscuous sesquiterpene synthase gamma-humulene synthase1112 identified plasticity residues systematically recombined based mathematical model order construct novel terpene synthases catalysing synthesis one different sesquiterpenes present construction seven specific active synthases use different reaction pathways produce specific different products creation enzymes demonstrates feasibility exploiting underlying evolvability scaffold provides evidence rational approaches based ideas useful enzyme design
