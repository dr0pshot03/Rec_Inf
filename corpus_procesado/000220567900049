rapid rewiring arcuate nucleus feeding circuits leptin 
fat-derived hormone leptin regulates energy balance part modulating activity neuropeptide y proopiomelanocortin neurons hypothalamic arcuate nucleus study intrinsic activity neurons responses leptin generated mice express distinct green fluorescent proteins two neuronal types leptin-deficient ob/ob mice differed wild-type mice numbers excitatory inhibitory synapses postsynaptic currents onto neuropeptide y proopiomelanocortin neurons leptin delivered systemically ob/ob mice synaptic density rapidly normalized effect detectable within hours several hours leptins effect food intake data suggest leptin-mediated plasticity ob/ob hypothalamus may underlie hormones behavioral effects
