internalization salmonella macrophages induces formation nonreplicating persisters 
many bacterial pathogens cause persistent infections despite repeated antibiotic exposure bacterial persisters antibiotic-tolerant cells little known growth status signals pathways leading formation infected tissues used fluorescent single-cell analysis identify salmonella persisters infection part nonreplicating population formed immediately uptake macrophages induced vacuolar acidification nutritional deprivation conditions also induce salmonella virulence gene expression majority toxin-antitoxin modules contributed intracellular persister formation persisters resumed intracellular growth phagocytosis naive macrophages thus vacuolar environment induces phenotypic heterogeneity leading either bacterial replication formation nonreplicating persisters provide reservoir relapsing infection
