cellular basis gabab-mediated interhemispheric inhibition
interhemispheric inhibition thought mediate cortical rivalry two hemispheres callosal input long-lasting form inhibition believed operate via gamma-aminobutyric acid type b gabab receptors process poorly understood cellular level found firing layer pyramidal neurons rat somatosensory cortex due contralateral sensory stimulation inhibited hundreds milliseconds paired ipsilateral stimulation inhibition acted directly apical dendrites via layer interneurons silent absence pyramidal cell firing relying metabotropic inhibition active dendritic currents recruited neuronal activity results reveal microcircuitry underlying interhemispheric inhibition also demonstrate importance active dendritic properties cortical output
