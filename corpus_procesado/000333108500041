ecological opportunities promote population divergence coexisting lineages however genetic mechanisms enable new lineages exploit opportunities poorly understood except cases single mutations examined two escherichia coli lineages diverged common ancestor outset long-term coexistence sequencing genomes reconstructing genetic history one lineage showed three mutations together sufficient produce frequency-dependent fitness effects allowed lineage invade stably coexist mutations affected regulatory genes collectively caused substantial metabolic changes moreover particular derived alleles critical initial divergence invasion indicating establishment polymorphism depended specific epistatic interactions
