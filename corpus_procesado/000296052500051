transgenerational epigenetic instability source novel methylation variants 
epigenetic information may affect organisms phenotype can stored stably inherited form cytosine dna methylation changes dna methylation can produce meiotically stable epialleles affect transcription morphology rates spontaneous gain loss dna methylation unknown examined spontaneously occurring variation dna methylation arabidopsis thaliana plants propagated single-seed descent generations identified cg single methylation polymorphisms cg differentially methylated regions dmrs show patterns divergence compared ancestral state thus transgenerational epigenetic variation dna methylation may generate new allelic states alter transcription providing mechanism phenotypic diversity absence genetic mutation
