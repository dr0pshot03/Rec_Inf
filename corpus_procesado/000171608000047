bacteriophage phi portal motor can package dna large internal force 
part viral infection cycle viruses must package newly replicated genomes delivery host cells bacteriophage phi packages -mum long double-stranded dna 42x54 nm capsid means portal complex hydrolyses atp process remarkable entropic electrostatic bending energies dna must overcome package dna near-crystalline density use optical tweezers pull single dna molecules packaged thus demonstrating portal complex force-generating motor motor can work loads pn average making one strongest molecular motors reported date movements mum observed indicating high processivity pauses slips also occur particularly higher forces establish force-velocity relationship motor find rate-limiting step motors cycle force dependent even low loads notably packaging rate decreases prohead filled indicating internal force builds similar pn owing dna confinement data suggest force may available initiating ejection dna capsid infection
