asymmetric hydrogenation unfunctionalized purely alkyl-substituted olefins
asymmetric hydrogenation olefins one useful reactions synthesis optically active compounds especially industry however application range catalysts developed far limited alkenes coordinating functional group aryl substituent next double bond found class chiral iridium catalysts give high enantioselectivity hydrogenation unfunctionalized trialkyl-substituted olefins catalysts require presence particular functional group aryl substituent substrate considerably broaden scope asymmetric hydrogenation
