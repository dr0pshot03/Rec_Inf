ca2+ regulates t-cell receptor activation modulating charge property lipids
ionic protein-lipid interactions critical structure function membrane receptors ion channels integrins many proteins- however regulatory mechanism interactions largely unknown show ca2+ can bind directly anionic phospholipids thus modulate membrane protein function activation t-cell antigen receptor-cd3 complex tcr key membrane receptor adaptive immunity regulated ionic interactions positively charged cd3 epsilon/zeta cytoplasmic domains cd3cd negatively charged phospholipids plasma membrane- crucial tyrosines buried membrane largely protected phosphorylation resting t cells clear cd3cd dissociates membrane antigen-stimulated t cells antigen engagement even single tcr triggers ca2+ influx tcr-proximal ca2+ concentration higher average cytosolic ca2+ concentration biochemical live-cell fluorescence resonance energy transfer nmr experiments showed increase ca2+ concentration induced dissociation cd3cd membrane solvent exposure tyrosine residues consequence cd3 tyrosine phosphorylation significantly enhanced ca2+ influx moreover compared wild-type cells ca2+ channel-deficient t cells substantially lower levels cd3 phosphorylation stimulation effect ca2+ facilitating cd3 phosphorylation primarily due charge ion demonstrated fact replacing ca2+ non-physiological ion sr2+ resulted feedback effect finally p nmr spectroscopy showed ca2+ bound phosphate group anionic phospholipids physiological concentrations thus neutralizing negative charge phospholipids rather initiating cd3 phosphorylation regulatory pathway ca2+ positive feedback effect amplifying sustaining cd3 phosphorylation enhance t-cell sensitivity foreign antigens study thus provides new regulatory mechanism ca2+ t-cell activation involving direct lipid manipulation
