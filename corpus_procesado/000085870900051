inhibitory threshold critical-period activation primary visual cortex 
neuronal circuits across several systems display remarkable plasticity sensory input postnatal development- experience-dependent refinements often restricted well-defined critical periods early life established remains mostly unknown representative example loss responsiveness neocortex eye deprived vision- show potential plasticity retained throughout life inhibitory threshold attained mice ages lacking isoform gaba gamma-aminobutyric acid synthetic enzyme gad65 well immature wild-type animals onset natural critical period benzodiazepines selectively reduced prolonged discharge phenotype unmask plasticity enhancing gaba-mediated transmission early life rendered mutant animals insensitive monocular deprivation adults similar normal wild-type mice short-term presynaptic dynamics reflected synaptic reorganization gad65 knockout mice chronic diazepam treatment threshold level inhibition within visual cortex may thus trigger life experience-dependent critical period circuit consolidation may otherwise lie dormant
