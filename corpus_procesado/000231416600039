much mass meteoroids entering earths atmosphere consumed process ablation larger meteoroids > cm cases reach ground meteorites typically survival fractions near per cent initial mass fate remaining ablated material unclear theory suggests much recondense coagulation nanometre-sized particles direct measurements meteoric smoke hitherto made report disintegration one largest meteoroids entered earths atmosphere past decade show dominant contribution mass residual atmospheric aerosol form micrometre-sized particles result contrary usual view material large meteoroids efficiently converted particles much smaller size ablation assuming observations typical event suggest large meteoroids provide dominant source micrometre-sized meteoritic dust earths surface long timescales
