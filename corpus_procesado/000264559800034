reversible interactions para-hydrogen enhance nmr sensitivity polarization transfer 
sensitivity nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy magnetic resonance imaging low detected signal strength depends small population difference spin states even high magnetic fields hyperpolarization methods can used increase difference thereby enhance signal strength achieved previously incorporating molecular spin singlet para-hydrogen hydrogenation reaction products show metal complex can facilitate reversible interaction para-hydrogen suitable organic substrate -fold increase proton carbon nitrogen signal strengths seen substrate without hydrogenation polarized signals can selectively detected combined methods suppress background signals
