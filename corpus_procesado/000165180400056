genetic pathways regulate ageing model organisms 
searches genes involved ageing process made genetically tractable model organisms yeast nematode caenorhabditis elegans drosophila melanogaster fruitflies mice genetic studies established ageing indeed regulated specific genes allowed analysis pathways involved linking physiology signal transduction gene regulation intriguing similarities phenotypes many mutants indicate mutations may also perturb regulatory systems control ageing higher organisms
