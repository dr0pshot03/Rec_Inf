red-green colour blindness results absence either long-l middle m wavelength-sensitive visual photopigments common single locus genetic disorder explore possibility curing colour blindness using gene therapy experiments adult monkeys colour blind since birth third type cone pigment added dichromatic retinas providing receptoral basis trichromatic colour vision opened new avenue explore requirements establishing neural circuits new dimension colour sensation classic visual deprivation experiments led expectation neural connections established development appropriately process input present birth therefore believed treatment congenital vision disorders ineffective unless administered young however show addition third opsin adult red-green colour deficient primates sufficient produce trichromatic colour vision behaviour thus trichromacy can arise single addition third cone class require early developmental process provides positive outlook potential gene therapy cure adult vision disorders
