genetic ablation reveals roof plate essential dorsal interneuron specification 
neural development vertebrates spatially ordered array neurons generated response inductive signals derived localized organizing centres one organizing centre proposed role control neural patterning roof plate define contribution signals derived roof plate specification neuronal cell types dorsal neural tube devised genetic strategy ablate roof plate selectively mouse embryos embryos without roof plate lack interneuron subtypes normally generated dorsal third neural tube using genetically based lineage analysis vitro assays show loss neurons results elimination nonautonomous signals provided roof plate results reveal roof plate essential specifying multiple classes neurons mammalian central nervous system
