measurement process plays awkward role quantum mechanics measurement forces system choose possible outcomes fundamentally unpredictable manner therefore hidden classical processes considered possibly predetermining measurement outcomes preserving statistical distributions however quantitative measure can distinguish classically determined correlations stronger quantum correlations exists form bell inequalities measurements provide strong experimental evidence quantum mechanics provides complete description- demonstrate violation bell inequality solid-state system use pair josephson phase qubits- acting spin-/ particles show qubits can entangled measured violate clauser-horne-shimony-holt chsh version bell inequality measure bell signal +/ exceeding maximum amplitude classical system standard deviations experiment deterministically generate entangled state measure qubits single-shot manner closing detection loophole bell inequality designed test non-classical behaviour without assuming applicability quantum mechanics system question experiment provides strong evidence macroscopic electrical circuit really quantum system
