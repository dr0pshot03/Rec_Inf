increasing hyperpolarized spin lifetimes true singlet eigenstates 
sensitivity limitations magnetic resonance imaging organic molecules recently addressed hyperpolarization methods prepare excess nuclear spin polarization approach can increase sensitivity orders magnitude enhanced signal relaxes away tens seconds even favorable cases show theoretically singlet states strongly coupled spins molecules can used store retrieve population very-long-lived disconnected eigenstates long coupling spins substantially exceeds couplings spins resonance frequency difference experimentally -carbon--labeled diacetyl disconnected eigenstate can store population minutes read hydration make two spins inequivalent
