centrosome misorientation reduces stem cell division ageing 
asymmetric division adult stem cells generates one self renewing stem cell one differentiating cell thereby maintaining tissue homeostasis decline stem cell function proposed contribute tissue ageing although underlying mechanism poorly understood show changes stem cell orientation respect niche ageing contribute decline spermatogenesis male germ line drosophila throughout cell cycle centrosomes germline stem cells gscs oriented within niche ensures asymmetric division found gscs containing misoriented centrosomes accumulate age gscs arrested delayed cell cycle cell cycle arrest transient gscs appear re enter cell cycle correction centrosome orientation basis findings propose cell cycle arrest associated centrosome misorientation functions mechanism ensure asymmetric stem cell division inability stem cells maintain correct orientation ageing contributes decline spermatogenesis also show misoriented gscs probably originate dedifferentiation spermatogonia
