direct stereospecific synthesis unprotected n-h n-me aziridines olefins 
despite prevalence n-h aziridine motif bioactive natural products clear advantages unprotected parent structure n-protected derivatives synthetic building block practical methods emerged direct synthesis compound class unfunctionalized olefins present mild versatile method direct stereospecific conversion structurally diverse mono- di- tri- tetrasubstituted olefins n-h aziridines using o--dinitrophenylhydroxylamine dph via homogeneous rhodium catalysis external oxidants method operationally simple ie one-pot scalable fast ambient temperature furnishing n-h aziridines good-to-excellent yields likewise n-alkyl aziridines prepared n-alkylated dph derivatives quantum-mechanical calculations suggest plausible rh-nitrene pathway
