interaction-based quantum metrology showing scaling beyond heisenberg limit 
quantum metrology aims use entanglement quantum resources improve precision measurement interferometer using n independent particles measure parameter x can achieve best standard quantum limit sensitivity delta x proportional n-/ however using n entangled particles exotic states interferometer can principle achieve heisenberg limit delta x proportional n- recent theoretical work- argued interactions among particles may valuable resource quantum metrology allowing scaling beyond heisenberg limit specifically k-particle interaction will produce sensitivity delta x proportional n-k appropriate entangled states delta x proportional n-k-/ even without entanglement demonstrate super-heisenberg scaling delta x proportional n-/ nonlinear non-destructive measurement magnetization atomic ensemble use fast optical nonlinearities generate pairwise photon-photon interaction corresponding k preserving quantum-noise-limited performance observe super-heisenberg scaling two orders magnitude n limited large numbers higher order nonlinear effects good agreement theory measurement limited duration super-heisenberg scaling allows nonlinear measurement overtake sensitivity comparable linear measurement number photons situations however higher-order nonlinearities prevent crossover occurring reflecting subtle relationship scaling sensitivity nonlinear systems work shows interparticle interactions can improve sensitivity quantum-limited measurement experimentally demonstrates new resource quantum metrology
