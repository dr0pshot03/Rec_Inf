evolution human bcr-abl1 lymphoblastic leukaemia-initiating cells
many tumours composed genetically diverse cells however little known diversity evolves impact diversity functional properties using xenografting dna copy number alteration cna profiling human bcr-abl1 lymphoblastic leukaemia demonstrate genetic diversity occurs functionally defined leukaemia-initiating cells many diagnostic patient samples contain multiple genetically distinct leukaemia-initiating cell subclones reconstructing subclonal genetic ancestry several samples cna profiling demonstrated branching multi-clonal evolution model leukaemogenesis rather linear succession patient samples predominant diagnostic clone repopulated xenografts whereas others outcompeted minor subclones reconstitution predominant diagnosis clone associated aggressive growth properties xenografts deletion cdkn2a cdkn2b trend towards poorer patient outcome findings link clonal diversity leukaemia-initiating-cell function underscore importance developing therapies eradicate intratumoral subclones
