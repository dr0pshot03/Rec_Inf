isotopic evidence microbial sulphate reduction early archaean era
sulphate-reducing microbes affect modern sulphur cycle may quite ancient though evolved uncertain organisms produce sulphide oxidizing organic matter hydrogen sulphate sulphate concentrations greater mm sulphides isotopically fractionated depleted s- parts per thousand compared sulphate fractionations decreasing near parts per thousand lower concentrations- isotope record sedimentary sulphides shows large fractionations relative seawater sulphate gyr ago indicating microbial sulphate reduction older rocks however much smaller fractionations equivocal origin possibly biogenic also possibly volcanogenic- report microscopic sulphides similar to3-gyr-old barites north pole australia maximum fractionations parts per thousand mean parts per thousand clearly indicating microbial sulphate reduction results extend geological record microbial sulphate reduction back million years represent direct evidence early specific metabolic pathway-allowing time calibration deep node tree life
