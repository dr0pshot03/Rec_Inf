attentional modulation visual cortex depends task timing 
paying attention stimulus selectively increases ability process example subjects attend specific region visual scene sensitivity changes location increases large number studies describe behavioural consequences neurophysiological correlates attending spatial locations- contrast little study allocation attention time subjects can anticipate predictable events great temporal precision- seems probable might dynamically shift attention performing familiar perceptual task whose constraints changed time trained monkeys respond stimulus change probability occurrence changed time recording area v4 visual cortex animals found modulation neuronal responses changed according probability change occurring instant thus show attentional modulation sensory neurons reflects subjects anticipation timing behaviourally relevant events
