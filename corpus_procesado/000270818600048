packing granular polymer chains 
rigid particles pack structures sand dunes beach whose overall stability determined average number contacts particles however packing spatially extended objects flexible shapes additional concepts must invoked understand stability resulting structure examine disordered packing chains constructed flexibly connected hard spheres using x-ray tomography find long chains pack low-density structure whose mechanical rigidity mainly provided backbone compaction randomly oriented semi-rigid loops form along chain packing chains can understood jamming elements finally uncover close similarities packing chains glass transition polymers
