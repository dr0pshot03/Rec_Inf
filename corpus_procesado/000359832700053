structures rna polymerase-sigma reveal new conserved regulatory strategies 
transcription rna polymerase rnap bacteria requires specific promoter recognition sigma factors major variant s factor sigma initially forms transcriptionally silent complex requiring specialized adenosine triphosphate-dependent activators initiation crystal structure kilodalton rnap-sigma holoenzyme angstroms reveals molecular details sigma interactions rnap structure explains sigma targets different regions rnap exert inhibitory function although sigma major s factor sigma similar functional domains contact similar regions rnap unanticipated differences observed domain arrangement interactions rnap explaining distinct properties furthermore observe evolutionarily conserved regulatory hotspots rnaps can targeted diverse range mechanisms fine tune transcription
