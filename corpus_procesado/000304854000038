preferential electrical coupling regulates neocortical lineage-dependent microcircuit assembly
radial glial cells primary neural progenitor cells developing neocortex consecutive asymmetric divisions individual radial glial progenitor cells produce number sister excitatory neurons migrate along elongated radial glial fibre resulting formation ontogenetic columns- moreover sister excitatory neurons ontogenetic columns preferentially develop specific chemical synapses rather nearby non-siblings although findings provide crucial insight emergence functional columns neocortex little known basis lineage-dependent assembly excitatory neuron microcircuits single-cell resolution show transient electrical coupling radially aligned sister excitatory neurons regulates subsequent formation specific chemical synapses neocortex multiple-electrode whole-cell recordings showed sister excitatory neurons preferentially form strong electrical coupling rather adjacent non-sister excitatory neurons early postnatal stages preferential coupling allows selective electrical communication sister excitatory neurons promoting action potential generation synchronous firing interestingly although electrical communication largely disappears appearance chemical synapses blockade electrical communication impairs subsequent formation specific chemical synapses sister excitatory neurons ontogenetic columns results suggest strong link lineage-dependent transient electrical coupling assembly precise excitatory neuron microcircuits neocortex
