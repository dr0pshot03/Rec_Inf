supercooled liquids glass transition
glasses disordered materials lack periodicity crystals behave mechanically like solids common way making glass cooling viscous liquid fast enough avoid crystallization although route vitreous state supercooling known millennia molecular processes liquids acquire amorphous rigidity upon cooling fully understood discuss current theoretical knowledge manner intermolecular forces give rise complex behaviour supercooled liquids glasses intriguing aspect behaviour apparent connection dynamics thermodynamics multidimensional potential energy surface function particle coordinates energy landscape offers convenient viewpoint analysis interpretation supercooling glass-formation phenomena much analysis present largely qualitative reflects fact precise computations viscous liquids sample landscape become possible recently
