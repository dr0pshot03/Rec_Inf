drought snails large-scale die-off southern us salt marshes
salt marshes southeastern united states recently experienced massive die-off one many examples widespread degradation marine coastal ecosystems although intense drought thought primary cause die-off found snail grazing major contributing factor survey marsh die-off areas three states revealed high-density fronts snails dieoff edges sites exclusion experiments demonstrated snails actively converted marshes exposed mudflats salt addition comparative field studies suggest drought-induced stress grazers acted synergistically varying degrees cause initial plant death disturbances snail fronts formed die-off edges subsequently propagated healthy marsh leading cascading vegetation loss results combined model analyses reveal strong interactions increasing climatic stress grazer pressure potentially related human environmental impacts amplify likelihood intensity runaway collapse coastal systems
