genome analysis platypus reveals unique signatures evolution 
present draft genome sequence platypus ornithorhynchus anatinus monotreme exhibits fascinating combination reptilian mammalian characters example platypuses coat fur adapted aquatic lifestyle platypus females lactate yet lay eggs males equipped venom similar reptiles analysis first monotreme genome aligned features genetic innovations find reptile platypus venom proteins co opted independently gene families milk protein genes conserved despite platypuses laying eggs immune gene family expansions directly related platypus biology expansions protein non protein coding rna microrna families well repeat elements identified sequencing genome now provides valuable resource deep mammalian comparative analyses well monotreme biology conservation
