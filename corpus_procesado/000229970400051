endocannabinoid mechanism stress-induced analgesia 
acute stress suppresses pain activating brain pathways engage opioid non-opioid mechanisms show opioid-independent form phenomenon termed stress-induced analgesia mediated release endogenous marijuana-like cannabinoid compounds brain blockade cannabinoid cb1 receptors periaqueductal grey matter midbrain prevents non-opioid stress-induced analgesia region stress elicits rapid formation two endogenous cannabinoids lipids arachidonoylglycerol -ag anandamide newly developed inhibitor ag-deactivating enzyme monoacylglycerol lipase selectively increases ag concentrations injected periaqueductal grey matter enhances stress-induced analgesia cb1-dependent manner inhibitors anandamide-deactivating enzyme fatty-acid amide hydrolase selectively elevate anandamide concentrations exert similar effects results indicate coordinated release ag anandamide periaqueductal grey matter might mediate opioid-independent stress-induced analgesia studies also identify monoacylglycerol lipase previously unrecognized therapeutic target
