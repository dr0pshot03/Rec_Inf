string tension stability magic tip-suspended nanowires
multishell helical gold nanowires recently imaged electron microscopy show theoretically contact gold tips either end wire plays crucial role local minima string tension rather total wire free energy determine nanowire stability density functional electronic structure calculations simplest thinnest coaxial gold silver wires variable radius chirality carried found string tension minimum single-tube gold nanowire chiral consists seven strands striking agreement observation contrast minimum found silver s-d competition leading surface reconstruction lacking
