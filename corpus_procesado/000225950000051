enterococcus faecalis senses target cells response expresses cytolysin 
many virulent strains enterococcus faecalis produce two-subunit toxin termed cytolysin cytolysin expression regulated one subunits cylls" quorum-sensing autoinduction mechanism found target cells absent subunit cylll" forms complex cylls" blocking autoinducing operon target cells present however cylll" binds preferentially target allowing free cylls" accumulate induction threshold thus enterococci use cylll" actively probe environment target cells target cells detected allows organism express high levels cytolysin response
