ecological immunological determinants influenza evolution 
pandemic epidemic forms influenza causes substantial sometimes catastrophic morbidity mortality intense selection host immune system drives antigenic change influenza b resulting continuous replacement circulating strains new variants able re-infect hosts immune earlier types antigenic drift1 often requires new vaccine formulated annual epidemic however given high transmissibility mutation rate influenza constancy genetic diversity within lineages time paradoxical another enigma replacement existing strains global pandemic caused antigenic shift-the introduction new avian influenza subtype human population1 explore ecological immunological factors underlying patterns using mathematical model capturing realistic epidemiological dynamics viral evolution sequence level matching model output phylogenetic patterns seen sequence data collected global surveillance2 find short-lived strain-transcending immunity essential restrict viral diversity host population thus explain key aspects drift shift dynamics
