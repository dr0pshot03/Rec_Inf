broken-symmetry states doubly gated suspended bilayer graphene
single-particle energy spectra graphene bilayer counterpart exhibit multiple degeneracies arise inherent symmetries interactions among charge carriers spontaneously break symmetries lead ordered states exhibit energy gaps quantum hall regime states predicted ferromagnetic nature whereby system becomes spin polarized layer polarized parabolic dispersion bilayer graphene makes susceptible interaction-induced symmetry breaking even zero magnetic field investigated underlying order various broken-symmetry states bilayer graphene suspended top bottom gate electrodes deduced order parameter various quantum hall ferromagnetic states controllably breaking spin sublattice symmetries small carrier density identified three distinct broken-symmetry states one consistent either spontaneously broken time-reversal symmetry spontaneously broken rotational symmetry
