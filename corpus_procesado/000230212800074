ubiquitination nonlysine residues viral e3 ubiquitin ligase 
ubiquitination controls broad range cellular functions last step ubiquitination pathway regulated enzyme type e3 ubiquitin ligases e3 enzymes responsible substrate specificity catalyze formation isopeptide bond lysine residue substrate n terminus substrate ubiquitin mir1 mir2 two e3 ubiquitin ligases encoded kaposis sarcoma-associated herpesvirus mediate ubiquitination major histocompatibility complex class mhc molecules subsequent internalization found mir1 mir2 promoted down-regulation mhc molecules lacking lysine residues intracytoplasmic domain presence mir1 mhc molecules ubiquitinated association ubiquitin sensitive p beta-mercaptoethanol unlike lysine-ubiquitin bonds form ubiquitination required cysteine residue intracytoplasmic tail mhc molecules mhc molecule containing single cysteine residue artificial glycine atanine intracytoplasmic domain endocytosed degraded presence mir1 thus ubiquitination can occur proteins lacking accessible lysines accessible n terminus
