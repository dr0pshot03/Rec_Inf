dirac strings magnetic monopoles spin ice dy2ti2o7 
sources magnetic fields-magnetic monopoles-have far proven elusive elementary particles condensed-matter physicists recently proposed several scenarios emergent quasiparticles resembling monopoles particularly simple proposition pertains spin ice highly frustrated pyrochlore lattice spin-ice state argued well described networks aligned dipoles resembling solenoidal tubes-classical observable versions dirac string tubes end resulting defects look like magnetic monopoles demonstrated diffuse neutron scattering presence strings spin ice dysprosium titanate dy2ti2o7 achieved applying symmetry-breaking magnetic field can manipulate density orientation strings turn heat capacity described gas magnetic monopoles interacting via magnetic coulomb interaction
