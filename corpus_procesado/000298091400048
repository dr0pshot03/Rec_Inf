revealing atom-radical reactivity low temperature n plus oh reaction 
reactions stable molecules free radicals shown remain rapid low temperatures contrast reactions two unstable radicals received much less attention due added complexity producing measuring excess radical concentrations performed kinetic experiments barrierless n4s + oh2pi > h2s + no2pi reaction supersonic flow laval nozzle reactor used microwave-discharge method generate atomic nitrogen relative-rate method follow reaction kinetics measured rates agreed well results exact approximate quantum mechanical calculations results also provide insight gas-phase formation mechanisms molecular nitrogen interstellar clouds
