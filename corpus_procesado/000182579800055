gaba agonists improved visual cortical function senescent monkeys
human cerebral cortical function degrades old age much change may result degradation intracortical inhibition senescence used multibarreled microelectrodes study effects electrophoretic application gamma-aminobutyric acid gaba gaba type gabaa receptor agonist muscimol gabaa receptor antagonist bicuculline respectively properties individual v1 cells old monkeys bicuculline exerted much weaker effect neuronal responses old young animals confirming degradation gaba-mediated inhibition hand administration gaba muscimol resulted improved visual function many treated cells area v1 old animals displayed responses typical young cells present results important implications treatment sensory motor cognitive declines accompany old age
