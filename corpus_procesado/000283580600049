visualizing ribosome biogenesis: parallel assembly pathways 30s subunit 
ribosomes self-assembling macromolecular machines translate dna proteins understanding ribosome biogenesis central cellular physiology previous studies escherichia coli 30s subunit suggest ribosome assembly occurs via multiple parallel pathways rather single rate-limiting step little mechanistic information known process discovery single-particle profiling dsp application time-resolved electron microscopy used obtain million snapshots assembling 30s subunits identify visualize structures assembly intermediates monitor population flux intermediates time dsp results integrated mass spectrometry data construct first ribosome-assembly mechanism incorporates binding dependencies rate constants structural characterization populated intermediates
