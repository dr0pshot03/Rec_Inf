elastic anisotropy earths inner core
earths solid iron inner core elastically anisotropic sound waves propagate faster along earths spin axis equatorial plane anisotropy previously explained preferred orientation iron alloy hexagonal crystals however hexagonal iron becomes increasingly isotropic increasing temperature pressures inner core therefore unlikely cause anisotropy alternative explanation supported diamond anvil cell experiments iron adopts body centered cubic form inner core show molecular dynamics simulations body centered cubic iron phase extremely anisotropic sound waves despite high symmetry direct simulations seismic wave propagation reveal anisotropy % value adequate explain anisotropy inner core
