atomic-scale origins slowness cyanobacterial circadian clock
circadian clocks generate slow ordered cellular dynamics consist fast-moving bio-macromolecules consequently origins overall slowness remain unclear identified adenosine triphosphate atp catalytic region [adenosine triphosphatase atpase] amino-terminal half clock protein kaic minimal pacemaker controls vivo frequency cyanobacterial clock crystal structures atpase revealed slowness atpase arises sequestration lytic water molecule unfavorable position coupling atp hydrolysis peptide isomerization high activation energy slow atpase coupled another atpase catalyzing autodephosphorylation carboxyl-terminal half kaic yielding circadian response frequency intermolecular interactions clock-related proteins influences transcription translation cycle
