experimental nutrient additions accelerate terrestrial carbon loss stream ecosystems
nutrient pollution freshwater ecosystems results predictable increases carbon c sequestration algae tests nutrient enrichment fates terrestrial organic c supports riverine food webs source co2 lacking using whole-stream nitrogen n phosphorus p additions spanning equivalent years found average terrestrial organic c residence time reduced similar % compared reference conditions result nutrient pollution annual inputs terrestrial organic c rapidly depleted via release detrital food webs n p co-limitation magnitude terrestrial c loss can potentially exceed predicted algal c gains nutrient enrichment across large parts river networks diminishing associated ecosystem services
