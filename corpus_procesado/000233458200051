cellular biochemical networks function noisy environment using imperfect components particular networks involved gene regulation signal transduction allow small output tolerances underlying network structures can expected undergone evolution inherent robustness perturbations combine theoretical experimental analyses investigate optimal design signalling network bacterial chemotaxis one thoroughly studied signalling networks biology experimentally determine extent intercellular variations expression levels chemotaxis proteins use computer simulations quantify robustness several hypothetical chemotaxis pathway topologies gene expression noise demonstrate among topologies experimentally established chemotaxis network escherichia coli smallest sufficiently robust network structure allowing accurate chemotactic response almost individuals within population results suggest pathway evolved show optimal chemotactic performance minimizing cost resources associated high levels protein expression moreover underlying topological design principles compensating intercellular variations seem highly conserved among bacterial chemosensory systems
