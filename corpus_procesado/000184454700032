transformation control ultra-short pulses dispersion-engineered photonic crystal fibres
photonic crystal fibres pcfs offer greatly enhanced design freedom compared standard optical fibres example allow precise control chromatic dispersion cd profile-the frequency dependence propagation speed-over broad wavelength range permits studies nonlinear pulse propagation previously inaccessible parameter regimes report spectral broadening fs pulses pcfs anomalously flat cd profiles maps spectral spatio-temporal behaviour function power show dramatic conversion longer shorter wavelengths can occur remarkably short lengths fibre depending magnitude shape cd profile pcfs used single-mode wavelengths light always emerges fundamental guided mode excellent agreement obtained experimental results numerical solutions nonlinear wave equation indicating underlying processes can reliably modelled results show appropriate choice cd nonlinearities can efficiently harnessed generate laser light new wavelengths
