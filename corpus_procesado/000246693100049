disulphide-isomerase-enabled shedding tumour-associated nkg2d ligands 
tumour-associated ligands activating nkg2d natural killer group member d also called klrk1 receptor induced genotoxic cellular stress trigger activation natural killer cells co-stimulation effector t cells may thus promote resistance cancer- however many progressing tumours humans counter anti-tumour activity shedding soluble major histocompatibility complex class-i-related ligand mica induces internalization degradation nkg2d stimulates population expansions normally rare nkg2d+ cd4+ t cells negative regulatory functions- show surface tumour cells mica associates endoplasmic reticulum protein erp5 also called pdia6 p5 similar protein disulphide isomerase usually assists folding nascent proteins inside cells pharmacological inhibition thioreductase activity erp5 gene silencing revealed cell-surface erp5 function required mica shedding erp5 membrane-anchored mica form transitory mixed disulphide complexes soluble mica released proteolytic cleavage near cell membrane reduction seemingly inaccessible disulphide bond membrane-proximal alpha domain mica must involve large conformational change enables proteolytic cleavage results uncover molecular mechanism whereby domain-specific deconstruction regulates mica protein shedding thereby promoting tumour immune evasion identify surface erp5 strategic target therapeutic intervention
