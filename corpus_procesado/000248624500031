harnessing attosecond science quest coherent x-rays 
modern laser technology revolutionized sensitivity precision spectroscopy providing coherent light spectrum spanning infrared visible ultraviolet wavelength regimes however generation shorter-wavelength coherent pulses x-ray region proven much challenging recent emergence high harmonic generation techniques opens door possibility review new science enabled ability manipulate control electrons attosecond time scales ranging new tabletop sources coherent x-rays ability follow complex electron dynamics molecules materials also explore implications advances future molecular structural characterization schemes currently rely heavily scattering incoherent x-ray sources
