switch-based mechanism kinesin motors 
kinesin motors specialized enzymes use hydrolysis atp generate force movement along cellular tracks microtubules although numerous biochemical biophysical studies accumulated much data link microtubule-assisted atp hydrolysis kinesin motion structural view kinesin movement remains unclear study monomeric kinesin motor kif1a combines x-ray crystallography cryo-electron microscopy allows analysis force-generating conformational changes atomic resolution motor revealed two functionally critical states-complexed adp non-hydrolysable analogue atp conformational change observed adp-bound atp-like structures kif1a catalytic core modular extends kinesins similar conformational change used myosin motors g proteins docking adp-bound atp-like crystallographic models kif1a corresponding cryo-electron microscopy maps suggests rationale plus-end directional bias associated kinesin catalytic core
