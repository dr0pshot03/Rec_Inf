tethered niacin-derived pincer complex nickel-carbon bond lactate racemase 
lactic acid racemization involved lactate metabolism cell wall assembly many microorganisms lactate racemase lar requires nickel nickel-binding site role three accessory proteins required activation remain enigmatic combined mass spectrometry x-ray crystallography show lar lactobacillus plantarum possesses organometallic nickel-containing prosthetic group nicotinic acid mononucleotide derivative tethered lys forms tridentate pincer complex coordinates nickel one metal-carbon two metal-sulfur bonds another ligand although similar complexes previously synthesized prior evidence existence pincer cofactors enzymes wide distribution accessory proteins without lar suggests may play role enzymes
