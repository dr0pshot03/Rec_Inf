scalable t- resistivity small single-component fermi surface 
scattering among electrons generates distinct contribution electrical resistivity follows quadratic temperature t dependence strongly correlated electron systems prefactor t- resistivity scales magnitude electronic specific heat gamma show one can change magnitude four orders magnitude metallic strontium titanate srtio3 tuning concentration carriers consequently fermi energy t- behavior persists single-band dilute limit despite absence two known mechanisms t- behavior: distinct electron reservoirs umklapp processes results highlight absence microscopic theory momentum decay electron-electron scattering various fermi liquids
