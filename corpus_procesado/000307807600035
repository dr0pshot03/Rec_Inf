luminous supernovae 
supernovae luminous explosions stars observed since antiquity however various examples superluminous supernovae slsne; luminosities > x ergs per second recently documented accumulated evidence slsne can classified radioactively powered slsn-r hydrogen-rich slsn-ii hydrogen-poor slsn-i luminous class slsn-ii slsn-i classes common whereas slsn-r class better understood physical origins extreme luminosity emitted slsne focus current research
