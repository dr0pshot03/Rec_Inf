graded regulation kv2 potassium channel variable phosphorylation
dynamic modulation ion channels phosphorylation underlies neuronal plasticity kv2 potassium channel highly phosphorylated resting mammalian neurons activity-dependent kv2 dephosphorylation calcineurin induces graded hyperpolarizing shifts voltage-dependent activation causing suppression neuronal excitability mass spectrometry-silac stable isotope labeling amino acids cell culture identified kv2 phosphorylation sites dephosphorylated calcineurin mutation individual calcineurin-regulated sites alanine produced incremental shifts mimicking dephosphorylation whereas mutation aspartate yielded equivalent resistance calcineurin mutations multiple sites additive showing variable phosphorylation kv2 large number sites allows graded activity-dependent regulation channel gating neuronal firing properties
