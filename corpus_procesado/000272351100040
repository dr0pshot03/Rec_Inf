coupling co2 ice sheet stability major climate transitions last million years 
carbon dioxide co2 content atmosphere varied cyclically similar similar parts per million volume past years closely coupled temperature sea level earlier periods earths history partial pressure co2 pco2 much less certain relation pco2 climate remains poorly constrained use boron/calcium ratios foraminifera estimate pco2 major climate transitions past million years middle miocene temperatures similar degrees degrees c warmer sea level meters higher present pco2 appears similar modern levels decreases pco2 apparently synchronous major episodes glacial expansion middle miocene similar million years ago late pliocene similar million years ago
