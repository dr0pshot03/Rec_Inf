lpa-mediated lysophosphatidic acid signalling embryo implantation spacing
every successful pregnancy requires proper embryo implantation low implantation rate major problem infertility treatments using assisted reproductive technologies report newly discovered molecular influence implantation lysophosphatidic acid lpa receptor lpa refs targeted deletion lpa mice resulted significantly reduced litter size attributed delayed implantation altered embryo spacing two events led delayed embryonic development hypertrophic placentas shared multiple embryos embryonic death enzyme demonstrated influence implantation cyclooxygenase cox2 ref downregulated lpa-deficient uteri preimplantation downregulation cox2 led reduced levels prostaglandins e pge pgi critical implantation exogenous administration pge carbaprostacyclin stable analogue pgi lpa-deficient female mice rescued delayed implantation rescue defects embryo spacing data identify lpa receptor-mediated signalling influence implantation indicate linkage lpa signalling prostaglandin biosynthesis
