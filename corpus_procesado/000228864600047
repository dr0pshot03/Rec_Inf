lpa3-mediated lysophosphatidic acid signalling embryo implantation spacing 
every successful pregnancy requires proper embryo implantation low implantation rate major problem infertility treatments using assisted reproductive technologies1 report newly discovered molecular influence implantation lysophosphatidic acid lpa receptor lpa3 refs targeted deletion lpa3 mice resulted significantly reduced litter size attributed delayed implantation altered embryo spacing two events led delayed embryonic development hypertrophic placentas shared multiple embryos embryonic death enzyme demonstrated influence implantation cyclooxygenase cox2 ref downregulated lpa3-deficient uteri preimplantation downregulation cox2 led reduced levels prostaglandins e- i- pge2 pgi2 critical implantation1 exogenous administration pge2 carbaprostacyclin stable analogue pgi2 lpa3-deficient female mice rescued delayed implantation rescue defects embryo spacing data identify lpa3 receptor-mediated signalling influence implantation indicate linkage lpa signalling prostaglandin biosynthesis
