finite scale spatial representation hippocampus 
determine spatial scale represented pyramidal cell population hippocampus recorded neural activity multiple longitudinal levels brain area rats ran back forth meter long linear track ca3 cells well defined place fields levels scale representation increased almost linearly < meter dorsal pole similar meters ventral pole results suggest place cell map includes entire hippocampus environments represented hippocampus topographically graded finite continuum scales
