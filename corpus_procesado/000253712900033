oncogene-induced dna damage model cancer development
types dna damage dna double strand breaks dsbs pose greatest challenge cells one might therefore anticipated sizable number dna dsbs incompatible cell proliferation yet recent experimental findings suggest precancerous lesions cancers activated oncogenes induce stalling collapse dna replication forks turn leads formation dna dsbs continuous formation dna dsbs may contribute genomic instability characterizes vast majority human cancers addition precancerous lesions dna dsbs activate p53 inducing apoptosis senescence raises barrier tumor progression breach barrier various mechanisms notably p53 mutations impair dna damage response pathway allows cancers develop thus oncogene induced dna damage may explain two key features cancer: genomic instability high frequency p53 mutations
