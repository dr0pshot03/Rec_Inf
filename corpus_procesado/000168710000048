alpha-camkii-dependent plasticity cortex required permanent memory 
cortical plasticity seems critical establishment permanent memory traces1- little known however molecular cellular processes support consolidation memories cortical networks45 show mice heterozygous null mutation a-calcium-calmodulin kinase ii alpha camkii+/- show normal learning memory - days training two hippocampus-dependent tasks however memory severely impaired longer retention delays - days consistent found alpha camkii+/ mice impaired cortical hippocampal long-term potentiation results represent first step unveiling molecular cellular mechanisms underlying establishment permanent memories indicate alpha camkii may modulate synaptic events required consolidation memory traces cortical networks
