variability el nino southern oscillation glacial-interglacial cycle 
el nino-southern oscillation enso potent source interannual climate variability uncertainty surrounding impact greenhouse warming enso strength frequency stimulated efforts develop better understanding sensitivity enso climate change use annually banded corals papua new guinea show enso existed past years operating even glacial times substantially reduced regional global temperature changed solar forcing however also find 20th century enso strong compared enso previous cool glacial warm interglacial times observed pattern change amplitude may due combined effects enso dampening cool glacial conditions enso forcing precessional orbital variations
