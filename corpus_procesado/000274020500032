free-energy landscape clusters attractive hard spheres
study clusters provided tangible link local geometry bulk condensed matter experiments yet systematically explored thermodynamics smallest clusters present experimental measurements structures free energies colloidal clusters particles act hard spheres short-range attractions found highly symmetric clusters strongly suppressed rotational entropy whereas stable clusters anharmonic vibrational modes extra bonds many clusters subsets close-packed lattices number particles increases observe emergence complex free-energy landscape small number ground states many local minima
