biomechanical energy harvesting: generating electricity walking minimal user effort
developed biomechanical energy harvester generates electricity human walking little extra effort unlike conventional human powered generators use positive muscle work technology assists muscles performing negative work analogous regenerative braking hybrid cars energy normally dissipated braking drives generator instead energy harvester mounts knee selectively engages power generation end swing phase thus assisting deceleration joint test subjects walking one device leg produced average watts electricity times shoe mounted devices cost harvesting additional metabolic power required produce watt electricity less one eighth conventional human power generation producing substantial electricity little extra effort makes method well suited charging powered prosthetic limbs portable medical devices
