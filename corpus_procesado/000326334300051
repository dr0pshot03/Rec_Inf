regulation temperature-responsive flowering mads-box transcription factor repressors
changes ambient temperature affect flowering time plants understanding phenomenon will crucial buffering agricultural systems effects climate change show levels flm-beta alternatively spliced form flowering repressor flowering locus m increase lower temperatures repressing flowering flm-beta interacts short vegetative phase svp svp degraded high temperatures reducing abundance svp-flm-beta repressor complex thus allowing plant flower svp flm mutants show temperature-insensitive flowering different temperature ranges control svp-flm-beta repressor complex abundance via transcriptional splicing regulation flm posttranslational regulation svp protein stability provides efficient rapid mechanism plants respond ambient temperature changes
