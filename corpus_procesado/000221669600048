elastic behavior cross-linked bundled actin networks
networks cross-linked bundled actin laments ubiquitous cellular cytoskeleton elasticity remains poorly understood show networks exhibit exceptional elastic behavior reflects mechanical properties individual laments two distinct regimes elasticity one reflecting bending single laments second reflecting stretching entropic fluctuations filament length mechanical stiffness can vary several decades small changes cross-link concentration can increase markedly upon application external stress parameterize full range behavior state diagram elucidate origin robust model
