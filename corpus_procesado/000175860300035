optical pulsations anomalous x-ray pulsar 4u0142+ 
anomalous x-ray pulsars axps differ ordinary radio pulsars x-ray luminosity orders magnitude greater rate rotational energy loss require additional energy source one possibility axps highly magnetized neuron stars-or magnetars-having surface magnetic fields greater g make similar soft gamma-ray repeaters sgrs alternative models require extreme magnetic fields also exist optical counterpart axp 4u0142+ recently discovered consistent emission magnetar also magnetized hot white dwarf accreting isolated neutron star report detection optical pulsations 4u0142+ pulsed fraction optical light per cent five ten times greater soft x-rays conclude 4u0142+ magnetar although establishes direct relationship axps soft gamma-ray repeaters evolutionary connection axps sgrs radio pulsars remains controversial
