snapshots dsba action: detection proteins process oxidative folding 
dsba thioredoxin superfamily member introduces disulfide bonds newly translocated proteins process thought occur via formation mixed disulfide complexes dsba substrates however complexes difficult detect probably short-lived nature show possible detect covalent intermediates vivo mutation dsba alters cis proline- mutant allowed us identify substrates dsba alteration cis proline highly conserved among thioredoxin superfamily members may useful detection substrates intermediate complexes systems
