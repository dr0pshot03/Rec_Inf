catalytic production olefin block copolymers via chain shuttling polymerization
report catalytic system produces olefin block copolymers alternating semicrystalline amorphous segments achieved varying ratio alpha-olefin ethylene two types blocks system uses chain shuttling agent transfer growing chains two distinct catalysts different monomer selectivities single polymerization reactor block copolymers simultaneously high melting temperatures low glass transition temperatures therefore maintain excellent elastomeric properties high temperatures furthermore materials effectively produced economically favorable continuous polymerization processes
