transposon-based genetic screen mice identifies genes altered colorectal cancer 
human colorectal cancers crcs display large number genetic epigenetic alterations causally involved tumorigenesis drivers others little functional impact passengers help distinguish two classes alterations used transposon-based genetic screen mice identify candidate genes crc mice harboring mutagenic sleeping beauty sb transposons crossed mice expressing sb transposase gastrointestinal tract epithelium offspring developed intestinal lesions including intraepithelial neoplasia adenomas adenocarcinomas analysis transposon insertions identified candidate crc genes mutated and/or dysregulated human crc thus likely drive tumorigenesis genes include apc pten smad4 screen also identified candidate genes previously implicated crc including poli ptprk rspo2
