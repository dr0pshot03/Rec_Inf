operation dna robot arm inserted 2d dna crystalline substrate
success nanorobotics requires precise placement subsequent operation specific nanomechanical devices particular locations structural programmability dna makes particularly attractive system nanorobotics developed cassette enables placement robust sequence-dependent dna robot arm within two-dimensional 2d crystalline dna array cassette contains device attachment site reporter state used atomic force microscopy demonstrate rotary device fully functional insertion thus nanomechanical device can operate within fixed frame reference
