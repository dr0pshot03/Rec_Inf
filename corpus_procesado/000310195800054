australopithecus afarensis scapular ontogeny function role climbing human evolution 
scapular morphology predictive locomotor adaptations among primates skeletal element scarce hominin fossil record notably scapulae juvenile australopithecus afarensis skeleton dikika ethiopia recovered scapulae display several traits characteristic suspensory apes known fragmentary adult australopith representatives many traits change significantly throughout modern human ontogeny remain stable apes thus similarity juvenile adult fossil morphologies implies afarensis development apelike additionally changes scapular traits throughout african ape development associated shifts locomotor behavior affirms functional relevance characteristics presence australopith fossils supports hypothesis locomotor repertoire included substantial amount climbing
