stochastic spineless expression creates retinal mosaic colour vision 
drosophila colour vision achieved r7 r8 photoreceptor cells present every ommatidium fly retina contains two types ommatidia called pale yellow defined different rhodopsin pairs expressed r7 r8 cells similar human cone photoreceptors ommatidial subtypes distributed stochastically retina choice pale versus yellow ommatidia made r7 cells impose fate onto r8 report drosophila dioxin receptor spineless necessary sufficient formation ommatidial mosaic short burst spineless expression mid-pupation large subset r7 cells precedes rhodopsin expression spineless mutants r7 r8 cells adopt pale fate whereas overexpression spineless sufficient induce yellow r7 fate therefore study suggests entire retinal mosaic required colour vision defined stochastic expression single transcription factor spineless
