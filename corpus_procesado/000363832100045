organometallic palladium reagents cysteine bioconjugation
reactions based transition metals found wide use organic synthesis particular functionalization small molecules however reports using transition-metal-based reactions modify complex biomolecules due need stringent reaction conditions example aqueous media low temperature mild ph existence multiple reactive functional groups found biomolecules report palladiumii complexes can used efficient highly selective cysteine conjugation bioconjugation reactions rapid robust range bio-compatible reaction conditions straightforward synthesis palladium reagents diverse easily accessible aryl halide trifluoromethanesulfonate precursors makes method highly practical providing access large structural space protein modification resulting aryl bioconjugates stable towards acids bases oxidants external thiol nucleo-philes broad utility bioconjugation platform corroborated synthesis new classes stapled peptides antibody-drug conjugates palladium complexes show potential benchtop reagents diverse bioconjugation applications
