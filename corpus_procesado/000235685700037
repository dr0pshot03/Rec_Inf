magnetically collimated jet evolved star
planetary nebulae often asymmetric shapes even though progenitor stars symmetric structure result collimated jets evolved stars enter planetary nebula phase- theoretical models shown magnetic fields dominant source jet-collimation evolved stars just fields thought collimate outflows astrophysical sources active galactic nuclei- proto-stars hitherto direct observations magnetic field direction strength collimated jet report measurements polarization water vapour masers trace precessing jet emanating asymptotic giant branch star w43a distance kpc sun undergoing rapid evolution planetary nebula masers occur two clusters opposing tips jets similar au star conclude data magnetic field indeed collimating jet
