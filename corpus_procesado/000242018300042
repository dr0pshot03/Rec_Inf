hydrodynamic turbulence transport angular momentum effectively astrophysical disks
efficient energy sources known universe accretion disks around black holes convert per cent restmass energy radiation like water circling drain inflowing mass must lose angular momentum presumably vigorous turbulence disks essentially inviscid origin turbulence unclear hot disks electrically conducting plasma can become turbulent way linear magnetorotational instability cool disks planet forming disks protostars may poorly ionized magnetorotational instability occur therefore essentially unmagnetized linearly stable nonlinear hydrodynamic instability often occurs linearly stable flows example pipe flows sufficiently large reynolds numbers although planet forming disks extreme reynolds numbers keplerian rotation enhances linear hydrodynamic stability question whether can turbulent thereby transport angular momentum effectively controversial- report laboratory experiment demonstrating non magnetic quasi keplerian flows reynolds numbers millions essentially steady scaled accretion disks rates angular momentum transport lie far astrophysical requirements ruling purely hydrodynamic turbulence results indirectly support magnetorotational instability likely cause turbulence even cool disks
