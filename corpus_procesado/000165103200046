kingdom-level phylogeny eukaryotes based combined protein data 
current understanding higher order systematics eukaryotes relies largely analyses small ribosomal subunit rna ssu rrna independent testing results still limited combined sequences four broadly taxonomically sampled proteins available create roughly parallel data set ssu rrna resulting phylogenetic tree shows number striking differences ssu rrna phylogeny including strong support major groups several major supergroups
