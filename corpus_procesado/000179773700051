rainfall variability carbon cycling plant species diversity mesic grassland
ecosystem responses increased variability rainfall prediction general circulation models assessed native grassland reducing storm frequency increasing rainfall quantity per storm year experiment extreme rainfall patterns without concurrent changes total rainfall quantity increased temporal variability soil moisture plant species diversity however carbon cycling processes soil co2 flux co2 uptake dominant grasses aboveground net primary productivity anpp reduced anpp responsive soil moisture variability mean soil water content results show projected increases rainfall variability can rapidly alter key carbon cycling processes plant community composition independent changes total precipitation
