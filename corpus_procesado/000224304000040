kondo effect presence ferromagnetism 
measured kondo-assisted tunneling via c molecules contact ferromagnetic nickel electrodes kondo correlations persisted despite presence ferromagnetism kondo peak differential conductance split amount decreased even zero moments two electrodes turned parallel antiparallel alignment splitting large explained local magnetic field however voltage temperature magnetic field dependence signals agree predictions exchange splitting kondo resonance kondo effect leads negative values magnetoresistance magnitudes much larger julliere estimate
