magnetic resonance fingerprinting
magnetic resonance exceptionally powerful versatile measurement technique basic structure magnetic resonance experiment remained largely unchanged almost years mainly restricted qualitative probing limited set properties can principle accessed technique introduce approach data acquisition post-processing visualization term magnetic resonance fingerprinting mrf permits simultaneous non-invasive quantification multiple important properties material tissue mrf thus provides alternative way quantitatively detect analyse complex changes can represent physical alterations substance early indicators disease mrf can also used identify presence specific target material tissue will increase sensitivity specificity speed magnetic resonance study potentially lead new diagnostic testing methodologies when-paired appropriate pattern-recognition algorithm mrf inherently suppresses measurement errors can thus improve measurement accuracy
