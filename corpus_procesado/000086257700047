pervasive density-dependent recruitment enhances seedling diversity tropical forest
negative density-dependent recruitment seedlings seeds given species less likely become established seedlings density species high proposed important mechanism contributing extraordinary diversity tropical tree communities- can potentially prevent particular species usurping available space either close proximity seed sources relatively larger spatial scales- however density-dependent recruitment necessarily enhance community diversity furthermore although density-dependent effects found life stages species- study shown density-dependent recruitment affects community diversity report results observations lowland moist forest republic panama species identities seeds arrived seed traps compared species identities seedlings recruited adjacent plots year period across sites recruit seedling diversity significantly higher seed diversity part difference explained interspecies differences average recruitment success even accounting differences however negative density-dependent recruitment contributes significantly increase diversity seeds seedling recruits
