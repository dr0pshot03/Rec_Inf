pervasive density-dependent recruitment enhances seedling diversity tropical forest 
negative density-dependent recruitment seedlings seeds given species less likely become established seedlings density species high proposed important mechanism contributing extraordinary diversity tropical tree communities1- can potentially prevent particular species usurping available space either close proximity seed sources relatively larger spatial scales1- however density-dependent recruitment necessarily enhance community diversity14 furthermore although density-dependent effects found life stages species3- study shown density-dependent recruitment affects community diversity1415 report results observations lowland moist forest republic panama species identities seeds arrived seed traps compared species identities seedlings recruited adjacent plots -year period across sites recruit seedling diversity significantly higher seed diversity part difference explained interspecies differences average recruitment success even accounting differences however negative density-dependent recruitment contributes significantly increase diversity seeds seedling recruits
