transgene transposon silencing chlamydomonas reinhardtii deah-box rna helicase
molecular mechanisms responsible posttranscriptional gene silencing rna interference remain poorly understood cloned gene mut6 unicellular green alga chlamydomonas reinhardtii required silencing transgene two transposon families mut6 encodes protein highly homologous rna helicases deah-box family protein necessary degradation certain aberrant rnas improperly processed transcripts often produced transposons transgenes
