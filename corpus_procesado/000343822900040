medial prefrontal activity delay period contributes learning working memory task 
cognitive processes require working memory wm involves brief period memory retention known delay period elevated delay-period activity medial prefrontal cortex mpfc observed functional role wm tasks remains unclear optogenetically suppressed enhanced activity pyramidal neurons mouse mpfc delay period behavioral performance impaired learning phase mice well trained delay-period mpfc activity appeared important memory retention inhibitory control decision-making motor selection furthermore endogenous delay-period mpfc activity showed prominent modulation correlated memory retention behavioral performance thus properly regulated mpfc delay-period activity critical information retention learning wm task
