saturns fast spin determined gravitational field oblateness
alignment saturns magnetic pole rotation axis precludes use magnetic field measurements determine rotation period period previously determined radio measurements voyager spacecraft h min 4s ref cassini spacecraft measured period h min 6s additionally found change sequential measurements became clear radio period used determine bulk planetary rotation period estimates based upon saturns measured wind fields increased uncertainty even giving numbers smaller voyager rotation period present saturns rotation period thought h mm h min unsatisfactory fundamental property report period h mm s s based upon optimization approach using saturns measured gravitational field limits observed shape possible internal density profiles moreover even solely using constraints gravitational field rotation period can inferred precision several minutes validate method applied procedure jupiter correctly recovered well-known rotation period
