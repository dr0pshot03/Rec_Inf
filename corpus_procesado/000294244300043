irradiation history itokawa regolith material deduced noble gases hayabusa samples 
noble gas isotopes measured three rocky grains asteroid itokawa elucidate history irradiation cosmic rays solar wind surface large amounts solar helium neon ne argon ar trapped various depths grains observed can explained multiple implantations solar wind particles grains combined preferential loss caused frictional wear space-weathered rims grains short residence time less million years implied grains estimate cosmic-ray-produced 21ne results suggest itokawa continuously losing surface materials space rate tens centimeters per million years lifetime itokawa much shorter age solar system
