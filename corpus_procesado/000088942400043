function axonal chemoattractant modulated metalloprotease activity
axonal chemoattractant netrin guides spinal commissural axons activating receptor dcc deleted colorectal cancer found chemical inhibitors metalloproteases potentiate netrin-mediated axon outgrowth vitro also found dcc substrate metalloprotease-dependent ectodomain shedding inhibitors block proteolytic processing dcc cause increase dcc protein levels axons within spinal cord explants thus potentiation netrin activity inhibitors may result stabilization dcc axons proteolytic activity may regulate axon migration controlling number functional extracellular axon guidance receptors
