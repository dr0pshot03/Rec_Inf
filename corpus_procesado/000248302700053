dai dlm-/zbp1 cytosolic dna sensor activator innate immune response
central innate immunity sensing pathogen-associated molecular patterns cytosolic membrane-associated receptors- particular dna potent activator immune responses infection tissue damage- evidence indicates addition membrane-associated toll-like receptor unidentified cytosolic dna sensors can activate type interferon ifn immune responses- report candidate dna sensor previously named dlm also called z-dna binding protein zbp1 biological function remained unknown now propose alternative name dai dna-dependent activator ifn-regulatory factors artificial expression otherwise ifn-inducible dai dlm-/ zbp1 mouse fibroblasts selectively enhances dna-mediated induction type ifn genes involved innate immunity hand rna interference messenger rna dai dlm-/ zbp1 cells inhibits gene induction programme upon stimulation dna various sources moreover dai dlm-/zbp1 binds double-stranded dna enhances association irf3 transcription factor tbk1 serine/threonine kinase observations underscore integral role dai dlm-/zbp1 dna-mediated activation innate immune responses may offer new insight signalling mechanisms underlying dna associated antimicrobial immunity autoimmune disorders
