detection molecular interactions membrane surfaces colloid phase transitions 
molecular architecture biochemical processes within cell membranes play important roles living organisms many drugs infectious disease agents targeting membranes experimental studies biochemical reactions membrane surfaces challenging require membrane environment fluid like cell membranes nevertheless allows efficient detection characterization molecular interactions one approach uses lipid membranes supported solid substrates silica polymers12: although membrane trapped near solid interface retains natural fluidity biological functionality3 can implanted membrane proteins functional studies4 detection molecular interactions involving membrane-bound species generally requires elaborate techniques surface plasmon resonance5 total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy6 demonstrate colloidal phase transitions membrane-coated silica beads provide simple label-free method monitoring molecular interactions lipid membrane surfaces adjusting lipid membrane composition hence pair interaction potential membrane-supporting silica beads poise system near phase transition small perturbations membrane surface induce dramatic changes macroscopic organization colloid expect approach used probe high sensitivity protein binding events membrane surfaces can applied study broad range cell membrane processes
