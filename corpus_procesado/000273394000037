transient niche regulates specification drosophila intestinal stem cells 
stem cell niches locations stem cells reside self-renew although studies shown niches maintain stem cell fate tissue homeostasis less known roles establishing stem cells adult drosophila midgut maintained intestinal stem cells iscs however established unknown show isc progenitor generates niche cell via notch signaling niche uses bone morphogenetic protein / homolog decapentaplegic allow progenitors divide undifferentiated state subsequently breaks dies resulting specification iscs adult midgut results demonstrate paradigm stem cell-niche biology progenitors generate transient niches determine stem cell fate may give insights stem cell specification tissues
