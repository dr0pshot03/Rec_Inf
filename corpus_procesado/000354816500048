alternative pluripotent state confers interspecies chimaeric competency
pluripotency ability generate cell type body evanescent attribute embryonic cells transitory pluripotent cells can captured different time points embryogenesis maintained embryonic stem cells epiblast stem cells culture since ontogenesis dynamic process space time seems counterintuitive two temporal states represent full spectrum organismal pluripotency show modulating culture parameters stem-cell type unique spatial characteristics distinct molecular functional features designated region-selective pluripotent stem cells rspscs can efficiently obtained mouse embryos primate pluripotent stem cells including humans ease culturing editing genome human rspscs offers advantages regenerative medicine applications unique ability human rspscs generate post-implantation interspecies chimaeric embryos may facilitate understanding early human development evolution
