quantitative evolutionary dynamics using high-resolution lineage tracking 
evolution large asexual cell populations underlies similar % deaths worldwide including caused bacteria fungi parasites cancer however dynamics underlying evolutionary processes remain poorly understood involve many competing beneficial lineages never rise extremely low frequencies population observe normally hidden evolutionary dynamics constructed sequencing-based ultra high-resolution lineage tracking system saccharomyces cerevisiae allowed us monitor relative frequencies similar lineages simultaneously contrast expectations found spectrum fitness effects beneficial mutations neither exponential monotonic early adaptation predictable consequence spectrum strikingly reproducible initial small-effect mutations soon outcompeted rarer large-effect mutations result variability replicates results suggest early evolutionary dynamics may deterministic period time stochastic effects become important
