seismic evidence effects water melt transport lau back-arc mantle
processes melt generation transport beneath back-arc spreading centres controlled two endmember mechanisms: decompression melting similar mid-ocean ridges flux melting resembling beneath arcs lau basin abundance spreading ridges different distances subduction zone provides opportunity distinguish effects two different melting processes magma production crust formation present constraints three-dimensional distribution partial melt inferred seismic velocities obtained rayleigh wave tomography using land ocean-bottom seismographs low seismic velocities beneath central lau spreading centre northern eastern lau spreading centre extend deeper westwards back-arc suggesting spreading centres fed melting along upwelling zones west helping explain geochemical differences valu fa ridge south distinct deep low-seismic-velocity anomalies region low s-wave velocity interpreted resulting high melt content imaged mantle wedge beneath central lau spreading centre northeastern lau basin even active spreading centre currently exists low-seismic-velocity anomaly becomes weaker distance southward along eastern lau spreading centre valu fa ridge contrast inferred increase magmatic productivity propose anomaly variations result changes efficiency melt extraction decrease melt south correlating increased fractional melting higher water content magma water released slab may greatly reduce melt viscosity increase grain size thereby facilitating melt transport
