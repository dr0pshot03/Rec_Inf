sequential deposition route high-performance perovskite-sensitized solar cells 
following pioneering work1 solution-processable organic-inorganic hybrid perovskites-such ch3nh3pbx3 x cl br i-have attracted attention light-harvesting materials mesoscopic solar cells2- far perovskite pigment deposited single step onto mesoporous metal oxide films using mixture pbx2 ch3nh3x common solvent however uncontrolled precipitation perovskite produces large morphological variations resulting wide spread photovoltaic performance resulting devices hampers prospects practical applications describe sequential deposition method formation perovskite pigment within porous metal oxide film pbi2 first introduced solution nanoporous titanium dioxide film subsequently transformed perovskite exposing solution ch3nh3i find conversion occurs within nanoporous host soon two components come contact permitting much better control perovskite morphology possible previously employed route using technique fabrication solid-state mesoscopic solar cells greatly increases reproducibility performance allows us achieve power conversion efficiency approximately per cent measured standard am15g test conditions solar zenith angle solar light intensity cell temperature two-step method provide new opportunities fabrication solution-processed photovoltaic cells unprecedented power conversion efficiencies high stability equal even greater todays best thin-film photovoltaic devices
