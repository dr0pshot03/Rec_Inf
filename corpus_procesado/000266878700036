radio pulsars millisecond spin periods thought spun transfer matter angular momentum low-mass companion star x-ray-emitting phase spin periods neutron stars several low-mass x-ray binary lmxb systems shown millisecond regime radio pulsations detected report detection follow-up observations nearby radio millisecond pulsar msp circular binary orbit optically identified companion star optical observations indicate accretion disk present system within past decade optical data show evidence one exists today suggesting radio msp turned recent lmxb phase
