seasonality ocean microbial communities
ocean warming occurs every year seasonal cycles can help us understand long-term responses plankton climate change rhythmic seasonal patterns microbial community turnover revealed high-resolution measurements microbial plankton diversity applied samples collected lengthy time series seasonal cycles microbial plankton complex expansion fixed ocean stations monitoring long-term change development automated instrumentation providing time-series data needed understand cycles vary across broad geographical scales accumulating data using predictive modeling gain insights changes will occur ocean surface continues warm extent duration ocean stratification increase developments will enable marine scientists predict changes geochemical cycles mediated microbial communities gauge broader impacts
