complex n-heterocycle synthesis via iron-catalyzed direct c-h bond amination 
manipulation traditionally unreactive functional groups paramount importance modern chemical synthesis developed iron-dipyrrinato catalyst leverages reactivity iron-borne metal-ligand multiple bonds promote direct amination aliphatic c-h bonds exposure organic azides iron dipyrrinato catalyst furnishes saturated cyclic amine products n-heterocycles bearing complex core-substitution patterns study highlights development c-h bond functionalization chemistry formation saturated cyclic amine products find broad application context pharmaceuticals natural product synthesis
