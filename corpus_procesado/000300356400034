functional supramolecular polymers
supramolecular polymers can random entangled coils mechanical properties plastics elastomers great capacity processability recycling self-healing due reversible monomer-to-polymer transitions extreme supramolecular polymers can formed self-assembly among designed subunits yield shape-persistent highly ordered filaments use strong directional interactions among molecular subunits can achieve rich dynamic behavior also high degrees internal order known ordinary polymers can resemble example ordered dynamic one-dimensional supramolecular assemblies cell cytoskeleton possess useful biological electronic functions
