p53-induced inhibition hif causes cardiac dysfunction pressure overload
cardiac hypertrophy occurs adaptive response increased workload maintain cardiac function however prolonged cardiac hypertrophy causes heart failure mechanisms largely unknown show cardiac angiogenesis crucially involved adaptive mechanism cardiac hypertrophy p53 accumulation essential transition cardiac hypertrophy heart failure pressure overload initially promoted vascular growth heart hypoxia-inducible factor hif--dependent induction angiogenic factors inhibition angiogenesis prevented development cardiac hypertrophy induced systolic dysfunction sustained pressure overload induced accumulation p53 inhibited hif activity thereby impaired cardiac angiogenesis systolic function conversely promoting cardiac angiogenesis introducing angiogenic factors inhibiting p53 accumulation developed hypertrophy restored cardiac dysfunction chronic pressure overload results indicate anti-angiogenic property p53 may crucial function transition cardiac hypertrophy heart failure
