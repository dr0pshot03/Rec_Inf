structure integral membrane sterol reductase methylomicrobium alcaliphilum
sterols essential biological molecules majority life forms sterol reductases including delta-sterol reductase c14sr also known tm7sf2 dehydrocholesterol reductase dhcr7 dehydrocholesterol reductase dhcr24 reduce specific carbon-carbon double bonds sterol moiety using reducing cofactor sterol biosynthesis lamin b receptor lbr integral inner nuclear membrane protein also contains functional c14sr domain report crystal structure delta-sterol reductase masr1 methanotrophic bacterium methylomicro-bium alcaliphilum 20z homologue human c14sr lbr dhcr7 cofactor nadph enzyme contains ten transmembrane segments tm1- catalytic domain comprises carboxy-terminal half containing tm6- envelops two interconnected pockets one faces cytoplasm houses nadph one accessible lipid bilayer comparison soluble steroid beta-reductase structure suggests reducing end nadph meets sterol substrate juncture two pockets sterol reductase activity assay proves masr1 can reduce double bond cholesterol biosynthetic intermediate demonstrating functional conservation human c14sr therefore structure prototype integral membrane sterol reductases provides molecular insight mutations dhcr7 lbr inborn human diseases
