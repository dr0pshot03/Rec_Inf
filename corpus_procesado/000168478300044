energy gaps "metallic" single-walled carbon nanotubes 
metallic single-walled carbon nanotubes proposed good one-dimensional conductors however finite curvature graphene sheet forms nanotubes broken symmetry due local environment may modify electronic properties used low-temperature atomically resolved scanning tunneling microscopy investigate zigzag armchair nanotubes thought metallic "metallic" zigzag nanotubes found energy gaps magnitudes depend inversely square tube radius whereas isolated armchair tubes energy gaps additionally armchair nanotubes packed bundles pseudogaps exhibit inverse dependence tube radius observed energy gaps suggest "metallic" single-walled nanotubes true metals implications understanding electronic properties potential applications carbon nanotubes
