monodisperse double emulsions generated microcapillary device 
double emulsions highly structured fluids consisting emulsion drops contain smaller droplets inside although double emulsions potentially commercial value traditional fabrication means two emulsification steps leads ill-controlled structuring using microcapillary device fabricated double emulsions contained single internal droplet coreshell geometry show droplet size can quantitatively predicted flow profiles fluids double emulsions used generate encapsulation structures manipulating properties fluid makes shell high degree control afforded method completely separate fluid streams make flexible promising technique
