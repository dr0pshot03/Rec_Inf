optical coherent state discrimination using closed-loop quantum measurement 
quantum mechanics hinders ability determine state physical system two ways: individual measurements provide partial information observed system heisenberg uncertainty measurements invasive meaning little refinement achieved observation already measured system theoretical methods developed maximize information gained quantum measurement also minimizing disturbance- laboratory implementation optimal measurement procedures often difficult standard class operations considered quantum information theory tends rely superposition-basis entangled measurements require high-fidelity implementation effective laboratory demonstrate real-time quantum feedback- can used place delicate quantum superposition often called schrodinger cat state implement optimal quantum measurement discriminating optical coherent states procedure actively manipulates target system measurement process uses quantum feedback modify statistics otherwise sub-optimal operator emulate optimal cat-state measurement verify long-standing theoretical prediction demonstrate feedback-mediated quantum measurement fundamental quantum limit non-trivial region parameter space
