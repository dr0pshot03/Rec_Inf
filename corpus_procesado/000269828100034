misaligned spin orbital axes cause anomalous precession di herculis
orbits binary stars precess result general relativistic effects forces arising asphericity stars forces additional stars planets system binaries theoretical observed precession rates agreement one system however-di herculis-has resisted explanation years- observed precession rate factor four slower theoretical rate disagreement interpreted evidence failure general relativity among contemporary explanations existence circumbinary planet large tilt stellar spin axes respect orbit report stars di herculis rotate spin axes nearly perpendicular orbital axis contrary usual assumption close binary stars rotationally induced stellar oblateness causes precession direction opposite relativistic precession thereby reconciling theoretical observed rates
