distinct cohesin complexes organize meiotic chromosome domains
meiotic cohesin complexes centromeres behave differently along chromosome arms basis differences remained elusive fission yeast cohesin molecule rec8 largely replaces mitotic counterpart rad21/scc1 along entire chromosome meiosis show rec8 complexes along chromosome arms contain rec11 whereas vicinity centromeres different partner subunit psc3 arm-associated rec8-rec11 complexes critical meiotic recombination rec8-psc3 complexes comprise two different types assemblies first pericentromeric rec8-psc3 complexes depend histone methylation-directed heterochromatin localization required cohesion meiosis ii second central core rec8-psc3 complexes form independently heterochromatin presumably required establishing monopolar attachment meiosis findings define distinct modes assembly functions cohesin complexes different regions along chromosomes
