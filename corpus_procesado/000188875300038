ramp initiation thrust wedge
collisional mountain belts characterized fold thrust belts grow sequential stacking thrust sheets interior hinterland exterior foreland mountain belt- sheets rides fault cuts stratigraphic section inclined ramps join flat basal fault depth although stair-step ramp-flat geometry well known consensus particular ramp forms perturbations fault shape stratigraphy fluid pressure folding surface slope suggested possible mechanisms show pre-existing inhomogeneities though feasible causes required computer simulations show broad foreland-dipping plastic strain band forms surface near topographic inflection produced previous ramp strain band migrates towards rigid base plastic strain preferentially concentrated thrust ramp subsequent ramps develop toward foreland similar fashion syntectonic erosion deposition may strongly control location thrust ramps enhancing removing surface point initiation
