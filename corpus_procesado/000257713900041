properties gamma-ray burst progenitor stars 
determined basic properties stars produce spectacular gamma-ray bursts end lives assumed accretion outer portion stellar core central black hole fuels prompt emission fall-back accretion stellar envelope later produce plateau x-ray light curve seen bursts using x-ray data three bursts estimated radius stellar core similar to1- x cm stellar envelope similar to1 x cm density profile envelope fairly shallow rho similar r- rho density r distance center explosion rotation speeds core envelope similar similar local keplerian speed respectively
