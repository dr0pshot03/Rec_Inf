antagonistic actions ecdysone insulins determine final size drosophila 
animals coordinate growth maturation reach final size shape insects insulin family molecules control growth metabolism whereas pulses steroid hydroxyecdysone 20e initiate major developmental transitions show 20e signaling also negatively controls animal growth rates impeding general insulin signaling involving localization transcription factor dfoxo transcription translation inhibitor 4e-bp also demonstrate larval fat body equivalent vertebrate liver key relay element ecdysone-dependent growth inhibition hence ecdysone counteracts growth-promoting action insulins thus forming humoral regulatory loop determines organismal size
