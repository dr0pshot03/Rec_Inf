secondary active transport mediated prokaryotic homologue clc cl channels 
clc cl channels make large molecular family ubiquitous respect organisms cell types eukaryotes channels fulfill numerous biological roles requiring gated anion conductance regulating skeletal muscle excitability facilitating endosomal acidification h+ atpases prokaryotes clc functions unknown except escherichia coli clc ec1 protein promotes h+ extrusion activated extreme acid-resistance response common enteric bacteria recently high-resolution structure clc ec1 solved x-ray crystallography primal prokaryotic clc structure productively guided understanding gating anion permeation extensively studied eukaryotic clc channels now show bacterial homologue ion channel rather h+-cl exchange transporter molecular architecture can support two fundamentally different transport mechanisms seems structural boundary separating channels transporters clear cut generally thought
