functional genomic analysis cell division c-elegans using rnai genes chromosome iii 
genome sequencing projects generate wealth information; however ultimate goal projects accelerate identification biological function genes creates need comprehensive studies fill gap sequence function report results functional genomic screen identify genes required cell division caenorhabditis elegans inhibited expression similar % similar to2300 predicted open reading frames chromosome iii using rna-mediated interference rnai using vivo time-lapse differential interference contrast microscopy assay identified genes similar to6% necessary distinct cellular processes early embryos results indicate genes represent genes chromosome iii required proper cell division c elegans embryos complete data set including sample time-lapse recordings deposited open access database found similar % genes associated differential interference contrast phenotype clear orthologues eukaryotes indicating screen provides putative gene functions species well
