contribution anthropogenic natural sources atmospheric methane variability 
methane important greenhouse gas atmospheric concentration nearly tripled since pre-industrial times growth rate atmospheric methane determined balance surface emissions photochemical destruction hydroxyl radical major atmospheric oxidant remarkably growth rate decreased markedly since early 1990s level methane remained relatively constant since leading downward revision projected influence global temperatures large fluctuations growth rate atmospheric methane also observed one year next causes remain uncertain- quantify processes controlled variations methane emissions using inversion model atmospheric transport chemistry results indicate wetland emissions dominated inter-annual variability methane sources whereas fire emissions played smaller role except el nino event top-down estimates changes wetland fire emissions good agreement independent estimates based remote sensing information biogeochemical models longer timescales results show decrease atmospheric methane growth 1990s caused decline anthropogenic emissions since however indicate anthropogenic emissions methane risen effect increase growth rate atmospheric methane masked coincident decrease wetland emissions atmospheric methane levels may increase near future wetland emissions return mean 1990s levels
