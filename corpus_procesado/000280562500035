real-time observation valence electron motion 
superposition quantum states drives motion atomic subatomic scales energy spacing states dictating speed motion case electrons residing outer valence shells atoms molecules separated electronvolt energies means valence electron motion occurs subfemtosecond few-femtosecond timescale fs - s absence complete measurements motion can characterized terms complex quantity density matrix report attosecond pump-probe measurement density matrix valence electrons atomic krypton ions1 generate ions controlled few-cycle laser field2 probe spectrally resolved absorption attosecond extreme-ultraviolet pulse3 allows us observe real time subfemtosecond motion valence electrons multifemtosecond time span able completely characterize quantum mechanical electron motion determine degree coherence specimen ensemble although present study uses simple prototypical open system attosecond transient absorption spectroscopy applicable molecules solid-state materials reveal elementary electron motions control physical chemical biological properties processes
