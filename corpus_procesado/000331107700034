quantum error correction solid-state hybrid spin register 
error correction important classical quantum computation decoherence caused inevitable interaction quantum bits environment leads dephasing even relaxation correction concomitant errors therefore fundamental requirement scalable quantum computation- although algorithms error correction known time experimental realizations scarce- show quantum error correction heterogeneous solid-state spin system- demonstrate joint initialization projective readout fast local non-local gate operations can achieved diamond spin systems even ambient conditions high-fidelity initialization whole spin register per cent single-shot readout multiple individual nuclear spins achieved using ancillary electron spin nitrogen-vacancy defect implementation novel non-local gate generic electron-nuclear quantum register allows preparation entangled states three nuclear spins fidelities exceeding per cent techniques demonstrate three-qubit phase-flip error correction using optimal control operations achieve fidelities approaching needed fault-tolerant quantum operation thus paving way large-scale quantum computation besides use diamond spin systems techniques can used improve scaling quantum networks relying phosphorus silicon quantum dots silicon carbide rare-earth ions solids
