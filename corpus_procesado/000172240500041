confinement effect dipole-dipole interactions nanofluids 
intermolecular dipole-dipole interactions thought average zero gases liquids result rapid molecular motion leads sharp nuclear magnetic resonance lines recent papers shown small residual couplings survive motional averaging magnetization nonuniform nonspherical show much larger qualitatively different intermolecular dipolar interaction remains nanogases nanoliquids: effect confinement dipolar coupling characterizes interactions identical spin pairs depends shape orientation respect external magnetic field volume gas/liquid container nanoscale effect useful determination nanostructures unique applications exploration quantum space
