influence support surface rearrangements bimetallic nanoparticles real catalysts 
catalysts used heterogeneous processes usually composed metal nanoparticles dispersed high-surface-area support recent years near-ambient pressure techniques allowed catalyst characterization operating conditions overcoming pressure gap effect however use model systems may truly represent changes occur real catalysts so-called material gap effect supports can play important role catalytic process providing new active sites may strongly affect physical chemical properties metal nanoparticles used near-ambient pressure x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy show surface rearrangement bimetallic rhodium-palladium nanoparticles working conditions ethanol steam reforming real catalysts strongly influenced presence reducible ceria support
