demography dietary restriction death drosophila 
dietary restriction dr increases life-span organisms yeast mammals presumably slowing accumulation aging-related damage show drosophila dr extends life-span entirely reducing short-term risk death two days application dr age first time previously fully fed flies likely die flies age subjected long-term dr dr mammals may also reduce short-term risk death hence dr instigated age generate full reversal mortality
