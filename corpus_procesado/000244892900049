ubiquitin ligase transfers preformed polyubiquitin chains conjugating enzyme substrate 
eukaryotic cells many short-lived proteins conjugated lys48-linked ubiquitin chains degraded proteasome ubiquitination requires activating enzyme e1 conjugating enzyme e2 ligase e3 ubiquitin ligases use either hect homologous e6-associated protein c terminus ring really interesting new gene domain catalyse polyubiquitination mechanism e3 catalysis poorly defined dissect process using mouse ube2g2 e2 identical amino acid level human ube2g2 human gp78 e3 endoplasmic reticulum er-associated conjugating system essential degradation misfolded er proteins demonstrate expressing recombinant proteins escherichia coli ube2g2/gp78-mediated polyubiquitination involves preassembly lys48-linked ubiquitin chains catalytic cysteine ube2g2 growth ube2g2-anchored ubiquitin chains seems mediated aminolysis-based transfer reaction two ube2g2 molecules carries ubiquitin moiety active site intriguingly polyubiquitination substrate can achieved transferring preassembled ubiquitin chains ube2g2 lysine residue substrate
