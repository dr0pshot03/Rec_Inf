kilonova associated short-duration gamma-ray burst grb130603b
short-duration gamma-ray bursts intense flashes cosmic gamma-rays lasting less two seconds whose origin unclear favoured hypothesis produced relativistic jet created merger two compact stellar objects specifically two neutron stars neutron star black hole supported indirect evidence properties host galaxies unambiguous confirmation model still lacking mergers kind also expected create significant quantities neutron-rich radioactive species whose decay result faint transient known kilonova days following burst- indeed speculated mechanism may predominant source stable r-process elements universe recent calculations suggest much kilonova energy appear near-infrared spectral range high optical opacity created heavy r-process elements- report optical near-infrared observations provide strong evidence event accompanying short-duration gamma-ray burst grb130603b simplest interpretation data correct confirms compact-object mergers progenitors short-duration gamma-ray bursts sites significant production r-process elements also suggests kilonovae offer alternative unbeamed electromagnetic signature promising sources direct detection gravitational waves
