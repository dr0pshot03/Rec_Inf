binary millisecond pulsar discovery via gamma-ray pulsations 
millisecond pulsars old neutron stars spun accreting matter companion star can reach high rotation rates hundreds revolutions per second now recycled rotation-powered pulsars detected spin-modulated radio emission computing-intensive blind search gamma-ray data fermi large area telescope partial constraints optical data detected -millisecond pulsar psr j1311- unambiguously explains formerly unidentified gamma-ray source decade-long enigma confirming previous conjectures pulsar circular orbit orbital period minutes shortest spin-powered pulsar binary ever found
