frequency-modulated nuclear localization bursts coordinate gene regulation 
yeast transcription factor crz1 dephosphorylated translocates nucleus response extracellular calcium show using time lapse microscopy crz1 exhibits short bursts nuclear localization typically lasting min occur stochastically individual cells propagate expression downstream genes strikingly calcium concentration controls frequency duration localization bursts using analytic model also show frequency modulation bursts ensures proportional expression multiple target genes across wide dynamic range expression levels independent promoter characteristics experimentally confirm theory natural synthetic crz1 target promoters another stress response transcription factor msn2 exhibits similar largely uncorrelated localization bursts calcium stress suggesting frequency modulation regulation localization bursts may general control strategy used cell coordinate multi gene responses external signals
