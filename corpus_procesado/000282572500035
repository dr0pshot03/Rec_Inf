influence solar spectral variations radiative forcing climate
thermal structure composition atmosphere determined fundamentally incoming solar irradiance radiation ultraviolet wavelengths dissociates atmospheric molecules initiating chains chemical reactions-specifically producing stratospheric ozone-and providing major source heating middle atmosphere radiation visible near-infrared wavelengths mainly reaches warms lower atmosphere earths surface thus spectral composition solar radiation crucial determining atmospheric structure well surface temperature follows response atmosphere variations solar irradiance depends spectrum daily measurements solar spectrum mu m mu m made spectral irradiance monitor sim instrument solar radiation climate experiment sorce satellite since april revealed declining phase solar cycle four six times larger decline ultraviolet predicted basis previous understanding reduction partially compensated total solar output increase radiation visible wavelengths show spectral changes appear led significant decline stratospheric ozone altitude km increase altitude results simulated radiative-photochemical model consistent contemporaneous measurements ozone aura-mls satellite although short time period makes precise attribution solar effects difficult also show using sim data solar radiative forcing surface climate phase solar activity currently insufficient observational evidence validate spectral variations observed sim fully characterize solar cycles findings raise possibility effects solar variability temperature throughout atmosphere may contrary current expectations
