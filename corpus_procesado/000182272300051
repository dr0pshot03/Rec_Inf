adaptation core mechanisms generate cell polarity
cell polarity defined asymmetry cell shape protein distributions cell functions characteristic single-cell organisms including yeast bacteria cells tissues multi-cell organisms epithelia worms flies mammals diversity raises several questions: different cell types use different mechanisms generate polarity polarity signalled cells react signal structural polarity translated specialized functions analysis evolutionarily diverse cell types reveals cell-surface landmarks adapt core pathways cytoskeleton assembly protein transport generate cell polarity
