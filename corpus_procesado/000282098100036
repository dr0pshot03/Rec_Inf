optical clocks relativity 
observers relative motion different gravitational potentials measure disparate clock rates predictions relativity previously observed atomic clocks high velocities large changes elevation observed time dilation relative speeds less meters per second comparing two optical atomic clocks connected meter length optical fiber can now also detect time dilation due change height near earths surface less meter technique may extended field geodesy applications geophysics hydrology well space-based tests fundamental physics
