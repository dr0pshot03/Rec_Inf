direct observation growth collapse bose-einstein condensate attractive interactions 
quantum theory predicts bose-einstein condensation spatially homogeneous gas attractive interactions precluded conventional phase transition either liquid solid confined trap however condensate can form provided occupation number exceed limiting value stability limit determined balance self-attractive fortes repulsion arises position-momentum uncertainty conditions spatial confinement near stability limit self-attraction can overwhelm repulsion causing condensate collapse- growth condensate therefore punctuated intermittent collapses triggered either macroscopic quantum tunnelling thermal fluctuation previous observations growth collapse dynamics hampered stochastic nature mechanisms report direct observations growth subsequent collapse li condensate attractive interactions using phase-contrast imaging success measurement lies ability reduce stochasticity dynamics controlling initial number condensate atoms using two-photon transition diatomic molecular state
