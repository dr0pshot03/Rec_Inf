high critical currents iron-clad superconducting mgb2 wires 
technically useful bulk superconductors must high transport critical current densities jc operating temperatures also require normal metal cladding provide parallel electrical conduction thermal stabilization mechanical protection generally brittle superconductor cores recent discovery superconductivity k magnesium diboride mgb21 presents new possibility significant bulk applications2- many critical issues relevant practical wires remain unresolved particular mgb2 mechanically hard brittle therefore amenable drawing desired fine-wire geometry even synthesis moderately dense bulk mgb2 attaining k superconductivity challenge volatility reactivity magnesium report successful fabrication dense metal-clad superconducting mgb2 wires demonstrate transport jc excess cm- k iron-clad fabrication technique takes place ambient pressure yet produces dense mgb2 little loss stoichiometry searching suitable cladding material found materials dramatically reduced critical current showing although mgb2 show weak-link effect characteristic high-tc superconductors contamination result weak-link-like behaviour
