tandem riboswitch architectures exhibit complex gene control functions
riboswitches structured rnas typically located untranslated regions bacterial mrnas bind metabolites control gene expression riboswitches sense one metabolite function simple genetic switches however found region bacillus clausii mete messenger rna includes two riboswitches respond s-adenosylmethionine coenzyme b- tandem arrangement yields composite gene control system functions two-input boolean logic gate findings discovery additional tandem riboswitch architectures reveal simple rna elements can assembled make sophisticated genetic decisions without involving protein factors
