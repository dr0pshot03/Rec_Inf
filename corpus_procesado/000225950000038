reduced competition altered feeding behavior among marine snails mass extinction 
extinction may alter competitive interactions among surviving species affecting subsequent recovery evolution processes remain poorly understood analysis predation traces produced shell-drilling muricid snails bivalve prey reveals species interactions substantially different plio-pleistocene mass extinction westerm atlantic muricids edge wall-drilled prey pliocene pleistocene recent snails attacked prey shell wait experiments living animals suggest intense competition induces muricid snails attack shell edges pliocene predators therefore probably competed resources intensely post-extinction counterparts
