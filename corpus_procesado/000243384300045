black hole globular cluster 
globular star clusters contain thousands millions old stars packed within region tens light years across high stellar densities make probable member stars will interact collide accordingly considerable debate whether black holes exist star clusters- theoretical work suggests dynamical processes densest inner regions globular clusters may lead formation black holes similar solar masses numerical simulations instead predict stellar interactions will eject black holes form globular clusters report x-ray signature accreting black hole globular cluster associated giant elliptical galaxy ngc virgo cluster object x-ray luminosity x erg s- rules object black hole old stellar population x-ray luminosity varies factor seven hours excludes possibility object several neutron stars superposed
