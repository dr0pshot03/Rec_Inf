bergmann glial ampa receptors required fine motor coordination
impact glial neurotransmitter receptors vivo still elusive cerebellum bergmann glial bg cells express alpha-amino--hydroxy--methyl--isoxazolepropionic acid ampa-type glutamate receptors ampars composed exclusively glua1 and/or glua4 subunits use conditional gene inactivation found majority cerebellar glua1/a4-type ampars expressed bg cells young mice deletion bg ampars resulted retraction glial appendages purkinje cell pc synapses increased amplitude duration evoked pc currents delayed formation glutamatergic synapses adult mice ampar inactivation also caused retraction glial processes physiological structural changes accompanied behavioral impairments fine motor coordination thus bg ampars essential optimize synaptic integration cerebellar output function throughout life
