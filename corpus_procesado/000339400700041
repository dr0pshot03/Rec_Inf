imaging charge transfer iodomethane upon x-ray photoabsorption
studies charge transfer often hampered difficulties determining charge localization given time used ultrashort x-ray free-electron laser pulses image charge rearrangement dynamics within gas-phase iodomethane molecules dissociation induced synchronized near-infrared nir laser pulse inner-shell photoionization creates positive charge initially localized iodine atom map electron transfer methyl iodine fragments function interatomic separation set nir-x-ray delay observe signatures electron transfer distances angstroms show realistic estimate effective spatial range can obtained classical over-the-barrier model presented technique applicable spatiotemporal imaging charge transfer dynamics wide range molecular systems
