two-color single-photon photoinitiation photoinhibition subdiffraction photolithography
controlling reducing developed region initiated photoexposure one fundamental goals optical lithography demonstrate two-color irradiation scheme whereby initiating species generated single-photon absorption one wavelength inhibiting species generated single-photon absorption second independent wavelength co-irradiation second wavelength thus reduces polymerization rate delaying gelation material facilitating enhanced spatial control polymerization appropriate overlapping two beams produces structures feature sizes monomer conversions otherwise unobtainable use single two-photon absorption photopolymerization additionally generated inhibiting species rapidly recombine irradiation second wavelength ceases allowing fast sequential exposures limited memory effects material thus enabling fabrication complex two three-dimensional structures
