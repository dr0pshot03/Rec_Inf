methane clouds lakes fluvial features saturns moon titan observed moist high latitudes- tropics nearly devoid convective clouds shown abundance wind-carved surface features like dunes presence small-scale channels dry riverbeds near equator observed huygens probe latitudes thought incapable supporting convection- thus strong rain suggested due geological seepage mechanisms related precipitation report presence bright transient tropospheric clouds tropical latitudes find initial pulse cloud activity generated planetary waves instigated cloud activity latitudes across titan cloud-free least several years observations show convective pulses one latitude can trigger short-term convection latitudes even generally considered capable supporting convection may also explain presence methane-carved rivers channels near huygens landing site
