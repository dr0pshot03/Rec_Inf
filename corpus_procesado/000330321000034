global cloud map nearest known brown dwarf
brown dwarfs-substellar bodies massive planets massive enough initiate sustained hydrogen fusion powers self-luminous stars-are born hot slowly cool age cool kelvin liquid crystalline particles composed calcium aluminates silicates iron condense atmospheric dust disappears still cooler temperatures around kelvin models explain dust dispersal include abrupt sinking entire cloud deck deep unobservable atmosphere breakup cloud scattered patches seen jupiter saturn however hitherto observations brown dwarfs limited globally integrated measurements can reveal surface inhomogeneities unambiguously resolve surface features report two-dimensional map brown dwarfs surface allows identification large-scale bright dark features indicative patchy clouds monitoring suggests characteristic timescale evolution global weather patterns approximately one day
