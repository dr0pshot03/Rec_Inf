antigenic variation giardia lamblia regulated rna interference 
giardia lamblia also called giardia intestinalis one common intestinal parasites humans evade hosts immune response giardia undergoes antigenic variation process allows parasite develop chronic recurrent infections repertoire similar variant specific surface protein vsp coding genes giardia expresses one vsp surface parasite particular time spontaneously switches different vsp unknown mechanisms show regulation vsp expression involves system comprising rna dependent rna polymerase dicer argonaute known components rna interference machinery clones expressing single surface antigen efficiently transcribe several vsp genes accumulate transcripts encoding vsp expressed detection antisense rnas corresponding silenced vsp genes small rnas silenced expressed vsp implicate rna interference pathway antigenic variation remarkably silencing dicer rna dependent rna polymerase leads change single multiple vsp expression individual parasites
