earthquake nucleation transient deformations caused m denali alaska earthquake
permanent dynamic transient stress changes inferred trigger earthquakes usually orders magnitude smaller stresses relaxed earthquakes implying triggering occurs critically stressed faults- triggered seismicity rate increases may therefore likely occur areas loading rates highest elevated pore pressures perhaps facilitated high-temperature fluids reduce frictional stresses promote failure- show magnitude m denali alaska earthquake triggered widespread seismicity rate increases throughout british columbia western united states dynamic triggering seismic waves enhanced directions rupture directivity focuses radiated energy verify using seismic new high-sample gps recordings denali mainshock observations comparable scale triggering caused m landers california earthquake demonstrate landers triggering reflect peculiarity region earthquake however rate increases triggered denali earthquake occurred areas obviously tectonically active implying even areas low ambient stressing rates faults may still critically stressed dynamic triggering may ubiquitous unpredictable
