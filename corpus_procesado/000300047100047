molecular mos2 edge site mimic catalytic hydrogen generation 
inorganic solids important class catalysts often derive activity sparse active sites structurally distinct inactive bulk rationally optimizing activity therefore beholden challenges studying active sites molecular detail report molecule mimics structure proposed triangular active edge site fragments molybdenum disulfide mos2 widely used industrial catalyst shown promise low-cost alternative platinum electrocatalytic hydrogen production leveraging robust coordination environment pentapyridyl ligand synthesized structurally characterized well-defined mo-iv-disulfide complex upon electrochemical reduction can catalytically generate hydrogen acidic organic media well acidic water
