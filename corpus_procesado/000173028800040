resource-based niches provide basis plant species diversity dominance arctic tundra 
ecologists long intrigued ways co-occurring species divide limiting resources resource partitioning niche differentiation may promote species diversity reducing competition although resource partitioning important determinant species diversity composition animal communities importance structuring plant communities difficult resolve due mainly difficulties studying plants compete belowground resources provide evidence n--tracer field experiment showing plant species nitrogen-limited arctic tundra community differentiated timing depth chemical form nitrogen uptake species dominance strongly correlated uptake available soil nitrogen forms productive species used abundant nitrogen forms less productive species used less abundant forms knowledge first documentation composition plant community related partitioning differentially available forms single limiting resource
