cell-to-cell spread hiv permits ongoing replication despite antiretroviral therapy 
latency ongoing replication proposed explain drug-insensitive human immunodeficiency virus hiv reservoir maintained antiretroviral therapy explore novel mechanism ongoing hiv replication face antiretroviral drugs propose model whereby multiple infections per cell lead reduced sensitivity drugs without requiring drug-resistant mutations experimentally validate model using multiple infections per cell cell-free hiv presence drug tenofovir examine drug sensitivity cell-to-cell spread hiv- mode hiv transmission can lead multiple infection events per target cell- infections originating cell-free virus decrease strongly presence antiretrovirals tenofovir efavirenz whereas infections involving cell-to-cell spread markedly less sensitive drugs reduction sensitivity sufficient keep multiple rounds infection terminating presence drugs examine replication cell-to-cell spread presence clinical drug concentrations using stochastic infection model find replication intermittent without substantial accumulation mutations cell-to-cell spread properties vivo may adverse consequences immune system- lead therapy failure individuals risk factors potentially contribute viral persistence hence barrier curing hiv infection
