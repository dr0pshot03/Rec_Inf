simple multidimensional approach high-throughput discovery catalytic reactions
transition metal complexes catalyze many important reactions employed medicine materials science energy production although high-throughput methods discovery catalysts mirror related approaches discovery medicinally active compounds focus much attention methods sufficiently general accessible typical synthetic laboratories adopted widely report method evaluate broad range catalysts potential coupling reactions use simple laboratory equipment specifically screen array catalysts ligands diverse mixture substrates use mass spectrometry identify reaction products design exceed mass single substrate method discovered copper-catalyzed alkyne hydroamination two nickel-catalyzed hydroarylation reactions displays excellent functional-group tolerance
