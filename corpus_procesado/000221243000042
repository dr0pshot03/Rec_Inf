dioxygen binds end-on mononuclear copper precatalytic enzyme complex
copper active sites play major role enzymatic activation dioxygen trapped copper-dioxygen complex enzyme peptidylglycine-alpha-hydroxylating monooxygenase phm freezing protein crystals soaked slow substrate ascorbate presence oxygen x-ray crystal structure precatalytic complex determined -angstrom resolution shows oxygen binds one coppers enzyme end-on geometry given structure likely dioxygen directly involved electron transfer hydrogen abstraction steps phm reaction insights may apply copper oxygen-activating enzymes dopamine beta-monooxygenase design biomimetic complexes
