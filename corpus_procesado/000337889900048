lassa virus entry requires trigger-induced receptor switch 
lassa virus spreads rodent humans can lead lethal hemorrhagic fever despite broad tropism chicken cells reported years ago resist infection found lassa virus readily engaged cell-surface receptor a-dystroglycan avian cells virus entry susceptible species involved ph-dependent switch intracellular receptor lysosome-resident protein lamp1 iterative haploid screens revealed sialyltransferase st3gal4 required interaction virus glycoprotein lamp1 single glycosylated residue lamp1 present susceptible species absent birds essential interaction lassa virus envelope protein subsequent infection resistance lamp1-deficient mice lassa virus highlights relevance receptor switch vivo
