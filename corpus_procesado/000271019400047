ptp sigma receptor chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan inhibitor neural regeneration 
chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans cspgs present barrier axon regeneration however specific receptor inhibitory effect cspgs identified showed transmembrane protein tyrosine phosphatase ptp sigma binds high affinity neural cspgs binding involves chondroitin sulfate chains specific site first immunoglobulin-like domain ptp sigma culture ptp sigma-/- neurons show reduced inhibition cspg ptp sigma fusion protein probe can detect cognate ligands up-regulated specifically neural lesion sites spinal cord injury ptp sigma gene disruption enhanced ability axons penetrate regions containing cspg results indicate ptp sigma can act receptor cspgs may provide new therapeutic approaches neural regeneration
