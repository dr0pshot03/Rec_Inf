comparison hanbury brown-twiss effect bosons fermions 
fifty years ago hanbury brown twiss hbt discovered photon bunching light emitted chaotic source highlighting importance two-photon correlations stimulating development modern quantum optics quantum interpretation bunching relies constructive interference amplitudes involving two indistinguishable photons additive character intimately linked bose nature photons advances atom cooling detection led observation full characterization atomic analogue hbt effect bosonic atoms- contrast fermions reveal antibunching effect tendency avoid antibunching fermions associated destructive two-particle interference related pauli principle forbidding one identical fermion occupy quantum state report experimental comparison fermionic bosonic hbt effects apparatus using two different isotopes helium: fermion boson ordinary attractive repulsive interactions atoms negligible therefore contrasting bunching antibunching behaviour observe can fully attributed different quantum statistics atomic species results show atom atom correlation measurements can used reveal details spatial density momentum correlations atomic ensemble also enable direct observation phase effects linked quantum statistics many-body system may facilitate study exotic situations
