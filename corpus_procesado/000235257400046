resolving motional modes code rna adaptation 
using domain elongation strategy decoupled internal motions rna overall rotational diffusion allowed us site-specifically resolve manifold motional modes two regulatory rnas hiv use nuclear magnetic resonance spin relaxation methods base sugar librations vary picosecond time scale occur within helical domains move collectively diffusion-limited nanosecond time scales pivot points short functionally important highly mobile internal loops spontaneous changes rna conformation correlate quantitatively follow adaptive recognition diverse targets thus ligands may stabilize existing rna conformations rather inducing new ones
