light interference single atoms mirror images 
single atom emitting single photons fundamental source light characteristics light depend strongly environment atom example atom placed two mirrors total rate spectral composition spontaneous emission can modified effects observed using various systems: molecules deposited mirrors dye molecules optical cavity atom beam traversing two-mirror optical resonator- single atoms traversing microwave cavity- single trapped electron related equally fundamental phenomenon optical interaction two atoms kind separation comparable emission wavelength situation light emitted one atom may reabsorbed leading cooperative processes emission observe phenomena high visibility using one two single atoms collimating lens mirror recording individual photons scattered atoms experiments highlight intimate connection one-atom two-atom effects allow continuous observation using apparatus
