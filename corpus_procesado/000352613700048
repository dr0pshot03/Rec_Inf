mountain gorilla genomes reveal impact long-term population decline inbreeding
mountain gorillas endangered great ape subspecies prominent focus conservation yet know little genomic diversity evolutionary past sequenced whole genomes multiple wild individuals compared genomes four gorilla subspecies found two eastern subspecies experienced prolonged population decline past years resulting low genetic diversity increased overall burden deleterious variation recent decline mountain gorilla population led extensive inbreeding individuals typically homozygous % sequence leading purging severely deleterious recessive mutations population discuss causes decline consequences future survival
