different substrate-dependent transition states active site ribosome 
active site ribosome peptidyl transferase centre catalyses two reactions namely peptide bond formation peptidyl-trna aminoacyl-trna well release-factor-dependent hydrolysis peptidyl-trna unlike peptide bond formation peptide release strongly impaired mutations nucleotides within active site particular base exchanges position a2602 refs -oh group a76 peptidyl-trna substrate seems key role peptide release3 according computational analysis4 -oh may take part concerted proton shuttle leaving group protonated analogy similar current models peptide bond formation4- report kinetic solvent isotope effects proton inventories reaction rates measured buffers increasing content deuterated water d2o two reactions catalysed active site escherichia coli ribosome transition state release factor rf2-dependent hydrolysis reaction characterized rate-limiting formation single strong hydrogen bond finding argues concerted proton shuttle transition state hydrolysis reaction comparison proton inventory peptide bond formation indicates rate-limiting formation three hydrogen bonds equal contributions consistent concerted eight-membered proton shuttle transition state5 thus ribosome supports different rate-limiting transition states two reactions take place peptidyl transferase centre
