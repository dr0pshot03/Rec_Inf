bacterial chromatin organization h-ns protein unravelled using dual dna manipulation
prokaryotic eukaryotic organisms contain dna bridging proteins can regulatory architectural functions molecular mechanical details proteins hard obtain particular involve non specific interactions bacterial nucleoid consists hundreds dna loops shaped part non specific dna bridging proteins histone-like nucleoid structuring protein h ns leucine responsive regulatory protein lrp smc structural maintenance chromosomes proteins developed optical tweezers instrument can independently handle two dna molecules allows systematic investigation protein mediated dna dna interactions use technique investigate abundant non specific nucleoid associated protein h ns show h ns dynamically organized two dna molecules register helical pitch optical tweezers also allow us carry dynamic force spectroscopy non specific dna binding proteins thereby determine energy landscape h ns dna interaction results explain bacterial nucleoid can effectively compacted organized dynamic nature accessible dna tracking motor enzymes finally experimental approach widely applicable dna bridging proteins well complex dna interactions involving multiple dna molecules
