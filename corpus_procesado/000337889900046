formation temperatures thermogenic biogenic methane
methane important greenhouse gas energy resource generated dominantly methanogens low temperatures breakdown organic molecules high temperatures however methane-formation temperatures nature often poorly constrained measured formation temperatures thermogenic biogenic methane using clumped isotope technique thermogenic gases yield formation temperatures degrees degrees c within nominal gas window biogenic gases yield formation temperatures consistent comparatively lower-temperature formational environments < degrees c systems gases migrated proxies gas-generation temperature yield ambiguous results methane clumped-isotope temperatures distinguish among allow independent tests possible gas-formation models
