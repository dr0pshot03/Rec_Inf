phosphorylation sld2 sld3 cyclin-dependent kinases promotes dna replication budding yeast
cyclin-dependent kinases cdks drive major cell cycle events including initiation chromosomal dna replication identified two s phase cdk s-cdk phosphorylation sites budding yeast sld3 protein together essential dna replication show phosphorylated sites bind amino-terminal brct repeats dpb11 sld3 dpb11 fusion construct bypasses requirement sld3 phosphorylation n-terminal brct repeats dpb11 co-expression fusion phospho-mimicking mutant second essential cdk substrate sld2 promotes dna replication absence s-cdk therefore sld2 sld3 minimal set s-cdk targets required dna replication dna replication cells lacking g1 phase cdk g1-cdk required expression cdc7 kinase regulatory subunit dbf4 well sld2 sld3 bypass results help explain g1 s-cdks promote dna replication yeast
