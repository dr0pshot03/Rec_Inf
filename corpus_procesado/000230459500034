extrasolar giant planet close triple-star system
hot jupiters gas-giant planets orbiting periods days around sun-like stars believed form disk gas condensed matter beyond similar astronomical units au sun earth distance parent star distances exists sufficient amount solid material produce core capable capturing enough gas form giant planet subsequently migrate inward present close orbits report detection unusual hot jupiter orbiting primary star triple stellar system hd planet orbital period days minimum mass times jupiter primary stars mass times sun m- secondary star binary stellar system orbits primary average distance au eccentricity mass secondary pair m- close massive secondary truncated disk around primary radius similar au ref might heated temperatures high enough prohibit giant-planet formation leaving origin planet unclear
