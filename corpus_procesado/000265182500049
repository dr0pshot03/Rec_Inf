unusual mechanism thymidylate biosynthesis organisms containing thyx gene
biosynthesis dna base thymine depends activity enzyme thymidylate synthase catalyse methylation uracil moiety -deoxyuridine--monophosphate known thymidylate synthases rely active site residue enzyme activate -deoxyuridine--monophosphate functionality demonstrated classical thymidylate synthases including human thymidylate synthase instrumental mechanism-based inhibition enzymes report example thymidylate biosynthesis occurs without enzymatic nucleophile unusual biosynthetic pathway occurs organisms containing thyx gene codes flavin-dependent thymidylate synthase fdts present several human pathogens- findings indicate putative active site nucleophile required fdts catalysis alternative nucleophilic residues capable serving function can identified instead findings suggest hydride equivalent proton two electrons transferred reduced flavin cofactor directly uracil ring followed isomerization intermediate form product -deoxythymidine--monophosphate observations indicate different chemical cascade classical thymidylate synthases known biological methylation findings chemical mechanism proposed together available structural data suggest selective inhibition fdtss little effect human thymine biosynthesis feasible several human pathogens depend fdts dna biosynthesis unique mechanism makes attractive target antibiotic drugs
