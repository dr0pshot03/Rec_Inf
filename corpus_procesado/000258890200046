single-nucleotide mutation rate increases close insertions/deletions eukaryotes 
mutation hotspots commonly observed genomic sequences certain human disease loci- general mechanisms formation remain elusive- investigate distribution single nucleotide changes around insertions/ deletions indels six independent genome comparisons including primates rodents fruitfly rice yeast genomic comparisons nucleotide divergence d substantially elevated surrounding indels decreases monotonically near-background levels several hundred bases d significantly correlated size abundance nearby indels comparisons closely related species derived nucleotide substitutions surrounding indels occur significantly greater numbers lineage containing indel one containing ancestral non indel allele holds within species single nucleotide mutations surrounding polymorphic indels propose heterozygosity indel mutagenic surrounding sequences use yeast genome wide polymorphism data estimate increase mutation rate consistency patterns within species suggests indel associated substitution general mutational mechanism
