avian z-linked gene dmrt1 required male sex determination chicken 
sex birds chromosomally based mammals sex chromosomes different mechanism avian sex determination long-standing mystery- chicken birds homogametic sex male zz heterogametic sex female zw two hypotheses proposed mechanism avian sex determination w female chromosome may carry dominant-acting ovary determinant- alternatively dosage z-linked gene may mediate sex determination two doses required male development zz strong candidate avian sex-determinant dosage hypothesis conserved z-linked gene dmrt1 doublesex mab--related transcription factor - used rna interference rnai knock dmrt1 early chicken embryos reduction dmrt1 protein expression ovo leads feminization embryonic gonads genetically male zz embryos affected males show partial sex reversal characterized feminization gonads feminized left gonad shows female-like histology disorganized testis cords decline testicular marker sox9 ovarian marker aromatase ectopically activated feminized right gonad shows variable loss dmrt1 ectopic aromatase activation suggesting differential sensitivity dmrt1 left right gonads germ cells also show female pattern distribution feminized male gonads results indicate dmrt1 required testis determination chicken data support z dosage hypothesis avian sex determination
