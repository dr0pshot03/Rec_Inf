thymic origin intestinal alpha beta t cells revealed fate mapping ror gamma t+ cells
intestinal intraepithelial t lymphocytes iels likely play key role host mucosal immunity unlike t cells proposed differentiate local precursors rather thymocytes show iels expressing alphabeta t cell receptor derived precursors express rorgammat orphan nuclear hormone receptor detected immature cd4+ cd8+ thymocytes fetal lymphoid tissue-inducer lti cells lti-like cells crypto-patches within adult intestinal lamina propria using cell fate mapping found intestinal alphabeta t cells progeny cd4+ cd8+ thymocytes indicating adult intestine significant site alphabeta t cell development results suggest intestinal rorgammat+ cells local organizers mucosal lymphoid tissue
