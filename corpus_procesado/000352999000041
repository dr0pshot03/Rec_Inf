weakening summer circulation northern hemisphere mid-latitudes
rapid warming arctic influence mid-latitude circulation reducing poleward temperature gradient largest changes generally expected autumn winter whether significant changes occurred debated report significant weakening summer circulation detected three key dynamical quantities: zonal-mean zonal wind ii eddy kinetic energy eke iii amplitude fast-moving rossby waves weakening zonal wind explained reduction poleward temperature gradient changes rossby waves eke consistent regression analyses climate model projections changes seasonal cycle monthly heat extremes associated low eke thus observed weakening might contributed persistent heat waves recent summers
