hybridization electronic states quantum dots photon emission 
self-assembly semiconductor quantum dots opened new opportunities photonics quantum dots usually described artificial atoms electron hole confinement gives rise discrete energy levels picture can justified shell structure observed quantum dot filled either excitons bound electron hole pairs electrons discrete energy levels spectacularly exploited single photon sources use single quantum dot emitter- low temperatures artificial atom picture strengthened long coherence times excitons quantum dots- motivating application quantum dots quantum optics quantum information processing context excitons quantum dots already manipulated coherently- show quantum dots can also possess electronic states go far beyond artificial atom model states coherent hybridization localized quantum dot states extended continuum states: analogue atomic physics states generated emission photon quantum dot show new version anderson model describes interactions localized extended states can account observed hybridization
