functional consequences cki delta mutation causing familial advanced sleep phase syndrome
familial advanced sleep phase syndrome fasps human behavioural phenotype characterized early sleep times early-morning awakening first human mendelian circadian rhythm variant well-characterized shown result mutation phosphorylation site within casein kinase cki-binding domain human per2 gene gain deeper understanding mechanisms circadian rhythm regulation humans set identify mutations human subjects leading fasps report identification missense mutation t44a human cki delta gene results fasps mutant kinase decreased enzymatic activity vitro transgenic drosophila carrying human cki delta-t44a gene showed phenotype lengthened circadian period contrast transgenic mice carrying mutation shorter circadian period phenotype mimicking human fasps results show cki delta central component mammalian clock suggest mammalian fly clocks might different regulatory mechanisms despite highly conserved nature individual components
