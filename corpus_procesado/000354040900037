differential dna mismatch repair underlies mutation rate variation across human genome
cancer genome sequencing revealed considerable variation somatic mutation rates across human genome mutation rates elevated inheterochromatic late replicating regionsand reduced early replicating euchromatin- multiple mechanisms suggested underlie this- actual cause unknown identify variable dna mismatch repair mmr basis variation analysing similar million single-nucleotide variants genomes tumours show regional autosomal mutation rates megabase resolution largely stable across cancer types differences related changes replication timing gene expression however mutations arising inactivation mmr longer enriched late replicating heterochromatin relative early replicating euchromatin thus differential dna repair differential mutation supply primary cause large-scale regional mutation rate variation across human genome
