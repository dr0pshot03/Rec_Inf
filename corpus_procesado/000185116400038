constitutive display cryptic translation products mhc class molecules 
major histocompatibility complex mhc class molecules display tens thousands peptides cell surface derived virtually endogenous proteins inspection cytotoxic t cells ctls show normal mouse cells mhc molecules present peptide encoded "untranslated" region despite rarity peptide elicits ctl responses induces self-tolerance establishing immune surveillance extends well beyond conventional polypeptides furthermore translation cryptic peptide occurs previously unknown mechanism decodes cug initiation codon leucine rather canonical methionine
