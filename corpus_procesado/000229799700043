breakdown continuum models mechanical contacts 
forces acting within area atomic contact surfaces play central role friction adhesion forces traditionally calculated using continuum contact mechanics1 known break contact radius approaches atomic dimensions yet contact mechanics applied ever smaller lengths driven interest shrinking devices nano-metre scales23 creating nanostructured materials optimized mechanical properties34 understanding molecular origins macroscopic friction adhesion56 use molecular simulations test limits contact mechanics ideal conditions findings indicate atomic discreteness within bulk solids significant effect atomic-scale surface roughness always produced discrete atoms leads dramatic deviations continuum theory contact areas stresses may changed factor two whereas friction lateral contact stiffness change order magnitude variations likely affect continuum predictions many macroscopic rough surfaces studies78 show total contact area broken many separate regions small mean radius
