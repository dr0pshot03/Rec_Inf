batf3 deficiency reveals critical role cd8 alpha+ dendritic cells cytotoxic t cell immunity 
although vitro observations suggest cross presentation antigens mediated primarily cd8 alpha+ dendritic cells vivo analysis hampered lack systems selectively eliminate cell lineage show deletion transcription factor batf3 ablated development cd8 alpha+ dendritic cells allowing us examine role immunity vivo dendritic cells batf3-/- mice defective cross presentation batf3-/- mice lacked virus specific cd8+ t cell responses west nile virus importantly rejection highly immunogenic syngeneic tumors impaired batf3-/- mice results suggest important role cd8 alpha+ dendritic cells cross presentation responses viruses tumor rejection
