protein displacement dexh/d rna helicases without duplex unwinding
members dexh/d superfamily nucleic acid-activated nucleotide triphosphatases essential virtually aspects rna metabolism including pre-messenger rna splicing rna interference translation nucleocytoplasmic trafficking physiological substrates enzymes thought regions double-stranded rna several dexh/d proteins catalyze strand separation vitro rna helicases can also disrupt rna-protein interactions unclear whether activity coupled duplex unwinding demonstrate two unrelated dexh/d proteins catalyze protein displacement independently duplex unwinding therefore essential functions dexh/d proteins confined rna duplexes can exerted wide range ribonucleoprotein substrates
