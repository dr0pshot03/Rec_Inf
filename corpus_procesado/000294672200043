ribosome assembly factors prevent premature translation initiation 40s assembly intermediates 
ribosome assembly eukaryotes requires approximately essential assembly factors afs occurs ordered events initiate nucleolus culminate cytoplasm present electron cryo-microscopy cryo-em structure late cytoplasmic 40s ribosome assembly intermediate saccharomyces cerevisiae angstrom resolution obtained cryo-em reconstructions preribosomal complexes lacking individual components define positions seven afs bound intermediate late-binding afs positioned prevent step translation initiation pathway together obstruct binding sites initiation factors prevent opening messenger rna channel block 60s subunit joining disrupt decoding site redundant mechanisms probably ensure pre-40s particles enter translation pathway result rapid degradation
