structural mechanism ligand activation human gabab receptor
human gabab gamma-aminobutyric acid class b receptor g-protein-coupled receptor central inhibitory neurotransmission brain functions obligatory heterodimer subunits gbr1 gbr2 present crystal structures heterodimeric complex extracellular domains gbr1 gbr2 apo agonist-bound antagonist-bound forms apo antagonist-bound structures represent resting state receptor agonist-bound complex corresponds active state subunits adopt open conformation rest gbr1 closes agonist-induced receptor activation agonists antagonists anchored interdomain crevice gbr1 overlapping set residues antagonist confines gbr1 open conformation inactive state whereas agonist induces domain closure activation data reveal unique activation mechanism gabab receptor involves formation novel heterodimer interface subunits
