rational design structural functional nitric oxide reductase
protein design provides rigorous test knowledge proteins allows creation novel enzymes biotechnological applications whereas progress made designing proteins mimic native proteins structurally- difficult design functional proteins- comparison recent successes designing non-metalloproteins even challenging rationally design metalloproteins reproduce structure function native metalloenzymes- protein metal-binding sites much varied non-metal-containing sites terms different metal ion oxidation states preferred geometry metal ion ligand donor sets variability difficult predict metal-binding site properties silico many parameters force fields ill-defined therefore successful design structural functional metalloprotein greatly advance field protein design understanding enzymes report successful rational design structural functional model metalloprotein nitric oxide reductase introducing three histidines one glutamate predicted ligands active site distal pocket myoglobin crystal structure designed protein confirms minimized computer model contains haem/non-haem feb centre remarkably similar crystal structure designed protein also exhibits reduction activity models structure function offering insight active site glutamate required iron binding activity results show structural functional metalloproteins can rationally designed silico
