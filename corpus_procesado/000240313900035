structure h5n1 avian influenza neuraminidase suggests new opportunities drug design
worldwide spread h5n1 avian influenza raised concerns virus might acquire ability pass readily among humans cause pandemic two anti-influenza drugs currently used treat infected patients oseltamivir tamiflu zanamivir relenza target neuraminidase enzyme virus reports emergence drug resistance make development new anti-influenza molecules priority neuraminidases influenza type viruses form two genetically distinct groups: group contains n1 neuraminidase h5n1 avian virus group contains n2 n9 enzymes used structure-based design current drugs show x-ray crystallography two groups structurally distinct group neuraminidases contain cavity adjacent active sites closes ligand binding analysis suggests may possible exploit size location group cavity develop new anti-influenza drugs
