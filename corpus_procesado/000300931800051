alarmin interleukin- drives protective antiviral cd8+ t cell responses 
pathogen-associated molecular patterns decisively influence antiviral immune responses whereas contribution endogenous signals tissue damage also known damage-associated molecular patterns alarmins remains ill defined show interleukin- il- alarmin released necrotic cells necessary potent cd8+ t cell ctl responses replicating prototypic rna dna viruses mice il- signaled receptor activated ctls enhanced clonal expansion ctl-intrinsic fashion determined plurifunctional effector cell differentiation necessary virus control moreover recombinant il- augmented vaccine-induced ctl responses radio-resistant cells splenic t cell zone produced il- efficient ctl responses required il- radio-resistant cells hematopoietic cells thus alarmin release radio-resistant cells orchestrates protective antiviral ctl responses
