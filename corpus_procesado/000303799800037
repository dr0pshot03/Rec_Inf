patterning controlled cracking
crack formation drives material failure often regarded process avoided- however closer examination cracking phenomena revealed exquisitely intricate patterns spirals oscillating branched fracture paths fractal geometries demonstrate controlled initiation propagation termination variety channelled crack patterns film/substrate system- comprising silicon nitride thin film deposited silicon substrate using low-pressure chemical vapour deposition micro-notches etched silicon substrate concentrated stress crack initiation occurred spontaneously deposition silicon nitride layer reproducibly created three distinct crack morphologies-straight oscillatory orderly bifurcated stitchlike-through careful selection processing conditions parameters induced direction changes changing system parameters terminated propagation preformed multi-step crack stops believe patterning technique presents new opportunities nanofabrication offers starting point atomic-scale pattern formation difficult even current state-of-the-art nanofabrication methodologies
