generalized levy walks role chemokines migration effector cd8+ t cells 
chemokines central role regulating processes essential immune function t cells1- migration within lymphoid tissues targeting pathogens sites inflammation track t cells using multi-photon microscopy demonstrate chemokine cxcl10 enhances ability cd8+ t cells control pathogen toxoplasma gondii brains chronically infected mice chemokine boosts t-cell function two different ways: maintains effector t-cell population brain speeds average migration speed without changing nature walk statistics notably statistics brownian; rather cd8+ t-cell motility brain well described generalized levy walk according model unexpected feature enables t cells find rare targets order magnitude efficiency brownian random walkers thus cd8+ t-cell behaviour similar levy strategies reported organisms ranging mussels marine predators monkeys4- cxcl10 aids t cells shortening average time taken find rare targets
