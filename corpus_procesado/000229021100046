enhancement cellular memory reducing stochastic transitions
induction cell differentiation distinct cell phenotypes encoded complex genetic networks- networks can prevent reversion established phenotypes even presence significant fluctuations explore key parameters determine stability cellular memory using yeast galactose-signalling network model system network contains multiple nested feedback loops two positive feedback loops loop mediated cytoplasmic signal transducer gal3p able generate two stable expression states persistent memory previous galactose consumption states parallel loop mediated galactose transporter gal2p increases expression difference two states negative feedback inhibitor gal80p reduces strength core positive feedback despite constitutive increase gal80p concentration tunes system destabilized memory persistent memory model reveals fluctuations trapped efficiently higher gal80p concentrations indeed rate single cells randomly switch back forth expression states reduced observations provide quantitative understanding stability reversibility cellular differentiation states
