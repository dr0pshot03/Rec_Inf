thiamine derivatives bind messenger rnas directly regulate bacterial gene expression 
although proteins fulfil requirements biology structural functional components enzymes receptors rna can also serve capacities example rna sufficient structural plasticity form ribozyme12 receptor34 elements exhibit considerable enzymatic power binding specificity moreover activities can combined create allosteric ribozymes56 modulated effector molecules also proposed7- certain messenger rnas might use allosteric mechanisms mediate regulatory responses depending specific metabolites report mrnas encoding enzymes involved thiamine vitamin b- biosynthesis escherichia coli can bind thiamine pyrophosphate derivative without need protein cofactors mrna-effector complex adopts distinct structure sequesters ribosome-binding site leads reduction gene expression metabolite-sensing regulatory system provides example riboswitch whose evolutionary origin might pre-date emergence proteins
