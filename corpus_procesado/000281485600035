signaling kinase ampk activates stress-promoted transcription via histone h2b phosphorylation
mammalian adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase ampk serine-threonine kinase protein complex central regulator cellular energy homeostasis however mechanisms ampk mediates cellular responses metabolic stress remain unclear found ampk activates transcription direct association chromatin phosphorylation histone h2b serine ampk recruitment h2b ser phosphorylation colocalized within genes activated ampk-dependent pathways promoters transcribed regions ectopic expression h2b ser substituted alanine reduced transcription rna polymerase ii association ampk-dependent genes lowered cell survival response stress results place ampk-dependent h2b ser phosphorylation direct transcriptional chromatin regulatory pathway leading cellular adaptation stress
