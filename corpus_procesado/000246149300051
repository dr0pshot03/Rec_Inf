positive feedback mechanism governs polarity motion motile cilia 
ciliated epithelia produce fluid flow many organ systems ranging respiratory tract clears mucus1 ventricles brain transports cerebrospinal fluid2 human diseases disable ciliary flow primary ciliary dyskinesia can compromise organ function ability resist pathogens resulting recurring respiratory infections otitis hydrocephaly infertility3 create ciliary flow cilia within cell need polarized coordinately along planar axis epithelium polarity established ciliated epithelia known analyse developmental mechanisms polarize cilia using ciliated cells developing xenopus larval skin model system4 show cilia acquire polarity sequence events beginning polar bias set tissue patterning followed refinement phase results indicate refinement fluid flow necessary sufficient determining cilia polarity findings reveal novel mechanism tissue patterning coupled fluid flow act positive feedback loop direct planar polarity cilia
