quadrupole transitions revealed borrmann spectroscopy
borrmann effect dramatic increase transparency x ray beams observed x rays satisfying braggs law diffract perfect crystal minimization absorption seen borrmann effect explained noting electric field x ray beam approaches zero amplitude crystal planes thus avoiding atoms show experimentally conditions absorption suppression weaker electric quadrupole absorption transitions effectively enhanced degree can dominate absorption spectrum effect can exploited atomic spectroscopy technique show quadrupole transitions give rise additional structure l l l absorption edges gadolinium gadolinium gallium garnet mark onset excitations 2s 2p/ 2p/ atomic core levels respectively although borrmann effect served underpin development theory x ray diffraction- potentially important experimental application phenomenon since first observation seven decades ago identifying quadrupole features x ray absorption spectroscopy central interpretation pre edge spectra often taken indicators local symmetry valence atomic environment quadrupolar absorption isolates states different symmetries dominant dipole spectrum typically reveals orbitals dominate electronic ground state properties lanthanides 3d transition metals including magnetism results borrmann spectroscopy technique feed contemporary discussions regarding resonant x ray diffraction nature pre-edge lines identified inelastic x ray scattering furthermore borrmann effect observed photonic materials seems likely quadrupole enhancement reported will play important role modern optics
