activation integrin alpha iib beta modulation transmembrane helix associations
transmembrane helices integrin alpha beta subunits implicated regulation integrin activity two mutations glycine asparagine g708n methionine asparagine- transmembrane helix beta3 subunit enabled integrin alphaiibbeta3 constitutively bind soluble fibrinogen characterization g708n mutant revealed induced alphaiibbeta3 clustering constitutive phosphorylation focal adhesion kinase mutation also enhanced tendency transmembrane helix form homotrimers results suggest homomeric associations involving transmembrane domains provide driving force integrin activation also suggest structural basis coincidence integrin activation clustering
