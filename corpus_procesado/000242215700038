global variation copy number human genome 
copy number variation cnv dna sequences functionally significant yet fully ascertained constructed first-generation cnv map human genome study individuals four populations ancestry europe africa asia hapmap collection dna individuals screened cnv using two complementary technologies: single-nucleotide polymorphism snp genotyping arrays clone-based comparative genomic hybridization total copy number variable regions cnvrs can encompass overlapping adjacent gains losses covering megabases % genome identified populations cnvrs contained hundreds genes disease loci functional elements segmental duplications notably cnvrs encompassed nucleotide content per genome snps underscoring importance cnv genetic diversity evolution data obtained delineate linkage disequilibrium patterns many cnvs reveal marked variation copy number among populations also demonstrate utility resource genetic disease studies
