vortices superfluidity strongly interacting fermi gas 
quantum degenerate fermi gases provide remarkable opportunity study strongly interacting fermions contrast fermi systems superconductors neutron stars quark-gluon plasma early universe gases low densities interactions can precisely controlled enormous range previous experiments fermi gases revealed condensation fermion pairs although studies consistent predictions assuming superfluidity proof superfluid behaviour elusive report observations vortex lattices strongly interacting rotating fermi gas provide definitive evidence superfluidity interaction therefore pairing strength two li- fermions near feshbach resonance can controlled external magnetic field allows us explore crossover bose-einstein condensate molecules bardeen-cooper-schrieffer superfluid loosely bound pairs crossover associated new form superfluidity may provide insights high-transition-temperature superconductors
