pax3 functions nodal point melanocyte stem cell differentiation
stem cells totipotent instead partially committed remain undifferentiated upon appropriate stimulation capable regenerating mature cell types little known genetic programmes maintain undifferentiated phenotype lineage-restricted stem cells describe molecular details nodal point adult melanocyte stem cell differentiation pax3 simultaneously functions initiate melanogenic cascade acting downstream prevent terminal differentiation pax3 activates expression mitf transcription factor critical melanogenesis time competes mitf occupancy enhancer required expression dopachrome tautomerase enzyme functions melanin synthesis pax3-expressing melanoblasts thus committed undifferentiated pax3-mediated repression relieved activated beta-catenin thus stem cell transcription factor can determine cell fate simultaneously maintain undifferentiated state leaving cell poised differentiate response external stimuli
