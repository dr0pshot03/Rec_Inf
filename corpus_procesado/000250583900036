nanoscale friction varied isotopic shifting surface vibrational frequencies 
friction converts kinetic energy sliding interfaces lattice vibrations detailed mechanisms process remain unresolved atomic force microscopy measurements reveal changing mass terminating atoms surface thus vibrational frequencies affects nanoscale friction substantially compared hydrogen deuterium-terminated single-crystal diamond silicon surfaces cases hydrogenated surface exhibited higher friction result implies lower natural frequency chemisorbed deuterium reduces rate tips kinetic energy dissipated discovery consistent model describing energy transfer adsorbates moving surface
