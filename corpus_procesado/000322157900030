heavy solitons fermionic superfluid
solitons-solitary waves maintain shape propagate-occur water waves narrow canals light pulses optical fibres quantum mechanical matter waves superfluids superconductors highly nonlinear localized nature makes sensitive probes medium propagate create long-lived solitons strongly interacting superfluid fermionic atoms directly observe motion interactions tuned regime bose-einstein condensation tightly bound molecules towards bardeen-cooper-schrieffer limit long-range cooper pairs solitons effective mass increases markedly times bare mass signalling strong quantum fluctuations mass enhancement times larger theoretically predicted value work provides benchmark theories non-equilibrium dynamics strongly interacting fermions
