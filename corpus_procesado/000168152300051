neuronal repellent slit inhibits leukocyte chemotaxis induced chemotactic factors
migration basic feature many cell types wide range species since 1800s cell migration proposed occur nervous immune systems distinct molecular cues mammalian neurons leukocytes identified report slit secreted protein previously known role repulsion axon guidance neuronal migration can also inhibit leukocyte chemotaxis induced chemotactic factors slit inhibition chemokine-induced chemotaxis can reconstituted co-expression chemokine receptor containing seven transmembrane domains roundabout robo slit receptor containing single transmembrane domain thus functional interaction single seven transmembrane receptors results reveal activity neuronal guidance cue regulating leukocyte migration indicate may general conservation guidance mechanisms underlying metazoan cell migration addition uncovered inhibitor leukocyte chemotaxis propose new therapeutic approach treat diseases involving leukocyte migration chemotactic factors
