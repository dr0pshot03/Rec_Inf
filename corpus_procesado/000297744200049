frictional ageing interfacial bonding origins rate state friction 
earthquakes long recognized result stick-slip frictional instabilities past decades laboratory studies rock friction elucidated many aspects tectonic fault zone processes earthquake phenomena- typically static friction rocks grows logarithmically time held stationary contact mechanism responsible strengthening understood time-dependent increase frictional strength frictional ageing one manifestation evolution effect rate state friction theory prevailing view time dependence rock friction results increases contact area caused creep contacting asperities present results atomic force microscopy experiments instead show frictional ageing arises formation interfacial chemical bonds large magnitude ageing nanometre scale quantitatively consistent required explain observations macroscopic rock friction experiments relative magnitude evolution effect compared direct effect-the dependence friction instantaneous changes slip velocity-determine whether unstable slip leading earthquakes possible understanding mechanism underlying evolution effect enable us formulate physically based frictional constitutive laws rather current empirically based laws allowing confident extrapolation natural faults
