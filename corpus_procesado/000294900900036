unclicking click: mechanically facilitated -dipolar cycloreversions
specific targeting covalent bonds local anisotropic fashion using mechanical methods offers useful opportunities direct chemical reactivity otherwise prohibitive pathways report embedding highly inert -triazole moiety often prepared using canonical click coupling azides alkynes within polymethyl acrylate chain renders susceptible ultrasound-induced cycloreversion confirmed comprehensive spectroscopic chemical analyses reactivity offers opportunity develop triazoles mechanically labile protecting groups use readily accessible materials respond mechanical force
