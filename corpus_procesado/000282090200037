ptychographic x-ray computed tomography nanoscale 
x-ray tomography invaluable tool biomedical imaging can deliver three-dimensional internal structure entire organisms well single cells even gives access quantitative information crucially important medical applications basic research- frequently information based x-ray attenuation phase contrast sometimes used improved visibility remains significantly harder quantify describe x-ray computed tomography technique generates quantitative high-contrast three-dimensional electron density maps phase contrast information without reverting assumptions weak phase object negligible absorption method uses ptychographic coherent imaging approach record tomographic data sets exploiting high penetration power hard x-rays high sensitivity lensless imaging- example present images bone sample structures nm length scale osteocyte lacunae interconnective canalicular network clearly resolved recovered electron density map provides contrast high enough estimate nanoscale bone density variations less one per cent expect high-resolution tomography technique provide invaluable information life materials sciences
