long-lived lunar dynamo driven continuous mechanical stirring
lunar rocks contain record ancient magnetic field seems persisted million years attributed lunar dynamo models conventional dynamos driven thermal compositional convection difficulty reproducing existence apparently long duration lunar dynamo- investigate alternative mechanism dynamo generation: continuous mechanical stirring arising differential motion due earth-driven precession lunar spin axis solid silicate mantle liquid core beneath show fluid motions power required drive dynamo operating continuously one billion years generating magnetic field intensity one microtesla billion years ago readily obtained mechanical stirring magnetic field predicted decrease time shut naturally moon recedes far enough earth dissipated power insufficient drive dynamo nominal model occurred earth radii billion years ago thus lunar palaeomagnetic measurements may able constrain poorly known early orbital evolution moon mechanism may also applicable dynamos bodies large asteroids
