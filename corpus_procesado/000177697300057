hierarchical organization modularity metabolic networks
spatially chemically isolated functional modules composed several cellular components carrying discrete functions considered fundamental building blocks cellular organization presence highly integrated biochemical networks lacks quantitative support show metabolic networks distinct organisms organized many small highly connected topologic modules combine hierarchical manner larger less cohesive units number degree clustering following power law within escherichia coli uncovered hierarchical modularity closely overlaps known metabolic functions identified network architecture may generic system-level cellular organization
