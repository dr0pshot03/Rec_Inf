translocation step size mechanism therecbc dna helicase
dna helicases ubiquitous enzymes unwind double-stranded dna- diverse group proteins move linear fashion along one-dimensional polymer lattice-dna-by using mechanism couples nucleoside triphosphate hydrolysis translocation double-stranded dna unwinding produce separate strands dna recbc enzyme processive dna helicase functions homologous recombination escherichia coli unwinds base pairs per binding event hydrolyses slightly one atp molecule per base pair unwound show using series gapped oligonucleotide substrates enzyme translocates along one strand duplex dna -> direction translocating enzyme will traverse step across single-stranded dna gaps defined steps +/- nucleotides length step much larger amount double-stranded dna can unwound using free energy derived hydrolysis one molecule atp implying translocation dna unwinding separate events propose recbc enzyme translocates unwinds quantized two-step inchworm-like mechanism may parallels translocation linear motor proteins
