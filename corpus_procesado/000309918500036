aged niche disrupts muscle stem cell quiescence
niche conserved regulator stem cell quiescence function ageing stem cell function declines extent means age-related changes within niche contribute phenomenon unknown demonstrate aged muscle stem cell niche muscle fibre expresses fgf2 homeostatic conditions driving subset satellite cells break quiescence lose self-renewing capacity show mice relatively dormant aged satellite cells robustly express sprouty spry1 inhibitor fibroblast growth factor fgf signalling increasing fgf signalling aged satellite cells homeostatic conditions removing spry1 results loss quiescence satellite cell depletion diminished regenerative capacity conversely reducing niche-derived fgf activity inhibition fgfr1 signalling overexpression spry1 satellite cells prevents depletion experiments identify age-dependent change stem cell niche directly influences stem cell quiescence function
