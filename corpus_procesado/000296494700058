rnap ii ctd phosphorylated threonine required histone mrna end processing 
rna polymerase ii rnap ii largest subunit contains c-terminal domain ctd tyr-ser-pro-thr-ser-pro-ser consensus repeats serines known phosphorylated modifications help orchestrate interplay transcription processing messenger rna mrna precursors provide evidence phosphorylation ctd thr residues required specifically histone mrna end processing functioning facilitate recruitment processing factors histone genes like ser thr phosphorylation requires ctd kinase cdk9 evolutionarily conserved yeast human data thus illustrate ctd modification can play highly specific role facilitating efficient gene expression
