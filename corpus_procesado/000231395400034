convergence synthetic organic polymer chemistries
several recent conceptual advances take advantage design criteria practical techniques molecular-level control organic chemistry allow preparation well-defined polymers nanostructured materials two trends clear: realization synthesis complex macromolecules poses major challenges opportunities expectation materials will exhibit distinctive properties functions polymer synthesis methods now developed will yield well-defined synthetic macromolecules capable mimicking many features proteins example three-dimensional folded structure natural materials macromolecules far-reaching potential study molecular-level behavior interfaces thin films solution also enabling development encapsulation drug-delivery nanoscale-patterning technologies
