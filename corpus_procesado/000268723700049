generalized models reveal stabilizing factors food webs 
insights stabilizes natural food webs always limited fundamental dilemma: studies either need make unwarranted simplifying assumptions undermines relevance examine replicates small food webs hampers robustness findings used generalized modeling study several billion replicates food webs nonlinear interactions species way first show higher variability link strengths stabilizes food webs webs relatively small whereas larger webs instead destabilized second reveal new power law describing food-web stability scales number species connectance third report two universal rules: food-web stability enhanced species high trophic level feed multiple prey species ii species intermediate trophic level fed upon multiple predator species
