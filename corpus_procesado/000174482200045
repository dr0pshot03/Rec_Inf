inhibition climbing fibres signal extinction conditioned eyelid responses
fundamental tenet cerebellar learning theories asserts climbing fibre afferents inferior olive provide teaching signal promotes gradual adaptation movements- data several forms motor learning provide support tenet- pavlovian eyelid conditioning example tone repeatedly paired reinforcing unconditioned stimulus like periorbital stimulation unconditioned stimulus promotes acquisition conditioned eyelid responses activating climbing fibres- climbing fibre activity elicited unconditioned stimulus inhibited expression conditioned responses--consistent inhibitory projection cerebellum inferior olive show inhibition climbing fibres serves teaching signal extinction learning respond signalled presenting tone without unconditioned stimulus used reversible infusion synaptic receptor antagonists show blocking inhibitory input climbing fibres prevents extinction conditioned response whereas blocking excitatory input induces extinction results combined analysis climbing fibre activity computer simulation cerebellar-olivary system- suggest transient inhibition climbing fibres background level signal drives extinction
