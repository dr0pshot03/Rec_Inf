observation squeezed light one atom excited two photons
single quantum emitters atoms well known non-classical light sources reduced noise intensity capable producing photons one one given times however light field emitted single atom can exhibit much richer dynamics prominent example predicted ability single atom produce quadrature-squeezed light fluctuations amplitude phase shot-noise level however squeezing much difficult observe emission single photons squeezed beams generated using macroscopic mesoscopic media tens atoms despite experimental efforts- single-atom squeezing far escaped observation generate squeezed light single atom high-finesse optical resonator strong coupling atom cavity field induces genuine quantum mechanical nonlinearity several orders magnitude larger typical macroscopic media- produces observable quadrature squeezing- excitation beam containing average two photons per system lifetime sharp contrast emission single photons squeezed light stems quantum coherence photon pairs emitted system ability single atom induce strong coherent interactions propagating photons opens new perspectives photonic quantum logic single emitters-
