drag reduction self-similar bending flexible body 
classical theory high-speed flow1 predicts moving rigid object experiences drag proportional square speed however reasoning apply object flow flexible shape becomes function speed-for example rolling broad tree leaves stiff wind2 reconfiguration bodies fluid forces common nature can result substantial drag reduction beneficial many organisms34 experimental studies flow-structure interactions5 generally lack theoretical interpretation unifies body flow mechanics use flexible fibre immersed flowing soap film measure drag reduction arises bending fibre flow using model couples hydrodynamics bending predict reduced drag growth compared classical theory fibre undergoes bending transition producing shapes self-similar; configurations drag scales length self-similarity rather fibre profile width predictions supported experimental data
