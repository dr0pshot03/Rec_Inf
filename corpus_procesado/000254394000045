determining transition-state geometries liquids using 2d-ir 
many properties chemical reactions determined transition state connecting reactant product yet difficult directly obtain information short lived structures liquids show two dimensional infrared 2d ir spectroscopy can provide direct information transition states tracking transformation vibrational modes molecule crossed transition state successfully monitored simple chemical reaction fluxional rearrangement feco exchange axial equatorial co ligands causes exchange vibrational energy normal modes molecule energy transfer provides direct evidence regarding time scale transition state mechanism reaction
