microbial ecology ocean biogeochemistry: community perspective 
oceans harbor tremendous diversity marine microbes different functional groups bacteria archaea protists arise diversity dominate various habitats drive globally important biogeochemical cycles explanations distribution microbial taxa associated activity often focus resource availability abiotic conditions however continual reshaping communities mortality allelopathy symbiosis processes shows community interactions exert strong selective pressure marine microbes deeper exploration microbial interactions now possible via molecular prospecting taxon specific experimental approaches holistic outlook encompasses full array selective pressures individuals will help elucidate maintenance microbial diversity regulation biogeochemical reactions planktonic communities
