ikb kinase-alpha acts epidermis control skeletal craniofacial morphogenesis 
ikappab kinase-alpha ikk-alpha1 exhibits protein-kinase-dependent independent functions kinase activity required lymphoid organogenesis2 mammary gland development3 whereas kinase-independent activity required epidermal keratinocyte differentiation4 addition failed epidermal differentiation ikk-alpha-deficient mice exhibit abnormal skeletal craniofacial morphogenesis4- similar defects exhibited mice experience systemic inhibition nf-kappab7 postulated morphogenetic defects ikk-alpha-deficient mice caused reduced nf-kappab activity instead due failed epidermal differentiation disrupts proper epidermal-mesodermal interactions tested hypothesis introducing epidermal-specific ikka also known chuk transgene ikk-alpha-deficient mice mice lacking ikk-alpha cell types including bone cartilage basal epidermal keratinocytes exhibit normal epidermal differentiation skeletal morphology thus epidermal differentiation required proper morphogenesis mesodermally derived skeletal elements one way ikk-alpha controls skeletal craniofacial morphogenesis repressing expression fibroblast growth factor fgf family members fgf8 whose expression specifically elevated limb bud ectoderm ikk-alpha-deficient mice
