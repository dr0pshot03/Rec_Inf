estimation fault strength: reconstruction stress kobe earthquake 
estimated stress field kobe japan earthquake moment magnitude using situ post-shock stress measurements obtained hydraulic fracturing experiments near fault reconstructed pre-shock stress field using kinematic source model inverted seismic waveforms geodetic deformations found center fault two sides fault surface coupled completely earthquake coefficient friction equivalent strong crust edge fault possible aseismic slip expected occur pre-shock stress orientation
