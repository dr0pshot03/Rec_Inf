regolith migration sorting asteroid itokawa 
high-resolution images surface asteroid itokawa hayabusa mission reveal covered unconsolidated millimeter-sized larger gravels locations morphologic characteristics gravel indicate itokawa experienced considerable vibrations triggered global-scale granular processes dry vacuum microgravity environment processes likely include granular convection landslide-like granular migrations particle sorting resulting segregation fine gravels areas potential lows granular processes become major resurfacing processes itokawas small size implying can occur small asteroids regolith
