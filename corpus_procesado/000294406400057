tet proteins can convert methylcytosine formylcytosine carboxylcytosine 
-methylcytosine 5mc dna plays important role gene expression genomic imprinting suppression transposable elements 5mc can converted hydroxymethylcytosine 5hmc tet ten eleven translocation proteins show addition 5hmc tet proteins can generate formylcytosine 5fc carboxylcytosine 5cac 5mc enzymatic activity-dependent manner furthermore reveal presence 5fc 5cac genomic dna mouse embryonic stem cells mouse organs genomic content 5hmc 5fc 5cac can increased reduced overexpression depletion tet proteins thus identify two previously unknown cytosine derivatives genomic dna products tet proteins study raises possibility dna demethylation may occur tet-catalyzed oxidation followed decarboxylation
