habenular alpha nicotinic receptor subunit signalling controls nicotine intake
genetic variation chrn alpha gene encoding alpha nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunit increases vulnerability tobacco addiction lung cancer underlying mechanisms unknown report markedly increased nicotine intake mice null mutation chrn alpha effect rescued knockout mice re-expressing alpha subunits medial habenula mhb recapitulated rats alpha subunit knockdown mhb remarkably alpha subunit knockdown mhb alter rewarding effects nicotine abolished inhibitory effects higher nicotine doses brain reward systems mhb extends projections almost exclusively interpeduncular nucleus ipn found diminished ipn activation response nicotine alpha knockout mice disruption ipn signalling increased nicotine intake rats findings indicate nicotine activates habenulo-interpeduncular pathway alpha containing nachrs triggering inhibitory motivational signal acts limit nicotine intake
