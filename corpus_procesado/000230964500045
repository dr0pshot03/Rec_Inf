centrosome localization determines neuronal polarity 
neuronal polarization occurs shortly mitosis neurons differentiating vitro axon formation follows segregation growth-promoting activities one multiple neurites form mitosis12 unresolved whether spatial restriction makes use intrinsic program like c elegans embryo polarization3 extrinsic cue-mediated migratory cells4 show hippocampal neurons vitro axon consistently arises neurite develops first mitosis centrosomes golgi apparatus endosomes cluster together close area first neurite will form turn opposite plane last mitotic division show polarized activities organelles necessary sufficient neuronal polarization: polarized microtubule polymerization membrane transport precedes first neurite formation neurons one centrosome sprout one axon suppression centrosome-mediated functions precludes polarization conclude asymmetric centrosome-mediated dynamics early post-mitotic stage instruct neuronal polarity implying pre-mitotic mechanisms role division orientation may turn participate event
