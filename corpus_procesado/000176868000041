genetic diversity chloroquine selective sweeps plasmodium falciparum 
widespread use antimalarial agents can profoundly influence evolution human malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum recent selective sweeps drug-resistant genotypes may restricted genetic diversity parasite resembling effects attributed current debates- historic population bottleneck chloroquine-resistant cqr parasites initially reported years ago two foci southeast asia south america number cqr founder mutations impact chlorquine parasite genomes worldwide difficult evaluate using highly polymorphic microsatellite markers genetic map show level genetic diversity varies substantially among different regions parasite genome revealing extensive linkage disequilibrium surrounding key cqr gene pfcrt least four cqr founder events disequilibrium decay rate pfcrt-flanking region consistent strong directional selective sweeps occurring similar to20 sexual generations especially single resistant pfcrt haplotype spreading high frequencies throughout asia africa presence linkage disequilibrium provides basis mapping genes drug selection p falciparum
