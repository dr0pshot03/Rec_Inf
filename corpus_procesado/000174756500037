bunching fractionally charged quasiparticles tunnelling high-potential barriers 
shot noise measurements used measure charge quasiparticles fractional quantum hall fqh regime- induce shot noise otherwise noiseless current quasiparticles barrier placed path cause weak backscattering measured shot noise proportional charge quasiparticles example filling factor v / noise corresponding q e/ appears increasingly opaque barriers measured charge increases monotonically approaching q e asymptotically therefore believed electrons alternatively three bunched quasiparticles can tunnel high-potential barriers encountered noiseless current quasiparticles investigate interaction e/ quasiparticles strong barrier fqh samples find bunching quasiparticles strong backscattering limit depends average dilution quasiparticle current dilute current bunching ceases altogether transferred charge approaches q e/ surprising result demonstrates quasiparticles can tunnel individually high-potential barriers originally thought opaque
