detection large-scale structure intracluster globular clusters virgo cluster
globular clusters usually found galaxies excellent tracers dark matter long ago suggested intracluster globular clusters igcs may exist bound galaxy cluster rather single galaxy present map showing large-scale distribution globular clusters entire virgo cluster shows igcs found million light years virgo center concentrated several substructures much larger galaxies objects might mostly stripped low-mass dwarf galaxies
