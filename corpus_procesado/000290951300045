neural crest regulates myogenesis transient activation notch 
dynamic signalling extensive tissue rearrangements interact generate complex patterns shapes embryogenesis poorly understood- characterize signalling events taking place early morphogenesis chick skeletal muscles show muscle progenitors present somites require transient activation notch signalling undergo terminal differentiation notch ligand delta1 expressed mosaic pattern neural crest cells migrate past somites gain loss delta1 function neural crest modifies notch signalling somites results delayed premature myogenesis results indicate neural crest regulates early muscle formation unique mechanism relies migration delta1-expressing neural crest cells trigger transient activation notch signalling selected muscle progenitors dynamic signalling guarantees balanced progressive differentiation muscle progenitor pool
