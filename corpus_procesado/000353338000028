old supernova dust factory revealed galactic center
dust formation supernova ejecta currently leading candidate explain large quantities dust observed distant early universe however unclear whether ejecta-formed dust can survive hot interior supernova remnant snr present infrared observations similar solar masses warm similar kelvin dust seen near center similar -year-old sagittarius east snr galactic center findings indicate detection dust within older snr expanding relatively dense surrounding medium electron density similar centimeters- survived passage reverse shock results suggest supernovae may dominant dust-production mechanism dense environment galaxies early universe
