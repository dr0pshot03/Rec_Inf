first cleavage mouse zygote predicts blastocyst axis
one unanswered questions mammalian development embryonic abembryonic axis blastocyst first established possible first cleavage division contributes process mouse embryos progeny one two-cell blastomere primarily populate embryonic part blastocyst progeny sister populate abembryonic part- however known whether embryonic abembryonic axis set first cleavage polarity oocyte sets first cleavage plane respect animal pole indeed whether can divorced entirely first cleavage established relation animal pole test importance orientation first cleavage imposing elongated shape zygote division longer passes close animal pole marked second polar body non-invasive lineage tracing shows even first cleavage occurs along short axis imposed experimental treatment progeny resulting two-cell blastomeres tend populate respective embryonic abembryonic parts blastocyst thus first cleavage contributes breaking symmetry embryo generating blastomeres different developmental characteristics
