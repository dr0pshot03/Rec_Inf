role rapid dendritic protein synthesis hippocampal mglur-dependent long-term depression 
hippocampal pyramidal neuron receives excitatory glutamatergic synapses many synapses contain molecular machinery messenger rna translation suggesting protein complement thus function synapse can regulated basis activity local postsynaptic protein synthesis triggered synaptic activation metabotropic glutamate receptors found modify synaptic transmission within minutes
