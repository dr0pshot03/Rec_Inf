dysrhythmia suprachiasmatic nucleus inhibits memory processing 
chronic circadian dysfunction impairs declarative memory humans little effect common rodent models arrhythmia caused clock gene knockouts surgical ablation suprachiasmatic nucleus scn important problem overlooked translational models human dysrhythmia occurs scn circuitry genetically neurologically intact siberian hamsters phodopus sungorus particularly well suited translational studies can made arrhythmic one-time photic treatment severely impairs spatial recognition memory found animals made arrhythmic subsequent scn ablation completely rescues memory processing data suggest inhibitory effects malfunctioning scn cognition require preservation circuitry scn downstream targets lost connections severed
