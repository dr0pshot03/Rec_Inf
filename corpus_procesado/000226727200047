insects breathe discontinuously avoid oxygen toxicity 
respiratory organs terrestrial insects consist tracheal tubes external spiracular valves control gas exchange despite relatively high metabolic rate many insects highly discontinuous patterns gas exchange including long periods spiracles fully closed two explanations previously put forward explain behaviour: first pattern serves reduce respiratory water loss second pattern may initially evolved underground insects way dealing hypoxic hypercapnic conditions propose third possible explanation based idea oxygen necessary oxidative metabolism also acts toxic chemical can cause oxidative damage tissues even relatively low concentrations physiologically normal partial pressures co2 rate co2 diffusion insect respiratory system slower rate o entry leads build-up intratracheal co2 spiracles must therefore opened intervals rid insect accumulated co2 process exposes tissues dangerously high levels o- suggest cyclical pattern open closed spiracles observed resting insects necessary consequence need rid respiratory system accumulated co2 followed need reduce oxygen toxicity
