complexity strongly correlated electronic systems 
wide variety experimental results theoretical investigations recent years convincingly demonstrated several transition metal oxides materials dominant states spatially homogeneous occurs cases several physical interactions-spin charge lattice and/or orbital-are simultaneously active phenomenon causes interesting effects colossal magnetoresistance also appears crucial understand high-temperature superconductors spontaneous emergence electronic nanometer-scale structures transition metal oxides existence many competing states properties often associated complex matter nonlinearities dominate soft materials biological systems electronic complexity potential consequences applications correlated electronic materials charge semiconducting electronic charge spin spintronics relevance addition lattice orbital degrees freedom active leading giant responses small perturbations moreover several metallic insulating phases compete increasing potential novel behavior
