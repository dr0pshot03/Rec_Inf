auroral flare jupiter
jupiters aurora powerful solar system powered largely energy extracted planetary rotation although seems also contribution solar wind contrasts earths aurora generated interaction solar wind magnetosphere major features jupiters aurora based far-ultraviolet- near-infrared visible-wavelength observations include main oval generally corotates planet region patchy diffuse emission inside oval jupiters dusk side report discovery rapidly evolving bright localized emission poleward northern main oval region connected magnetically jupiters outer magnetosphere intensity emission increased factor within 70s decreased similar timescale captured single four-minute exposure type flaring emission previously reported jupiter similar smaller transient events observed earth may related directly changes solar wind
