long-term dendritic spine stability adult cortex
structural dynamics synapses probably crucial role development plasticity nervous system mammalian brain vast majority excitatory axo-dendritic synapses occur dendritic specializations called spines however little known long-term changes intact developing adult animal address question developed transcranial two-photon imaging technique follow identified spines layer pyramidal neurons primary visual cortex living transgenic mice expressing yellow fluorescent protein show filopodia-like dendritic protrusions extending retracting hours abundant young animals virtually absent adult young mice within critical period visual cortex development similar to73% spines remain stable one-month interval changes associated spine elimination contrast adult mice overwhelming majority spines similar to96% remain stable interval half-life greater months results indicate spines initially plastic development become remarkably stable adult providing potential structural basis long-term information storage
