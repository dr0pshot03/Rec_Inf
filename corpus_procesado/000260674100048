induced pluripotent stem cells generated without viral integration
pluripotent stem cells generated mouse human somatic cells viral expression transcription factors oct4 sox2 klf4 c-myc major limitation technology use potentially harmful genome integrating viruses generated mouse induced pluripotent stem ips cells fibroblasts liver cells using nonintegrating adenoviruses transiently expressing oct4 sox2 klf4 c myc adenoviral ips adeno ips cells show dna demethylation characteristic reprogrammed cells express endogenous pluripotency genes form teratomas contribute multiple tissues including germ line chimeric mice results provide strong evidence insertional mutagenesis required vitro reprogramming adenoviral reprogramming may provide improved method generating studying patient specific stem cells comparing embryonic stem cells ips cells
