variations dna elucidate molecular networks cause disease
identifying variations dna increase susceptibility disease one primary aims genetic studies using forward genetics approach however identification disease susceptibility genes means studies provides limited functional information genes lead disease fact cases absence functional information altogether preventing definitive identification susceptibility gene genes develop alternative classic forward genetics approach dissecting complex disease traits instead identifying susceptibility genes directly affected variations dna identify gene networks perturbed susceptibility loci turn lead disease application method liver adipose gene expression data generated segregating mouse population results identification macrophage enriched network supported causal relationship disease traits associated metabolic syndrome three genes network lipoprotein lipase lpl lactamase beta lactb protein phosphatase like ppm1l validated previously unknown obesity genes strengthening association network metabolic disease traits analysis provides direct experimental support complex traits obesity emergent properties molecular networks modulated complex genetic loci environmental factors
