reconstructing microbial diversity function pre-agricultural tallgrass prairie soils united states 
native tallgrass prairie dominated much midwestern united states biome soil microbial diversity sustained highly productive system almost completely eradicated decades agricultural practices reconstructed soil microbial diversity existed biome analyzing relict prairie soils found biogeographical patterns largely driven changes relative abundance verrucomicrobia poorly studied bacterial phylum appears dominate many prairie soils shotgun metagenomic data suggested spatial patterns associated strong shifts carbon dynamics show metagenomic approaches can used reconstruct below-ground biogeochemical diversity gradients endangered ecosystems information used improve restoration efforts given even small changes below-ground microbial diversity can important impacts ecosystem processes
