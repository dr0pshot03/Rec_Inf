neural mechanisms visual attention: top-down feedback highlights relevant locations 
attention helps us process potentially important objects selectively increasing activity sensory neurons represent relevant locations features environment selection process requires top-down feedback important environment investigated parietal cortical output influences neural activity early sensory areas neural recordings made simultaneously posterior parietal cortex earlier area visual pathway medial temporal area macaques performing visual matching task monkey selectively attended location timing activities two regions became synchronized parietal cortex leading medial temporal area parietal neurons may thus selectively increase activity earlier sensory areas enable focused spatial attention
