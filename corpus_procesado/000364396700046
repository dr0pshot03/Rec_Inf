oxygen regulation breathing olfactory receptor activated lactate 
animals evolved homeostatic responses changes oxygen availability act different timescales although hypoxia-inducible factor hif transcriptional pathway controls long-term responses low oxygen hypoxia established pathway mediates acute responses hypoxia mammals well understood show olfactory receptor gene olfr78 highly selectively expressed oxygen-sensitive glomus cells carotid body chemosensory organ carotid artery bifurcation monitors blood oxygen stimulates breathing within seconds oxygen declines olfr78 mutants fail increase ventilation hypoxia respond normally hypercapnia glomus cells present normal numbers appear structurally intact hypoxia-induced carotid body activity diminished lactate metabolite rapidly accumulates hypoxia induces hyperventilation- activates olfr78 heterologous expression experiments induces calcium transients glomus cells stimulates carotid sinus nerve activity olfr78 propose addition role olfaction olfr78 acts hypoxia sensor breathing circuit sensing lactate produced oxygen levels decline
