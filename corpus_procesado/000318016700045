population growth wild bird buffered phenological mismatch
broad-scale environmental changes altering patterns natural selection wild empirical studies quantified demographic cost sustained directional selection response changes tested whether population growth wild bird negatively affected climate change-induced phenological mismatch using almost four decades individual-level life-history data great tit population population warmer springs generated mismatch annual breeding time seasonal food peak intensifying directional selection earlier laying dates interannual variation population mismatch however affected population growth demonstrated mechanism contributing uncoupling whereby fitness losses associated mismatch counteracted fitness gains due relaxed competition findings imply natural populations may able tolerate considerable maladaptation driven shifting climatic conditions without undergoing immediate declines
