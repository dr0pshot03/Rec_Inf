nucleosynthetic signatures first stars 
chemically primitive stars provide constraints nature first stellar objects formed universe elements hydrogen helium traces lithium present within objects generated nucleosynthesis first stars relative abundances elements surviving primitive stars reflect masses first stars pathways nucleosynthesis quite sensitive stellar masses several models- suggested explain origin abundance pattern giant star he0107 hitherto exhibited highest deficiency heavy elements known report discovery he1327 subgiant main-sequence star iron abundance factor two lower he0107 stars show extreme overabundances carbon nitrogen respect iron suggesting similar origin abundance patterns unexpectedly low li high sr abundances he1327 however challenge existing theoretical understanding: model predicts high sr abundance provides li depletion mechanism consistent data available metal-poor stars
