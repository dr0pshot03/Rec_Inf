evasion intracellular host defence hepatitis c virus 
viral infection mammalian cells rapidly triggers intracellular signalling events leading interferon alpha/beta production cellular antiviral state host response first line immune defence infection imposes several barriers viral replication spread hepatitis c virus hcv evades host response complex combination processes include signalling interference effector modulation continual viral genetic variation evasion strategies support persistent infection spread hcv defining molecular mechanisms hcv regulates host response crucial importance may reveal targets novel therapeutic strategies
