cancer genome landscapes 
past decade comprehensive sequencing efforts revealed genomic landscapes common forms human cancer cancer types landscape consists small number "mountains" genes altered high percentage tumors much larger number "hills" genes altered infrequently date studies revealed similar genes altered intragenic mutations can promote "drive" tumorigenesis typical tumor contains two eight "driver gene" mutations; remaining mutations passengers confer selective growth advantage driver genes can classified signaling pathways regulate three core cellular processes: cell fate cell survival genome maintenance better understanding pathways one pressing needs basic cancer research even now however knowledge cancer genomes sufficient guide development effective approaches reducing cancer morbidity mortality
