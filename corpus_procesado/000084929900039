neutral single-component nickel ii polyolefin catalysts tolerate heteroatoms 
half million metric tons polymers produced year polyolefins current technology uses highly active cationic catalysts suffer inability tolerate heteroatoms oxygen nitrogen sulfur systems require scrupulously clean starting materials activating cocatalysts family catalysts developed whose members tolerant heteroatoms less pure starting materials heteroatom-tolerant neutral late transition metal complexes fact highly active systems produce high-molecular-weight polyethylene polymerize functionalized olefins require cocatalyst
