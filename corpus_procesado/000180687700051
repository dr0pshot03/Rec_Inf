modulation heterochromatin protein dynamics primary mammalian cells 
heterochromatin protein hp1beta key component condensed dna strongly implicated gene silencing centromeric cohesion heterochromatin considered static structure stabilizing crucial aspects nuclear organization prohibiting access transcription factors demonstrate fluorescence recovery photobleaching green fluorescent protein-hp1beta fusion protein highly mobile within euchromatin heterochromatin ex vivo resting murine t cells moreover t cell activation greatly increased mobility indicating process may facilitate heterochromatin remodeling permit access epigenetic modifiers transcription factors many genes consequently derepressed
