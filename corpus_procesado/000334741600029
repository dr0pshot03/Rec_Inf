origins functional evolution y chromosomes across mammals 
y chromosomes underlie sex determination mammals repeat-rich nature hampered sequencing associated evolutionary studies trace y evolution across representative mammals basis high-throughput genome transcriptome sequencing uncover three independent sex chromosome originations mammals birds outgroup original placental marsupial therian y containing sex-determining gene sry emerged therian ancestor approximately million years ago parallel first five monotreme y chromosomes carrying probable sex-determining gene amh avian w chromosome arose approximately million years ago bird ancestor small y/w gene repertoires enriched regulatory functions rapidly defined following stratification recombination arrest erosion events remained considerably stable despite expression decreases therians y/w genes show notable conservation proto-sex chromosome expression patterns although various y genes evolved testis-specificities differential regulatory decay thus although genes evolved novel functions spatial/temporal expression shifts y genes probably endured least initially dosage constraints
