lysm-type mycorrhizal receptor recruited rhizobium symbiosis nonlegume parasponia
rhizobium-root nodule symbiosis generally considered unique legumes however one exception parasponia nonlegume rhizobial nodule symbiosis evolved independently legumes induced rhizobium nod factors used parasponia andersonii identify genetic constraints underlying evolution nod factor signaling part signaling cascade downstream nod factor perception recruited more-ancient arbuscular endomycorrhizal symbiosis however legume nod factor receptors activate common signaling pathway essential arbuscular endomycorrhizae show parasponia single nod factor-like receptor indispensable symbiotic interactions therefore conclude nod factor perception mechanism also recruited widespread endomycorrhizal symbiosis
