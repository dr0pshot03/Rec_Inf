sustaining fisheries yields evolutionary time scales
fishery management plans ignore potential evolutionary change harvestable biomass subjected populations exploited fish menidia menidia large small random size-selective harvest adults four generations harvested biomass evolved rapidly directions counter size-dependent force fishing mortality large-harvested populations initially produced highest catch quickly evolved lower yield controls small-harvested populations reverse shifts caused selection genotypes slower faster rates growth management tools preserve natural genetic variation necessary long-term sustainable yield
