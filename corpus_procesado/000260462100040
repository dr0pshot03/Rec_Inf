low-speed fracture instabilities brittle crystal
brittle material loaded limit strength fails nucleation propagation crack conditions crack propagation created stress concentration region crack tip depend macroscopic parameters geometry dimensions specimen way crack propagates however entirely determined atomic scale phenomena brittle crack tips atomically sharp propagate breaking variously oriented interatomic bonds one time point moving crack front physical interplay multiple length scales makes brittle fracture complex multi-scale phenomenon several intermediate scales may arise complex situations example presence microdefects grain boundaries occurrence various instabilities crack propagation high speeds well known significant advances made recently understanding origin investigate low speed propagation instabilities silicon using quantum mechanical hybrid multi scale modelling single crystal fracture experiments simulations predict crack tip reconstruction makes low speed crack propagation unstable cleavage plane conventionally thought stable cleavage plane perform experiments instability observed range low speeds using experimental technique designed investigation fracture low tensile loads simulations explain conversely moderately high speeds crack propagation cleavage plane becomes unstable deflects onto planes previously observed experimentally
