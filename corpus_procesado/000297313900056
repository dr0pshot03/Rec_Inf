stress-related noradrenergic activity prompts large-scale neural network reconfiguration
acute stress shifts brain state fosters rapid defense mechanisms stress-related neuromodulators thought trigger change altering properties large-scale neural populations throughout brain investigated brain-state shift humans exposure fear-related acute stressor responsiveness interconnectivity within network including cortical frontoinsular dorsal anterior cingulate inferotemporal temporoparietal subcortical amygdala thalamus hypothalamus midbrain regions increased function stress response magnitudes beta-adrenergic receptor blockade cortisol synthesis inhibition diminished increase thus findings reveal noradrenergic activation acute stress results prolonged coupling within distributed network integrates information exchange regions involved autonomic-neuroendocrine control vigilant attentional reorienting
