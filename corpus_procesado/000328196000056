fear learning enhances neural responses threat-predictive sensory stimuli 
central nervous system rapidly learns particular stimuli predict imminent danger learning thought involve associations neutral harmful stimuli cortical limbic brain regions though associative neuroplasticity sensory structures increasingly appreciated observed synaptic output olfactory sensory neurons osns individual mice learned particular odor indicated impending foot shock osns first cells olfactory system physically contacting odor molecules nose projecting axons brains olfactory bulb osn output evoked shock-predictive odor selectively facilitated fear conditioning results indicate affective information stimulus can encoded earliest representation nervous system
