global rates marine sulfate reduction implications sub-sea-floor metabolic activities
sulfate reduction globally important redox process marine sediments yet global rates poorly quantified developed artificial neural network trained sulfate profiles constrained geomorphological geochemical maps estimate global sulfate-reduction rate distributions globally teramoles sulfate reduced yearly similar % previous estimates accounting oxidation % organic carbon flux sea floor combined global cell distributions marine sediments results indicate strong contrast sub-sea-floor prokaryote habitats: continental margins global cell numbers sulfate-depleted sediment exceed overlying sulfate-bearing sediment one order magnitude whereas abyss life occurs oxic and/or sulfate-reducing sediments
