high mixing rates abyssal southern ocean 
mixing water masses deep ocean layers can estimated considerations continuity global ocean overturning circulation- averaged ocean basins diffusivity observed small- account global upward flux water high mixing intensities found restricted areas close sills narrow gaps- present observations scotia sea deep ocean basin antarctic peninsula tip south america showing high intensity mixing unprecedented large area using budget calculation whole basin find diffusivity +/ x m s- averaged area x km scotia sea basin rough topography situated just east drake passage strong flow antarctic circumpolar current constricted width high basin-wide mixing intensity area southern ocean may help resolve question abyssal water masses mixed towards surface
