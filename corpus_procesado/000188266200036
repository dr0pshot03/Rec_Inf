reburial fossil organic carbon marine sediments 
marine sediments act ultimate sink organic carbon sequestering otherwise rapidly cycling carbon geologic time-scales sedimentary organic carbon burial appears controlled oxygen exposure time situ much research focused understanding mechanisms preservation organic carbon context combustion derived black carbon received attention form refractory organic carbon may preferentially preserved soils sediments however little understood environmental roles transport distribution black carbon apply isotopic analyses graphitic black carbon samples isolated pre industrial marine terrestrial sediments find material terrestrially derived almost entirely depleted radiocarbon suggesting graphite weathered rocks rather combustion product widespread presence fossil graphitic black carbon sediments therefore probably led significant overestimates burial combustion-derived black carbon marine sediments responsible biasing radiocarbon dating sedimentary organic carbon also reveals closed loop carbon cycle depending susceptibility oxidation recycled carbon may locked away biologically mediated carbon cycle many geologic cycles
