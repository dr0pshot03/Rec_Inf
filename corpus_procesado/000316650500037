dusty starburst galaxies early universe revealed gravitational lensing
past decade understanding galaxy evolution revolutionized discovery luminous dusty starburst galaxies times abundant early universe present however difficult measure complete redshift distribution objects especially highest redshifts z> report redshift survey wavelength three millimetres targeting carbon monoxide line emission star-forming molecular gas direction extraordinarily bright millimetre-wave-selected sources high-resolution imaging demonstrates sources strongly gravitationally lensed foreground galaxies detect spectral lines sources multiple lines sources obtain robust unambiguous redshifts least sources found lie z > indicating fraction dusty starburst galaxies high redshifts greater previously thought models lens geometries sample indicate background objects ultra-luminous infrared galaxies powered extreme bursts star formation
