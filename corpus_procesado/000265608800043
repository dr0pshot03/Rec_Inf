gamma-secretase heterogeneity aph1 subunit: relevance alzheimers disease 
gamma-secretase complex plays role alzheimers disease cancer progression development clinically useful inhibitors however complicated role gamma-secretase complex regulated intramembrane proteolysis notch essential proteins different gamma-secretase complexes containing different presenilin aph1 protein subunits present various tissues show complexes heterogeneous biochemical physiological properties specific inactivation aph1b gamma-secretase mouse alzheimers disease model led improvements alzheimers disease-relevant phenotypic features without notch-related side effects aph1b complex contributes total gamma-secretase activity human brain thus specific targeting aph1b-containing gamma-secretase complexes may help generate less toxic therapies alzheimers disease
