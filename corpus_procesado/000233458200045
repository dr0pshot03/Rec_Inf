probing carrier dynamics nanostructures picosecond cathodoluminescence 
picosecond femtosecond spectroscopy allow detailed study carrier dynamics nanostructured materials1 experiments laser pulse normally excites several nanostructures however spectroscopic information may also acquired using pulses electron beam modern electron microscope exploiting phenomenon called cathodoluminescence approach offers several advantages multimode imaging capabilities electron microscope enable correlation optical properties via cathodoluminescence surface morphology secondary electron mode nanometre scale2 broad energy range electrons can excite wide-bandgap materials diamond gallium-nitride-based structures easily excited conventional optical means perhaps intriguingly small beam can probe single selected nanostructure apply original time-resolved cathodoluminescence set-up describe carrier dynamics within single gallium-arsenide-based pyramidal nanostructures3 time resolution picoseconds spatial resolution nanometres behaviour charge carriers useful evaluating elementary components quantum computers45 optical quantum gates6 single photon sources7- quantum cryptography10
