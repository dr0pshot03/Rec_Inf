synaptic scaling mediated glial tnf-alpha 
two general forms synaptic plasticity operate different timescales thought contribute activity-dependent refinement neural circuitry development: long-term potentiation ltp long-term depression ltd involve rapid adjustments strengths individual synapses response specific patterns correlated synaptic activity homeostatic synaptic scaling entails uniform adjustments strength synapses cell response prolonged changes cells electrical activity without homeostatic synaptic scaling neural networks can become unstable perform suboptimally- although much known mechanisms underlying ltp ltd4 little known mechanisms responsible synaptic scaling except scaling due least part alterations receptor content synapses- show synaptic scaling response prolonged blockade activity mediated pro-inflammatory cytokine tumour-necrosis factor-alpha tnf-alpha using mixtures wild-type tnf-alpha-deficient neurons glia also show glia source tnf-alpha required form synaptic scaling suggest modulating tnf-alpha levels glia actively participate homeostatic activity-dependent regulation synaptic connectivity
