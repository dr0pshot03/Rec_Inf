structure mechanism na+-independent amino acid transporter 
amino acid polyamine organocation apc transporters secondary transporters play essential roles nutrient uptake neurotransmitter recycling ionic homeostasis regulation cell volume present crystal structure apo-apct proton-coupled broad-specificity amino acid transporter angstrom resolution structure contains transmembrane helices first consisting inverted structural repeat transmembrane helices like leucine transporter leut apct structure reveals inward-facing apo state amine moiety lysine- located position equivalent sodium ion site na2 leut propose lysine- central proton-coupled transport amine group serves functional role na2 ion leut thus demonstrating common principles among proton-and sodium-coupled transporters
