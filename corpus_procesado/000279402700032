hydrated electron occupy cavity 
since discovery hydrated electron years ago general consensus emerged hydrated electron occupies quasispherical cavity liquid water simulated electronic structure dynamics hydrated electron using rigorously derived pseudopotential treat electron-water interaction incorporates attractive oxygen repulsive hydrogen features included previous pseudopotentials emerged hydrated electron reside cavity instead occupied similar -nanometer-diameter region enhanced water density calculated ground-state absorption spectrum excited-state spectral dynamics simulated photoexcitation noncavity hydrated electron showed excellent agreement experiment relaxation pathway involves rapid internal conversion followed slow ground-state cooling opposite mechanism implicated simulations hydrated electron occupies cavity
