geometric origin hexagonal close packing grain boundary gold
using electron microscopy identify local intergranular regions hexagonal close-packing grain boundary gold analyzing topological defects connect layer adjacent face-centered cubic grains explain geometric origin interfacial reconstruction extend analysis predict stacking arrangements found range intergranular misorientations results help unify understanding defects control behavior polycrystalline materials showing line defects already well understood bulk also can determine atomic arrangements grain boundaries
