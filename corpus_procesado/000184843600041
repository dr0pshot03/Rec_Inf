trans-synaptic shift anion gradient spinal lamina neurons mechanism neuropathic pain 
modern pain-control theory predicts loss inhibition disinhibition dorsal horn spinal cord crucial substrate chronic pain syndromes however nature mechanisms underlie disinhibition remained controversial- present evidence novel mechanism disinhibition following peripheral nerve injury involves trans-synaptic reduction expression potassium-chloride exporter kcc2 consequent disruption anion homeostasis neurons lamina superficial dorsal horn one main spinal nociceptive output pathways experiments resulting shift transmembrane anion gradient caused normally inhibitory anionic synaptic currents excitatory substantially driving net excitability lamina neurons local blockade knock-down spinal kcc2 exporter intact rats markedly reduced nociceptive threshold confirming reported disruption anion homeostasis lamina neurons sufficient cause neuropathic pain
