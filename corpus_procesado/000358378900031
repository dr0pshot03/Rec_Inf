small-scale filament eruptions driver x-ray jets solar coronal holes
solar x-ray jets thought made burst reconnection closed magnetic field base jet ambient open field accepted version emerging-flux model reconnection occurs plasma current sheet open field emerging closed field also forms localized x-ray brightening usually observed edge jets base report high-resolution x-ray extreme-ultraviolet observations randomly selected x-ray jets form coronal holes suns poles jet contrary emerging-flux model miniature version filament eruptions initiate coronal mass ejections- drives jet-producing reconnection x-ray bright point occurs reconnection legs minifilament-carrying erupting closed field analogous formation solar flares larger-scale eruptions previous observations found jets driven base-field eruptions- one study one jet provisionally questioned emerging-flux model observations support view solar filament eruptions formed fundamental explosive magnetic process occurs vast range scales biggest mass ejections flare eruptions x-ray jets perhaps even smaller jets may power coronal heating similar scenario previously suggested inferred different observations based different origin erupting minifilament
