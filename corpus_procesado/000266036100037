white organic light-emitting diodes fluorescent tube efficiency
development white organic light-emitting diodes oleds holds great promise production highly efficient large-area light sources high internal quantum efficiencies conversion electrical energy light realized- nevertheless overall device power efficiencies still considerably lumens per watt fluorescent tubes current benchmark novel light sources although reports highly power-efficient white oleds exist details structure measurement conditions structures fully disclosed: highest power efficiency reported scientific literature lm w ref report improved oled structure reaches fluorescent tube efficiency combining carefully chosen emitter layer high-refractive-index substrates using periodic outcoupling structure achieve device power efficiency lm w candelas per square metre efficiency potential raised lm w light outcoupling can improved besides approaching internal quantum efficiency values one also focused reducing energetic ohmic losses occur electron-photon conversion anticipate results will starting point research leading white oleds efficiencies beyond lm w- make white-light oleds soft area light high colour-rendering qualities light sources choice future
