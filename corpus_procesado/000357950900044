noisy linear map underlies oscillations cell size gene expression bacteria 
bacterial growth cell approximately doubles size division splits two daughter cells process subjected inherent perturbations cellular noise12 thus requires regulation cell-size homeostasis mechanisms underlying control dynamics cell size remain poorly understood owing difficulty sizing individual bacteria long periods time high-throughput manner measure analyse long-term single-cell growth division across different escherichia coli strains growth conditions3 show subset cells population exhibit transient oscillations cell size periods stretch across several ten generations analysis reveals simple law governing cell-size control-a noisy linear map-explains origins cell-size oscillations across strains noisy linear map implements negative feedback cell-size control: cell larger initial size tends divide earlier whereas one smaller initial size tends divide later combining simulations cell growth division experimental data demonstrate noisy linear map generates transient oscillations just cell size also constitutive gene expression work provides new insights dynamics bacterial cell-size regulation implications physiological processes involved
