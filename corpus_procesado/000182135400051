near-perfect elastoplasticity pure nanocrystalline copper 
ductile metals alloys undergo plastic yielding room temperature exhibit work-hardening generation surface instabilities lead necking failure show pure nanocrystalline copper behaves differently displaying near-perfect elastoplastic behavior characterized newtonian flow absence work-hardening neck formation observed behavior tensile tests fully dense large-scale bulk nanocrystalline samples experimental results understanding unique mechanical properties nanocrystalline materials also provide basis commercial technologies plastic superplastic formation materials
