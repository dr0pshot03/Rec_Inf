extremely primitive star galactic halo 
early universe chemical composition consisting hydrogen helium traces lithium almost elements subsequently created stars supernovae mass fraction elements massive helium z known metallicity number metal-poor stars found low iron abundance rich carbon nitrogen oxygen- theoretical reasons observed absence stars z<5x10- suggested low-mass stars form primitive interstellar medium enriched critical value z estimated lie range 5x10- 5x10- ref although competing theories claiming contrary exist use low-mass mean stellar mass less solar masses stars survive present day report chemical composition star galactic halo low z < 9x10- 5x10- times sun chemical pattern typical classical extremely metal-poor stars-that without enrichment carbon nitrogen oxygen shows low-mass stars can formed low metallicity critical value z lithium detected suggesting low-metallicity extension previously observed trend lithium depletion lithium depletion implies stellar material must experienced temperatures two million kelvin history given necessary destroy lithium
