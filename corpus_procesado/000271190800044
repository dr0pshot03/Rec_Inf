acceleration neutral atoms strong short-pulse laser fields
charged particle exposed oscillating electric field experiences force proportional cycle-averaged intensity gradient so-called ponderomotive force plays major part variety physical situations paul traps charged particles electron diffraction strong standing laser fields- kapitza-dirac effect laser-based particle acceleration- comparably weak forces neutral atoms inhomogeneous light fields may arise dynamical polarization atom- physically similar cycle-averaged forces observe previously unconsidered extremely strong kinematic forces neutral atoms short-pulse laser fields identify ponderomotive force electrons driving mechanism leading ultrastrong acceleration neutral atoms magnitude high similar times earths gravitational acceleration g knowledge far highest observed acceleration neutral atoms external fields may lead new applications fundamental applied physics
