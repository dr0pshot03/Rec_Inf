s-nitrosylation matrix metalloproteinases: signaling pathway neuronal cell death 
matrix metalloproteinases mmps implicated pathogenesis neurodegenerative diseases stroke however mechanism mmp activation remains unclear report mmp activation involves s-nitrosylation cerebral ischemia vivo mmp- colocalized neuronal nitric oxide synthase s-nitrosylation activated mmp- vitro induced neuronal apoptosis mass spectrometry identified active derivative mmp- vitro vivo stable sulfonic sulfonic acid whose formation triggered s-nitrosylation findings suggest potential extracellular proteolysis pathway neuronal cell death s-nitrosylation activates mmps oxidation results stable posttranslational modification pathological activity
