multigate transistors future classical metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors
four decades transistors shrinking exponentially size therefore number transistors single microelectronic chip increasing exponentially increase packing density made possible continually shrinking metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor mosfet current generation transistors transistor dimensions shrunk extent electrical characteristics device can markedly degraded making unlikely exponential decrease transistor size can continue recently however new generation mosfets called multigate transistors emerged multigate geometry will allow continuing enhancement computer performance next decade
