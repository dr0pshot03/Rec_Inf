synthetic genetic polymers capable heredity evolution
genetic information storage processing rely just two polymers dna rna yet whether role reflects evolutionary history fundamental functional constraints currently unknown use polymerase evolution design show genetic information can stored recovered six alternative genetic polymers based simple nucleic acid architectures found nature [xeno-nucleic acids xnas] also select xna aptamers bind targets high affinity specificity demonstrating beyond heredity specific xnas capacity darwinian evolution folding defined structures thus heredity evolution two hallmarks life limited dna rna likely emergent properties polymers capable information storage
