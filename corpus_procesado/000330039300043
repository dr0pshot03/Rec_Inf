strong ground motion prediction using virtual earthquakes
sedimentary basins increase damaging effects earthquakes trapping amplifying seismic waves simulations seismic wave propagation sedimentary basins capture effect however exists method validate results earthquakes yet occurred present new approach ground motion prediction uses ambient seismic field apply method suite magnitude scenario earthquakes southern san andreas fault compare ground motion predictions simulations methods find strong amplification coupling source structure effects predict substantially different shaking patterns across los angeles basin virtual earthquake approach provides new approach predicting long-period strong ground motion
