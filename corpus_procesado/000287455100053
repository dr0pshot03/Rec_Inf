capillary forces suspension rheology
rheology suspensions solid particles dispersed fluid controlled primarily volume fraction solids show addition small amounts secondary fluid immiscible continuous phase suspension causes agglomeration due capillary forces creates particle networks dramatically altering bulk rheological behavior predominantly viscous weakly elastic highly elastic gel-like universal phenomenon observed rich variety particle/liquid systems independent whether second liquid wets particles better worse primary liquid admixtures form stable suspensions settling otherwise occur may serve precursor microporous polymer foams lightweight ceramics
