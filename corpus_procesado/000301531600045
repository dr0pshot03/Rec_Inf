role driving energy delocalized states charge separation organic semiconductors 
electron-hole pair created via photon absorption organic photoconversion systems must overcome coulomb attraction achieve long-range charge separation show process facilitated formation excited delocalized band states experiments organic photovoltaic cells states accessed short time < picosecond via infrared ir optical excitation electron-hole pairs bound heterojunction atomistic modeling showed ir photons promote bound charge pairs delocalized band states similar formed just singlet exciton dissociation indicates states act gateway charge separation results suggest charge separation efficient organic photoconversion systems occurs hot-state charge delocalization rather energy-gradient-driven intermolecular hopping
