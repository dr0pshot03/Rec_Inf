snp map human genome generated reduced representation shotgun sequencing
genomic variation attributable single nucleotide polymorphisms snps therefore offer highest resolution tracking disease genes population history- proposed dense map - snps can used scan human genome haplotypes associated common diseases- describe simple powerful method called reduced representation shotgun rrs sequencing creating snp maps rrs re-samples specific subsets genome several individuals compares resulting sequences using highly accurate snp detection algorithm method can extended alignment available genome sequence increasing yield snps providing map positions methods used snp consortium international collaboration academic centres pharmaceutical companies private foundation discover release least human snps discovered human snps rrs total consortium identified snps broadly rrs facilitates rapid inexpensive construction snp maps biomedically agriculturally important species snps discovered rrs also offer unique advantages large-scale genotyping
