synchronous x-ray radio mode switches: rapid global transformation pulsar magnetosphere
pulsars emit low-frequency radio waves high-energy gamma-rays generated anywhere stellar surface edge magnetosphere detecting correlated mode changes across electromagnetic spectrum therefore key understanding physical relationship among emission sites simultaneous observations detected synchronous switching radio x-ray emission properties psr b0943+ pulsar sustained radio-bright mode x-rays show unpulsed nonthermal component conversely pulsar radio-quiet mode x-ray luminosity doubles % pulsed thermal component observed along nonthermal component indicates rapid global changes conditions magnetosphere challenge proposed pulsar emission theories
