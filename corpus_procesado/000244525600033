mapk-mediated bimodal gene expression adaptive gradient sensing yeast 
mating pathway saccharomyces cerevisiae focus considerable research effort yet many quantitative aspects regulation still remain unknown using integrated approach involving experiments microfluidic chips computational modelling studied gene expression phenotypic changes associated mating response well-defined pheromone gradients report combination switch-like graded pathway responses leading stochastic phenotype determination specific range pheromone concentrations furthermore show responses critically dependent mitogen-activated protein kinase mapk-mediated regulation activity pheromone-response-specific transcription factor ste12 well autoregulatory feedback ste12 particular switch-like characteristics sensitivity gene expression shmooing cells pheromone concentration significantly diminished cells lacking kss1 one map kinases activated mating pathway addition dynamic range gradient sensing kss1-deficient cells reduced compared wild type thus provide unsuspected functional significance kinase regulation mating response
