global tissue revolutions morphogenetic movement controlling elongation
polarized cell behaviors drive axis elongation animal embryos mechanisms underlying elongation many tissues remain unknown eggs drosophila undergo elongation sphere ellipsoid oogenesis used live imaging follicles developing eggs elucidate cellular basis egg elongation find elongating follicles undergo repeated rounds circumferential rotation around long axes follicle epithelia mutant integrin collagen iv fail rotate elongate results round eggs present evidence polarized rotation required build polarized fibrillar extracellular matrix ecm constrains tissue shape thus global tissue rotation morphogenetic behavior uses planar polarity information ecm control tissue elongation
