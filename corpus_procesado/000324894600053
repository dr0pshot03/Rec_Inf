cocaine disinhibits dopamine neurons potentiation gaba transmission ventral tegmental area
drug-evoked synaptic plasticity mesolimbic system reshapes circuit function drives drug-adaptive behavior much research focused excitatory transmission ventral tegmental area vta nucleus accumbens nac drug-evoked synaptic plasticity inhibitory transmission affects circuit adaptations remains unknown found medium spiny neurons expressing dopamine da receptor type d1r-msns nac project vta strongly preferring gaba neurons vta repeated vivo exposure cocaine evoked synaptic potentiation synapse occluding homosynaptic inhibitory long-term potentiation activity vta gaba neurons thus reduced da neurons disinhibited cocaine-evoked potentiation gaba release d1r-msns affected drug-adaptive behavior identifies neurons promising target novel addiction treatments
