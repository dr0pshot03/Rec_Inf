leading-edge vortex lifts swifts
current understanding birds fly must revised birds use hand-wings unconventional way generate lift drag physical models common swift wing gliding posture 60degrees sweep sharp hand-wing leading edge tested water tunnel interactions flow measured quantitatively digital particle image velocimetry reynolds numbers realistic gliding flight swift results show gliding swifts can generate stable leading-edge vortices small 5degrees 10degrees angles attack suggest flow around arm-wings birds can remain conventionally attached whereas swept-back hand-wings generate lift leading-edge vortices
