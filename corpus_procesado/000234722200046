magnetosomes cell membrane invaginations organized actin-like protein mamk
magnetosomes membranous bacterial organelles sharing many features eukaryotic organelles using electron cryotomography found magnetosomes invaginations cell membrane flanked network cytoskeletal filaments filaments appeared composed mamk homolog bacterial actin-like protein mreb formed filaments vivo mamk deletion strain magnetosome-associated cytoskeleton absent individual magnetosomes longer organized chains thus seems prokaryotes can use cytoskeletal filaments position organelles within cell
