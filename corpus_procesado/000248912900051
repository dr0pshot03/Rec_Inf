effects molecular noise size control variability budding yeast cell cycle
molecular noise gene expression can generate substantial variability protein concentration however effect precision natural eukaryotic circuit control cell cycle remains unclear use single-cell imaging fluorescently labelled budding yeast measure times division budding g1 budding next division variability g1 decreases square root ploidy 1n/2n/4n ploidy series consistent simple stochastic models molecular noise also increasing gene dosage g1 cyclins decreases variability g1 new single-cell reporter cell protein content allows us determine contribution temporal g1 variability deterministic size control smaller cells extending g1 cell size control contributes significantly g1 variability daughter cells mother cells however even daughters size-independent noise largest quantitative contributor g1 variability exit transcriptional repressor whi5 nucleus partitions g1 two temporally uncorrelated functionally distinct steps first step depends g1 cyclin gene cln3 corresponds noisy size control extends g1 small daughters negligible duration mothers second step whose variability decreases increasing cln2 gene dosage similar mothers daughters analysis decomposes regulatory dynamics start transition two independent modules size sensing module timing module predominantly controlled different g1 cyclin
