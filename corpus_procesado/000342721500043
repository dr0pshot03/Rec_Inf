local clue reionization universe 
identifying population galaxies responsible reionization universe long-standing quest astronomy present possible local analog escape fraction ionizing flux % detection confirms existence gaps neutral gas enveloping starburst region candidate contains massive yet highly compact star-forming region gaps likely created unusually strong winds intense ionizing radiation produced extreme object study also validates indirect technique using residual flux saturated low-ionization interstellar absorption lines identifying leaky galaxies direct detection ionizing flux impossible epoch reionization represents highly valuable technique future studies
