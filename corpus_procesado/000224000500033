high-intensity highly coherent soft x-ray femtosecond laser seeded high harmonic beam
synchrotrons decades provided invaluable sources soft x-rays application led significant progress many areas science technology future applications soft x-rays structural biology example anticipate need pulses much shorter duration femtoseconds much higher energy millijoules delivered synchrotrons soft x-ray free-electron lasers fulfil requirements will limited number pressure beamtime therefore likely considerable laser-driven soft x-ray sources offer comparatively inexpensive widely available alternative encountered practical bottlenecks quest high intensities establish characterize soft x-ray laser chain shows bottlenecks can principle overcome combining high optical quality available high-harmonic laser sources seed beam highly energetic soft x-ray laser plasma amplifier produce tabletop soft x-ray femtosecond laser operating hz exhibiting full saturation high energy high coherence full polarization technique readily applicable existing laser-driven soft x-ray facilities
