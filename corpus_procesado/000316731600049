wild pollinators enhance fruit set crops regardless honey bee abundance 
diversity abundance wild insect pollinators declined many agricultural landscapes whether declines reduce crop yields mitigated managed pollinators honey bees unclear found universally positive associations fruit set flower visitation wild insects crop systems worldwide contrast fruit set increased significantly flower visitation honey bees % systems surveyed overall wild insects pollinated crops effectively; increase wild insect visitation enhanced fruit set twice much equivalent increase honey bee visitation visitation wild insects honey bees promoted fruit set independently pollination managed honey bees supplemented rather substituted pollination wild insects results suggest new practices integrated management honey bees diverse wild insect assemblages will enhance global crop yields
