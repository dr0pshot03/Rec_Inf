loophole-free bell inequality violation using electron spins separated kilometres
years ago john bell proved theory nature obeys locality realism can reproduce predictions quantum theory: local-realist theory correlations outcomes measurements distant particles satisfy inequality can violated particles entangled numerous bell inequality tests reported- however experiments reported far required additional assumptions obtain contradiction local realism resulting loopholes- report bell experiment free additional assumption thus directly tests principles underlying bells inequality use event-ready scheme- enables generation robust entanglement distant electron spins estimated state fidelity +/ efficient spin read-out avoids fair-sampling assumption detection loophole use fast random-basis selection spin read-out combined spatial separation kilometres ensure required locality conditions performed trials tested chsh-bell inequality s < found s +/ s quantifies correlation measurement outcomes null-hypothesis test yields probability p local-realist model space-like separated sites produce data violation least large observe even allowing memory devices data hence imply statistically significant rejection local-realist null hypothesis conclusion may consolidated future experiments instance reaching value p require approximately trials observed s improvements experiment used testing less-conventional theories implementing device-independent quantum-secure communication randomness certification
