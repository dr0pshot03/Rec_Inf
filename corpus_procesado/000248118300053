interference two indistinguishable electrons independent sources
much like ubiquitous quantum interference single particle quantum interference two independent indistinguishable particles also possible single particle interference amplitudes particles wave-functions whereas interference two particles direct result quantum exchange statistics interference observed joint probability finding particles two separated detectors injected two spatially separated independent sources experimental realizations two-particle interferometers proposed proposals shown correlations direct signature quantum entanglement spatial degrees freedom two particles orbital entanglement even though interact optics experiments using indistinguishable pairs photons encountered difficulties generating pairs independent photons synchronizing arrival times thus concentrated detecting bunching photons bosons coincidence measurements similar experiments electrons rather scarce cross-correlation measurements partitioned currents emanating one source- yielded similar information obtained auto-correlation shot noise measurements proposal ref electronic analogue historical hanbury brown twiss experiment classical light based electronic mach-zehnder interferometer uses edge channels quantum hall effect regime implement interferometer partitioned two independent mutually incoherent electron beams two trajectories combined four trajectories enclosed aharonov-bohm flux although individual currents fluctuations shot noise measured auto-correlation found independent aharonov-bohm flux cross-correlation current fluctuations two opposite points across device exhibited strong aharonov-bohm oscillations suggesting orbital entanglement two electron beams
