pumping nutrients ocean surface waters action propagating planetary waves
primary productivity oceans limited lack nutrients surface waters nutrients mostly supplied nutrient-rich subsurface waters upwelling vertical mixing ocean gyres mechanisms fully account observed productivity recently upward pumping nutrients action eddies shown account remainder primary productivity however regional studies focused mesoscale -km-scale eddies- analyse remotely sensed chlorophyll sea-surface-height data collected two years show -km-scale planetary waves propagate westward direction oceans associated % observed variability chlorophyll concentration low-frequency large-scale variations removed data enhanced primary production likely explanation observation case propagating disturbances introduce nutrients surface waters global scale-similar nutrient pumping occurs within distinct eddies
