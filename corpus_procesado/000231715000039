fewer genes noncoding rna 
recent studies showing messenger rnas encode proteins finally explain long-standing discrepancy small number protein-coding genes found vertebrate genomes much larger ever-increasing number polyadenylated transcripts identified tag-sampling microarray-based methods exploring role diversity numerous noncoding rnas now constitutes main challenge transcription research
