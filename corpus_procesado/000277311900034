slip subduction megathrust can seismic aseismic two modes slip complementing time space accommodate long-term plate motions although slip almost purely aseismic depths greater km heterogeneous surface strain1- suggests modes slip occur shallower depths aseismic slip resulting steady transient creep interseismic postseismic periods9- thus active faults seem comprise areas slip mostly earthquakes areas mostly slip aseismically size location frequency earthquakes megathrust can generate thus depend aseismic creep taking place fraction long-term slip rate accounts address issue focusing central peru megathrust show pisco earthquake moment magnitude mw ruptured two asperities within patch remained locked interseismic period triggered aseismic frictional afterslip two adjacent patches prominent patch afterslip coincides subducting nazca ridge area also characterized low interseismic coupling seems repeatedly acted barrier seismic rupture propagation past seismogenic portion megathrust thus appears composed interfingering rate-weakening rate-strengthening patches rate-strengthening patches contribute high proportion aseismic slip determine extent frequency large interplate earthquakes aseismic slip accounts much -% slip budget seismogenic portion megathrust central peru return period earthquakes mw pisco area estimated years
