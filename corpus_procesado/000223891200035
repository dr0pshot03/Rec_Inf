mechanism ammonia transport amt/mep/rh: structure amtb angstrom
first structure ammonia channel amt/mep/rh protein superfamily determined angstrom resolution shows channel spans membrane times two structurally similar halves span membrane opposite polarity structures without ammonia methyl ammonia show vestibule recruits nh4+/nh3 binding site nh4+ angstrom-long hydrophobic channel lowers nh4+ pka conducts nh3 favorable interactions nh3 seen within channel use conserved histidines reconstitution amtb vesicles shows amtb conducts uncharged nh3
