haematopoietic stem cells asymmetrically segregate chromosomes retain brdu 
stem cells proposed segregate chromosomes asymmetrically self-renewing divisions older immortal dna strands retained daughter stem cells whereas newly synthesized strands segregate differentiating cells1- stem cells also proposed retain dna labels -bromo--deoxyuridine brdu either segregate chromosomes asymmetrically divide slowly57- however purity stem cells among brdu-label-retaining cells documented tissue immortal strand hypothesis tested system definitive stem cell markers tested hypotheses haematopoietic stem cells hscs can highly purified using well characterized markers administered brdu newborn mice mice treated cyclophosphamide granulocyte colony-stimulating factor normal adult mice days followed days without brdu case less % hscs retained brdu less % brdu-retaining haematopoietic cells hscs revealing brdu poor specificity poor sensitivity hsc marker sequential administration -chloro--deoxyuridine -iodo--deoxyuridine indicated hscs segregate chromosomes randomly division individual hscs culture revealed asymmetric segregation label thus hscs identified basis brdu-label retention retain older dna strands division indicating general properties stem cells
