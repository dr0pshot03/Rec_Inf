tankyrase inhibition stabilizes axin antagonizes wnt signalling 
stability wnt pathway transcription factor beta-catenin tightly regulated multi-subunit destruction complex deregulated wnt pathway activity implicated many cancers making pathway attractive target anticancer therapies however development targeted wnt pathway inhibitors hampered limited number pathway components amenable small molecule inhibition used chemical genetic screen identify small molecule xav939 selectively inhibits beta-catenin-mediated transcription xav939 stimulates beta-catenin degradation stabilizing axin concentration-limiting component destruction complex using quantitative chemical proteomic approach discovered xav939 stabilizes axin inhibiting poly-adp-ribosylating enzymes tankyrase tankyrase tankyrase isoforms interact highly conserved domain axin stimulate degradation ubiquitin-proteasome pathway thus study provides new mechanistic insights regulation axin protein homeostasis presents new avenues targeted wnt pathway therapies
