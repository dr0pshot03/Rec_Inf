dna sequence analysis human chromosome
chromosome highly structurally polymorphic contains largest autosomal block heterochromatin heteromorphic % humans whereas pericentric inversions occur % population finished euchromatic sequence chromosome comprises base pairs represents >% region analysis sequence reveals many intra interchromosomal duplications including segmental duplications adjacent centromere large heterochromatic block annotated genes including genes implicated male-to-female sex reversal cancer neurodegenerative disease pseudogenes chromosome contains largest interferon gene cluster human genome also region exceptionally high gene g + c content including genes paralogous major histocompatibility complex also detected recently duplicated genes exhibit different rates sequence divergence presumably reflecting natural selection
