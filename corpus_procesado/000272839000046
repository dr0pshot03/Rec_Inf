crystal structure eukaryotic strong inward-rectifier k+ channel kir2 angstrom resolution
inward-rectifier potassium k+ channels conduct k+ ions efficiently one direction cell kir2 channels control resting membrane voltage many electrically excitable cells heritable mutations cause periodic paralysis cardiac arrhythmia present crystal structure kir2 chicken excluding unstructured amino carboxyl termini % identical human kir2 crystals containing rubidium rb+ strontium sr2+ europium eu3+ reveal binding sites along ion conduction pathway conductive inhibitory sites correlate extensive electrophysiological data provide structural basis understanding rectification channels extracellular surface large structured turrets unusual selectivity filter entryway might explain relative insensitivity eukaryotic inward rectifiers toxins surface features also suggest possible approach development inhibitory agents specific member inward-rectifier k+ channel family
