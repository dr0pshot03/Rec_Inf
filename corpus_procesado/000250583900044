ordered phosphorylation governs oscillation three-protein circadian clock
simple circadian oscillator found cyanobacteria can reconstituted vitro using three proteins-kaia kaib kaic total phosphorylation level kaic oscillates circadian period mechanism underlying sustained oscillation remains unclear shown four forms kaic differing phosphorylation state appear ordered pattern arising intrinsic autokinase autophosphatase rates kaic modulation kaia kinetic biochemical data indicate one phosphoforms inhibits activity kaia interaction kaib providing crucial feedback sustains oscillation mathematical model constrained experimental data quantitatively reproduces circadian period distinctive dynamics four phosphoforms
