sensitivity perturbations vivo implies high noise suggests rate coding cortex 
well known neural activity exhibits variability sense identical sensory stimuli produce different responses1- difficult determine variability means noise carry important information-about example internal state organism address issue bottom asking whether small perturbations activity cortical networks amplified based vivo whole-cell patch-clamp recordings rat barrel cortex find perturbation consisting single extra spike one neuron produces approximately additional spikes postsynaptic targets also show using simultaneous intra-and extracellular recordings single spike neuron produces detectable increase firing rate local network theoretical analysis indicates amplification leads intrinsic stimulus-independent variations membrane potential order +/ - mv-variations pure noise carry information therefore brain perform reliable computations must either use rate code generate large fast depolarizing events proposed theory synfire chains45 however vivo recordings found events rare findings thus consistent idea cortex likely use primarily rate code
