zfp36l2 required self-renewal early burst-forming unit erythroid progenitors 
stem cells progenitors many lineages undergo self-renewing divisions extracellular intracellular proteins regulate process largely unknown glucocorticoids stimulate red blood cell formation promoting self-renewal early burst-forming unit-erythroid bfu-e progenitors- show rna-binding protein zfp36l2 transcriptional target glucocorticoid receptor gr bfu-es required bfu-e self-renewal zfp36l2 normally downregulated erythroid differentiation bfu-e stage expression maintained tested gr agonists stimulate bfu-e self-renewal gr binds several potential enhancer regions zfp36l2 knockdown zfp36l2 cultured bfu-e cells affect rate cell division disrupted glucocorticoid-induced bfu-e self-renewal knockdown zfp36l2 transplanted erythroid progenitors prevented expansion erythroid lineage progenitors normally seen following induction anaemia phenylhydrazine treatment zfp36l2 preferentially binds messenger rnas induced maintained high expression levels terminal erythroid differentiation negatively regulates expression levels zfp36l2 therefore functions part molecular switch promoting bfu-e self-renewal subsequent increase total numbers colony-forming unit-erythroid cfu-e progenitors erythroid cells generated
