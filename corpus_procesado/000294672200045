synaptic pruning microglia necessary normal brain development
microglia highly motile phagocytic cells infiltrate take residence developing brain thought provide surveillance scavenging function however although microglia shown engulf clear damaged cellular debris brain insult remains less clear role microglia play uninjured brain show microglia actively engulf synaptic material play major role synaptic pruning postnatal development mice findings link microglia surveillance synaptic maturation suggest deficits microglia function may contribute synaptic abnormalities seen neurodevelopmental disorders
