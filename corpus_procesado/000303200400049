sexual selection enables long-term coexistence despite ecological equivalence
empirical data indicate sexual preferences critical maintaining species boundaries- yet theoretical work suggested can minimal role maintaining biodiversity- long-term coexistence within overlapping ranges thought unlikely absence ecological differentiation challenge widely held view generalizing standard model sexual selection include two ubiquitous features populations sexual selection: spatial variation local carrying capacity mate-search costs females show two features combined sexual preferences can single-handedly maintain coexistence even spatial variation local carrying capacity slight might go unnoticed empirically theoretical study demonstrates sexual selection alone can promote long-term coexistence ecologically equivalent species overlapping ranges thus provides novel explanation maintenance species diversity
