controlled exchange interaction pairs neutral atoms optical lattice
ultracold atoms trapped light offer robust quantum coherence controllability providing attractive system quantum information processing simulation complex problems condensed matter physics many quantum information processing schemes require manipulation deterministic entanglement individual qubits typically accomplished using controlled state-dependent coherent interactions among qubits recent experiments made progress towards goal demonstrating entanglement among ensemble atoms confined optical lattice now however demonstration key operation: controlled entanglement atoms isolated pairs use optical lattice double-well potentials isolate manipulate arrays paired rb atoms inducing controlled entangling interactions within pair experiment realizes proposals use controlled exchange coupling system neutral atoms although rb atoms nearly state-independent interactions force two atoms physical location wavefunction exchange symmetry identical bosons leads state-dependent dynamics observe repeated interchange spin atoms occupying different vibrational levels coherence time ten milliseconds observation demonstrates essential component neutral atom quantum swap gate interchanges state two qubits half-implementation root swap gate entangling together single-qubit rotations forms set universal gates quantum computation
