gate-controlled bidirectional spin filter using quantum coherence
demonstrate quantum coherent electron spin filter directly measuring spin polarization emitted current spin filter consists open quantum dot in-plane magnetic field in-plane field gives two spin directions different fermi wavelengths resulting spin-dependent quantum interference transport device gate voltage used select preferentially transmitted spin thus setting polarity filter provides fully electrical method creation detection spin-polarized currents polarizations emitted current high % spin directions either aligned anti-aligned external field observed
