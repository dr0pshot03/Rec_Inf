parallels cytokinesis retroviral budding: role escrt machinery 
cytokinesis dividing animal cells pull apart two daughter cells final stage termed abscission requires breakage midbody thin membranous stalk connecting daughter cells membrane fission event topologically resembles budding viruses hiv- infected cells found two proteins involved hiv- budding-tumor susceptibility gene tsg101 subunit endosomal sorting complex required transport escrt-i alix escrt-associated protein-were recruited midbody cytokinesis interaction centrosome protein cep55 centrosome midbody protein essential abscission tsg101 alix possibly components escrt-i required completion cytokinesis thus hiv- budding cytokinesis use similar subset cellular components carry topologically similar membrane fission events
