mrf4 determines skeletal muscle identity myf5 : myod double-mutant mice 
vertebrates skeletal muscle model acquisition cell fate stem cells two determination factors basic helix loop helixmyogenic regulatory factor mrf family myf5 myod thought direct transition double-mutant mice totally lack skeletal muscle fibres myoblasts- absence factors progenitor cells remain multipotent can change fate gene targeting studies revealed hierarchical relationships mrf genes mrf4 myogenin latter regarded differentiation genes show using allelic series three myf5 mutants differentially affect expression genetically linked mrf4 gene skeletal muscle present new myf5: myod double null mice mrf4 expression compromised finding contradicts widely held view thatmyogenic identity conferred solely bymyf5 myod identifies mrf4 determination gene revise epistatic relationship mrfs myf5 mrf4 act upstream myod direct embryonic multipotent cells myogenic lineage
