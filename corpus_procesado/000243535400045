high-throughput identification catalytic redox-active cysteine residues 
cysteine cys residues often play critical roles proteins; however identification specific functions limited case-by-case experimental approaches developed procedure high-throughput identification catalytic redox-active cys proteins searching sporadic selenocysteine-cys pairs sequence databases method independent protein family structure taxon used selectively detect majority known proteins redox-active cys make additional predictions one verified rapid accumulation sequence information genomic metagenomic projects allow detection many additional oxidoreductase families well identification redox-active cys proteins
