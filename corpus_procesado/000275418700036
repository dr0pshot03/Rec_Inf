near-tip fields fast cracks
stressed body crack propagation main vehicle material failure cracks create large stress amplification tips leading large material deformation material response within highly deformed region will determine mode failure despite great importance limited knowledge structure region generally experimentally intractable using brittle neo-hookean material overcame barrier performed direct precise measurements near-tip structure rapid cracks experiments reveal hierarchy linear nonlinear elastic zones energy transported dissipated cracks tip result provides comprehensive picture remotely applied forces drive material failure fundamental fracture states: straight rapidly moving cracks
