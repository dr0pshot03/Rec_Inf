drosophila mir2 induces pseudo-polysomes inhibits translation initiation 
micrornas mirs inhibit protein synthesis mechanisms yet unresolved- developed cell-free system drosophila melanogaster embryos faithfully recapitulates mir2-mediated translational control means untranslated region d melanogaster reaper messenger rna show mir2 inhibits translation initiation without affecting mrna stability surprisingly mir2 induces formation dense heavier 80s mirnps pseudo-polysomes even polyribosome formation 60s ribosomal subunit joining blocked mrna bearing apppg instead anm gpppg cap structure escapes mir2-mediated translational block results directly show inhibition m gpppg cap-mediated translation initiation mechanism mir2 function uncover pseudo-polysomal messenger ribonucleoprotein assemblies may help explain earlier findings
