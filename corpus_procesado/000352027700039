shape-changing magnetic assemblies high-sensitivity nmr-readable nanoprobes 
fluorescent plasmonic labels sensors revolutionized molecular biology helping visualize cellular biomolecular processes- increasingly probes now designed respond wavelengths near-infrared region reduced tissue autofluorescence photon attenuation enable subsurface vivo sensing even near-infrared region optical resolution sensitivity decrease rapidly increasing depth present sensor design obviates need optical addressability operating nuclear magnetic resonance nmr radio-frequency spectrum signal attenuation distortion tissue biological media negligible background interferences vanish sensors can spatially located using standard magnetic resonance imagingmri equipment radio-frequency-addressable sensor assemblies presented comprise pairs magnetic disks spaced swellable hydrogel material reversibly reconfigure rapid response chosen stimuli give geometry-dependent dynamic nmr spectral signatures sensors can made biocompatible materials detectable low concentrations offer potential responsive nmr spectral shifts close million times greater traditional magnetic resonance spectroscopies inherent adaptability allow shape-changing systems measure numerous different environmental physiological indicators thus providing broadly generalizable mri-compatible radio-frequency analogues optically based probes use basic chemical biological medical engineering research
