structural insight filament formation mammalian septins
septins gtp-binding proteins assemble homo hetero-oligomers filaments although key roles various cellular processes little known concerning structure septin subunits organization polarity septin complexes present structures human sept2 g domain heterotrimeric human sept2-sept6-sept7 complex structures reveal universal bipolar polymer building block composed extended g domain forms oligomers filaments conserved interactions adjacent nucleotide-binding sites and/or amino carboxy-terminal extensions unexpectedly x-ray crystallography electron microscopy showed predicted coiled coils involved required complex and/or filament formation asymmetrical heterotrimers associate head-to-head form hexameric unit nonpolarized along filament axis rotationally asymmetrical architecture septin filaments differs fundamentally cytoskeletal structures
