structure open form e coli mechanosensitive channel angstrom resolution
ion channels gated regulate ion flux cells subject intense interest escherichia coli mechanosensitive channel mscs opens allow rapid ion efflux relieving turgor pressure otherwise destroy cell present angstrom-resolution structure mscs channel open conformation structure pore diameter similar angstroms created substantial rotational rearrangement three transmembrane helices structure suggests molecular mechanism underlies mscs gating decay conductivity prolonged activation support mechanism provided single-channel analysis mutants altered gating characteristics
