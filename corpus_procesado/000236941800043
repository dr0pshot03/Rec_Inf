bolometric infrared photoresponse suspended single-walled carbon nanotube films 
photoresponse electrical conductivity single-walled carbon nanotube swnt film dramatically enhanced nanotube film suspended vacuum show change conductivity bolometric caused heating swnt network electron-phonon interactions lead ultrafast relaxation photoexcited carriers energy incident infrared radiation efficiently transferred crystal lattice presence photoexcited holes electrons rise temperature results change resistance thus photoconductivity experiments used support band picture exciton model excited states carbon nanotubes photoresponse suspended swnt films sufficiently high may function sensitive element ir bolometric detector
