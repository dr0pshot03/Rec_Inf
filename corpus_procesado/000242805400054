slip weak faults rotation regional stress fracture damage zone 
slip unfavourably oriented faults respect remotely applied stress well documented implies faults san andreas fault1 low angle normal faults2 weak compared laboratory-measured frictional strength3 high pore pressure within fault zones cause weakness stress reorientation within close fault necessary allow sufficient fault weakening without occurrence hydrofracture4 field observations major tectonic fault using laboratory experiments numerical modelling show stress rotation occurs within fractured damage zone surrounding faults particular find stress rotation considerable unfavourably oriented weak faults weak fault case damage-induced change elastic properties provides necessary stress rotation allow high pore pressure faulting without inducing hydrofracture
