enhanced upper tropical tropospheric cos: impact stratospheric aerosol layer
carbonyl sulfide cos considered major source stratospheric sulfate aerosol periods volcanic quiescence measured cos tropical tropopause find mixing ratios % larger assumed models enhanced cos levels correlated high concentrations biomass-burning pollutants like carbon monoxide co hydrogen cyanide hcn analysis backward trajectories global maps re statistics suggest biomass-burning emissions transported upward deep convection source enhanced cos upper tropical troposphere
