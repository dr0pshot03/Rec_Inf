microrna multiple-turnover rnai enzyme complex 
animals double-stranded rna-specific endonuclease dicer produces two classes functionally distinct tiny rnas: micrornas mirnas small interfering rnas sirnas mirnas regulate mrna translation whereas sirnas direct rna destruction via rna interference rnai pathway show human cell extracts mirna let naturally enters rnai pathway suggests degree complementarity mirna rna target determines function human let component previously identified mirna-containing ribonucleoprotein particle show rnai enzyme complex let containing complex directs multiple rounds rna cleavage explains remarkable efficiency rnai pathway human cells
