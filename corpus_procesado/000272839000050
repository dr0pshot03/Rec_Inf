universality three four-body bound states ultracold atoms 
certain circumstances three interacting particles may form bound states although general few-body problem analytically solvable so-called efimov trimers appear system three particles resonant two-body interactions binding energies trimers predicted universally connected independent microscopic details interaction exploiting feshbach resonance widely tune interactions trapped ultracold lithium atoms find evidence two universally connected efimov trimers associated four-body bound states total precisely determined three four-body features found inelastic-loss spectrum relative locations either side resonance agree well universal theory whereas systematic deviation universality found comparing features across resonance
