anthropogenic ocean acidification twenty-first century impact calcifying organisms 
todays surface ocean saturated respect calcium carbonate increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations reducing ocean ph carbonate ion concentrations thus level calcium carbonate saturation experimental evidence suggests trends continue key marine organisms corals plankton will difficulty maintaining external calcium carbonate skeletons use models ocean carbon cycle assess calcium carbonate saturation is92a business-as-usual scenario future emissions anthropogenic carbon dioxide projections southern ocean surface waters will begin become undersaturated respect aragonite metastable form calcium carbonate year undersaturation extend throughout entire southern ocean subarctic pacific ocean live pteropods exposed predicted level undersaturation two-day shipboard experiment aragonite shells showed notable dissolution findings indicate conditions detrimental high-latitude ecosystems develop within decades centuries suggested previously
