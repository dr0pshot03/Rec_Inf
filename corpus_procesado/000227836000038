obliquity pacing late pleistocene glacial terminations
-year timescale glacial/interglacial cycles late pleistocene epoch past similar years commonly attributed control variations earths orbit hypothesis inspired models depend earths obliquity similar yr similar kyr orbital eccentricity similar kyr precessional similar kyr fluctuations- emphasis usually eccentricity precessional forcing according contrasting hypothesis glacial cycles arise primarily random internal climate variability- taking two perspectives together currently thirty different models seven late-pleistocene glacial cycles present statistical test orbital forcing hypothesis focusing rapid deglaciation events known terminations according analysis null hypothesis glacial terminations independent obliquity can rejected % significance level whereas corresponding null hypotheses eccentricity precession rejected simplest inference consistent test results ice sheets terminated every second third obliquity cycle times high obliquity similar original proposal milankovitch also present simple stochastic deterministic models describe timing late-pleistocene glacial terminations purely terms obliquity forcing
