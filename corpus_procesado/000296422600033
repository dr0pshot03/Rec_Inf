melanopsin signalling mammalian iris retina
non-mammalian vertebrates intrinsically photosensitive iris thus local pupillary light reflex plr contrast thought plr mammals generally requires neuronal circuitry connecting eye brain report intrinsic component plr fact widespread nocturnal crepuscular mammals mouse intrinsic plr requires visual pigment melanopsin also requires plc beta vertebrate homologue drosophila norpa phospholipase c mediates rhabdomeric phototransduction plcb4-/- genotype addition removing intrinsic plr also essentially eliminates intrinsic light response m1 subtype melanopsin-expressing intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells m1-iprgcs far photosensitive iprgc subtype also largest response light ablating mouse expression trpc6 trpc7 members trp channel superfamily also essentially eliminated m1-iprgc light response intrinsic plr affected thus melanopsin signalling exists iris retina involving plc beta mediated pathway nonetheless diverges two locations
