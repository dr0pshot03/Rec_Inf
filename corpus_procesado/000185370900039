high-performance thin-film transistors using semiconductor nanowires nanoribbons 
thin-film transistors tfts fundamental building blocks rapidly growing field macroelectronics use plastic substrates also increasing importance owing light weight flexibility shock resistance low cost current polycrystalline-si tft technology difficult implement plastics high process temperatures required amorphous-si organic semiconductor tfts can processed lower temperatures limited poor carrier mobility result applications require even modest computation control communication functions plastics addressed existing tft technology alternative semiconductor materials form tfts performance comparable better polycrystalline single-crystal si can processed low temperatures large-area plastic substrates improve existing technologies also enable new applications flexible wearable disposable electronics report fabrication tfts using oriented si nanowire thin films cds nanoribbons semiconducting channels show high-performance tfts can produced various substrates including plastics using low-temperature assembly process approach general broad range materials including high-mobility materials inas inp
