deformation rupture oceanic crust may control growth hawaiian volcanoes 
hawaiian volcanoes formed eruption large quantities basaltic magma related hot spot activity pacific plate despite apparent simplicity parent process emission magma onto oceanic crust resulting edifices display topographic complexity- certain features rift zones large flank slides common hawaiian volcanoes indicating similarities genesis however underlying mechanism controlling process remains unknown use seismological investigations finite-element mechanical modelling show load exerted large hawaiian volcanoes can sufficient rupture oceanic crust intense deformation combined accelerated subsidence oceanic crust weakness volcanic edifice/ oceanic crust interface may control surface morphology hawaiian volcanoes especially existence giant flank instabilities- studies needed determine whether processes occur active intraplate volcanoes
