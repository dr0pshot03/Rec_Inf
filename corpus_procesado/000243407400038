spectropolarimetric diagnostics thermonuclear supernova explosions 
even extragalactic distances shape supernova ejecta can effectively diagnosed spectropolarimetry present results type ia supernovae allow statistical study correlation among geometric structures observable parameters type ia supernovae observations suggest type ia supernova ejecta typically consist smooth central iron-rich core outer layer chemical asymmetries degree peripheral asphericity correlated light-curve decline rate type ia supernovae results lend strong support delayed-detonation models type ia supernovae
