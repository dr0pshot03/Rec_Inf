quantum computing realistically noisy devices
theory quantum computers offer means solving problems intractable conventional computers assuming quantum computer constructed practice required function noisy devices called gates gates cause decoherence fragile quantum states central computers operation goal so-called fault-tolerant quantum computing therefore compute accurately even error probability per gate epg high report simple architecture fault-tolerant quantum computing providing evidence accurate quantum computing possible epgs high three per cent epgs experimentally demonstrated avoid excessive resource overheads required necessary architecture lower epgs needed assuming availability quantum resources comparable digital resources available todays computers show non-trivial quantum computations epgs high one per cent implemented
