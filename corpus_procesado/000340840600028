quantum imaging undetected photons 
information central quantum mechanics particular quantum interference occurs exists information distinguish superposed states mere possibility obtaining information distinguish overlapping states inhibits quantum interference introduce experimentally demonstrate quantum imaging concept based induced coherence without induced emission experiment uses two separate down-conversion nonlinear crystals numbered nl1 nl2 illuminated pump laser creating one pair photons denoted idler signal photon pair created nl1 one photon idler passes object imaged overlapped idler amplitude created nl2 source thus undefined interference signal amplitudes coming two crystals reveals image object photons pass imaged object idler photons nl1 never detected obtain images exclusively signal photons nl1 nl2 interact object experiment fundamentally different previous quantum imaging techniques interaction-free imaging ghostimaging- now photons used illuminate object detected coincidence detection necessary enables probe wavelength chosen range suitable detectors available illustrate show images objects either opaque invisible detected photons experiment prototype quantum information-knowledge can extracted photon never detected
