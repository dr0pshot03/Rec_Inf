synaptic amplifier inflammatory pain spinal dorsal horn
inflammation trauma lead enhanced pain sensitivity hyperalgesia part due altered sensory processing spinal cord synaptic hypothesis hyperalgesia postulates hyperalgesia induced activity-dependent long-term potentiation ltp spinal cord challenged previous studies pain pathways ltp experimentally induced nerve stimulation high frequencies similar hertz however resemble real low-frequency afferent barrage occurs inflammation identified synaptic amplifier origin ascending pain pathway switched-on low-level activity nociceptive nerve fibers model integrates known signal transduction pathways hyperalgesia without contradiction
