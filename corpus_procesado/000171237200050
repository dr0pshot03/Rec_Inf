strand-specific postreplicative processing mammalian telomeres 
telomeres specialized nucleoprotein structures stabilize ends linear eukaryotic chromosomes mammalian cells abrogation telomeric repeat binding factor trf2 dna-dependent protein kinase dna-pk activity causes end-to-end chromosomal fusion thus establishing essential role proteins telomere function show trf2-mediated endcapping occurs telomere replication postreplicative requirement trf2 dna-pkcs catalytic subunit dna-pk confined half telomeres namely produced leading-strand dna synthesis results demonstrate crucial difference postrepticative processing telomeres linked mode replication
