reduced mixing generates oscillations chaos oceanic deep chlorophyll maximum 
deep chlorophyll maxima dcms widespread large parts worlds oceans- deep layers high chlorophyll concentration reflect compromise phytoplankton growth exposed two opposing resource gradients: light supplied nutrients supplied often argued dcms stable features show however reduced vertical mixing can generate oscillations chaos phytoplankton biomass species composition dcms fluctuations caused difference timescales two processes: rapid export sinking plankton withdrawing nutrients euphotic zone slow upward flux nutrients fuelling new phytoplankton production climate models predict global warming will reduce vertical mixing oceans- model indicates reduced mixing will generate variability dcms thereby enhancing variability oceanic primary production carbon export ocean interior
