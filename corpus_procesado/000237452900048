pin proteins perform rate-limiting function cellular auxin efflux
intercellular flow phytohormone auxin underpins multiple developmental processes plants plant-specific pin-formed pin proteins several phosphoglycoprotein pgp transporters crucial factors auxin transport related development yet molecular function pins remains unknown show pins mediate auxin efflux mammalian yeast cells without needing additional plant-specific factors conditional gain-of-function alleles quantitative measurements auxin accumulation arabidopsis tobacco cultured cells revealed action pins auxin efflux distinct pgp rate-limiting specific auxins sensitive auxin transport inhibitors suggests direct involvement pins catalyzing cellular auxin efflux
