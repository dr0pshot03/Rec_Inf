single-crystal metallic nanowires metal/semiconductor nanowire heterostructures 
substantial effort placed developing semiconducting carbon nanotubes- nanowires building blocks electronic devices-such field-effect transistors-that replace conventional silicon transistors hybrid electronics lead stand-alone nanosystems attaching electric contacts individual devices first step towards integration step addressed using lithographically defined metal electrodes-- yet metal contacts define size scale much larger nanometre-scale building blocks thus limiting many potential advantages report integrated contact interconnection solution overcomes size constraint selective transformation silicon nanowires metallic nickel silicide nisi nanowires electrical measurements show single crystal nickel silicide nanowires ideal resistivities muomega cm remarkably high failure-current densities > cm- addition demonstrate fabrication nickel silicide/silicon nisi/si nanowire heterostructures atomically sharp metal-semiconductor interfaces produce field-effect transistors based heterostructures source-drain contacts defined metallic nisi nanowire regions approach fully compatible conventional planar silicon electronics extendable nm scale using crossed-nanowire architecture
