persistence memory drop breakup: breakdown universality
low-viscosity drop breaking apart inside viscous fluid encountered air bubbles entrained thick syrup honey rise break apart experiments simulations theory show breakup conditions interior viscosity can neglected produces exceptional form singularity contrast previous studies drop breakup universality violated final shape breakup retains imprint initial boundary conditions finite interior viscosity matter small cuts form singularity produces unexpectedly long slender thread exterior viscosity large enough however cutoff occur minimum drop radius reaches subatomic dimensions first
