dysregulated humoral immunity nontyphoidal salmonella hiv-infected african adults
nontyphoidal salmonellae major cause life-threatening bacteremia among hiv-infected individuals although cell-mediated immunity controls intracellular infection antibodies protect salmonella bacteremia report high-titer antibodies specific salmonella lipopolysaccharide lps associated lack salmonella-killing hiv-infected african adults killing restored genetically shortening lps target salmonella removing lps-specific antibodies serum complement-mediated killing salmonella healthy serum shown induced specifically antibodies outer membrane proteins killing lost excess antibody salmonella lps added thus study indicates impaired immunity nontyphoidal salmonella bacteremia hiv infection results excess inhibitory antibodies salmonella lps whereas serum killing salmonella induced antibodies outer membrane proteins
