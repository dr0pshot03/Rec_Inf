evasion cd8+ t cells critical superinfection cytomegalovirus 
cytomegalovirus cmv can superinfect persistently infected hosts despite cmv-specific humoral cellular immunity however remains undefined demonstrated superinfection rhesus cmv-infected rhesus macaques rm requires evasion cd8+ t cell immunity virally encoded inhibitors major histocompatibility complex class mhc-i antigen presentation particularly homologs human cmv us2 contrast mhc-i interference dispensable primary infection rm establishment persistent secondary infection cmv-infected rm transiently depleted cd8+ lymphocytes findings demonstrate us2 glycoproteins promote evasion cd8+ t cells vivo thus supporting viral replication dissemination superinfection process complicates development preventive cmv vaccines can exploited cmv-based vector development
