gadd45a promotes epigenetic gene activation repair-mediated dna demethylation
dna methylation epigenetic modification essential gene silencing genome stability many organisms although methyltransferases promote dna methylation well characterized molecular mechanism underlying active dna demethylation poorly understood controversial show gadd45a growth arrest dna-damage-inducible protein alpha nuclear protein involved maintenance genomic stability dna repair suppression cell growth key role active dna demethylation gadd45a overexpression activates methylation-silenced reporter plasmids promotes global dna demethylation gadd45a knockdown silences gene expression leads dna hypermethylation active demethylation oct4 xenopus laevis oocytes gadd45a specifically recruited site demethylation active demethylation occurs dna repair gadd45a interacts requires dna repair endonuclease xpg conclude gadd45a relieves epigenetic gene silencing promoting dna repair erases methylation marks
