cross-bridge spring: can cool muscles store elastic energy 
muscles generate force may act springs providing energy storage drive locomotion although extensible myofilaments implicated sites energy storage show intramuscular temperature gradients may enable molecular motors cross-bridges store elastic strain energy using time-resolved small-angle x-ray diffraction paired situ measurements mechanical energy exchange flight muscles manduca sexta produced high-speed movies x-ray equatorial reflections indicating cross-bridge association myofilaments temperature gradient within flight muscle leads lower cross-bridge cycling cooler regions cross-bridges elastically return energy extrema muscle lengthening shortening helping drive cyclic wing motions results suggest cross-bridges can perform functions contraction acting molecular links elastic energy storage
