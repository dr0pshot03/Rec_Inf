measuring dipolar width across liquid-liquid interfaces molecular rulers 
molecular dynamics simulations previously described physical properties across immiscible liquid-liquid interfaces converge aqueous organic limits1- predictions largely gone untested owing difficulties associated probing buried interfaces x-ray neutron scattering experiments created detailed pictures molecular structure boundaries6- scattering studies probe surface-altered solvent structures affect interfacial solvating properties given surface-mediated solvent properties control interfacial solute concentrations reactivities identifying characteristic dimensions interfacial solvation essential formulating predictive models solution phase surface chemistry use specially synthesized solvatochromic surfactants act molecular rulers9 resonance-enhanced second-harmonic generation10- measure dipolar width weakly strongly associating liquid-liquid interfaces dipolar width describes distance required dielectric environment change one phase another results show polarity converges nonpolar limit subnanometre length scales across water-cyclohexane interface however polarity across strongly associating water--octanol interface dominated nonpolar alkane-like region data call question use continuum descriptions liquids characterize interfacial solvation demonstrate interfacial environments can vary non-additive manner bulk solution limits
