sodium-channel mutation causes isolated cardiac conduction disease 
cardiac conduction disorders slow heart rhythm cause disability millions people worldwide inherited mutations scn5a gene encoding human cardiac sodium na+ channel associated rapid heart rhythms occur suddenly life-threatening- however chief function na+ channel initiate cardiac impulse conduction provide first functional characterization scn5a mutation causes sustained isolated conduction defect pathological slowing cardiac rhythm analysing scn5a coding region identified single mutation five affected family members mutation results substitution cysteine glycine g514c channel protein biophysical characterization mutant channel shows abnormalities voltage-dependent gating behaviour can partially corrected dexamethasone consistent salutary effects glucocorticoids clinical phenotype computational analysis predicts gating defects g514c selectively slow myocardial conduction provoke rapid cardiac arrhythmias associated previously scn5a mutations
