neural mechanisms saccadic suppression 
normal vision gaze leaps detail detail resulting rapid image motion across retina yet unaware motion phenomenon known saccadic suppression recorded neural activity middle temporal middle superior temporal cortical areas saccades identical image motion passive viewing conditions neurons selectively silenced saccadic image motion responded well identical external image motion addition subpopulation neurons reversed preferred direction motion saccades consequently oppositely directed motion signals annul one another motion percepts suppressed
