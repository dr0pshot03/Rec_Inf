experimental entanglement distillation hidden non-locality
entangled states central quantum information processing including quantum teleportation efficient quantum computation quantum cryptography general applications work best pure maximally entangled quantum states however owing dissipation decoherence practically available states likely non-maximally entangled partially mixed pure counter problem various schemes entanglement distillation state purification concentration proposed- demonstrate experimentally distillation maximally entangled states non-maximally entangled inputs using partial polarizers perform filtering process maximize entanglement pure polarization-entangled photon pairs generated spontaneous parametric down-conversion also applied methods initial states partially mixed filtering distilled states demonstrate certain non-local correlations evidenced violation form bells inequality initial states property can said possess hidden non-locality
