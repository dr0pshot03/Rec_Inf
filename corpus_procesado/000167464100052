neurogenesis adult involved formation trace memories
vertebrate brain continues produce new neurons throughout life- rat hippocampus several thousand produced day many die within weeks associative learning can enhance survival however now unknown whether new neurons involved memory formation show substantial reduction number newly generated neurons adult rat impairs hippocampal-dependent trace conditioning task animal must associate stimuli separated time similar reduction affect learning stimuli separated time task hippocampal-independent reduction neurogenesis induce death mature hippocampal neurons permanently alter neurophysiological properties ca1 region long-term potentiation moreover recovery cell production associated ability acquire trace memories results indicate newly generated neurons adult affected formation hippocampal-dependent memory also participate
