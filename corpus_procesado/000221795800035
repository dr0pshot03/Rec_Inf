toward heisenberg-limited spectroscopy multiparticle entangled states
precision spectroscopy quantum system fundamentally limited heisenberg uncertainty relation energy time n systems limit requires quantum-mechanically entangled state describe scalable method spectroscopy can potentially take full advantage entanglement reach heisenberg limit practical advantage spectroscopic information transferred states optimal protection readout noise demonstrate method experimentally three beryllium ions spectroscopic sensitivity attained times high perfect experiment three non-entangled particles
