regulation alternative splicing histone modifications 
alternative splicing pre-mrna prominent mechanism generate protein diversity yet regulation poorly understood demonstrated direct role histone modifications alternative splicing found distinctive histone modification signatures correlate splicing outcome set human genes modulation histone modifications causes splice site switching histone marks affect splicing outcome influencing recruitment splicing regulators via chromatin-binding protein results outline adaptor system reading histone marks pre-mrna splicing machinery
