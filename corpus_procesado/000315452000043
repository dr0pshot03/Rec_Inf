unraveling mechanism protein disaggregation clpb-dnak interaction 
hsp- protein machines clpb play essential role reactivating protein aggregates can otherwise lethal cells although players involved known including dnak/dnaj/grpe chaperone system bacteria details molecular interactions well understood using methyl-transverse relaxation-optimized nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy present atomic-resolution model clpb-dnak complex verified mutagenesis functional assays clpb grpe compete binding dnak nucleotide binding domain grpe binding inhibiting disaggregation dnak turn plays dual role disaggregation subsequent refolding polypeptide chains emerge aggregate basis combined structural-biochemical analysis propose model mechanism protein aggregate reactivation clpb
