elf4 gene controls circadian rhythms flowering time arabidopsis thaliana 
many plants use day length environmental cue ensure proper timing switch vegetative reproductive growth day-length sensing involves interaction relative length day night endogenous rhythms controlled plant circadian clock thus plants defects circadian regulation properly regulate timing floral transition describe gene early flowering elf4 involved photoperiod perception circadian regulation elf4 promotes clock accuracy required sustained rhythms absence daily light/dark cycles elf4 mutants show attenuated expression circadian clock associated cca1 gene thought function central oscillator component addition elf4 plants transiently show output rhythms highly variable period lengths becoming arrhythmic mutations elf4 result early flowering non-inductive photoperiods probably caused elevated amounts constans co gene promotes floral induction
