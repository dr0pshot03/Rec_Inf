compromised hoxa5 function can limit p53 expression human breast tumours
expression p53 gene protects cells malignant transformation whereas control p53 degradation subject intense scrutiny little known factors regulate p53 synthesis show p53 messenger rna levels low large proportion breast tumours seeking potential regulators p53 transcription found consensus hox binding sites p53 promoter transient transfection hox/hoxa5 activated p53 promoter expression hoxa5 epithelial cancer cells expressing wild-type p53 isogenic variants lacking p53 gene led apoptotic cell death moreover breast cancer cell lines patient tumours display coordinate loss p53 hoxa5 mrna protein expression hoxa5 promoter region methylated p53-negative breast tumour specimens conclude loss expression p53 human breast cancer may primarily due lack expression hoxa5
