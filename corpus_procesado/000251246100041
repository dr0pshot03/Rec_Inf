situ determination nanoscale chemistry behavior solid-liquid systems 
many fundamental questions crystal-growth behavior remain unanswered difficulties encountered simultaneously observing phases determining elemental concentrations redistributions crystals nucleate grow nanoscale show obstacles can overcome performing energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy partially molten al-si-cu-mg alloy particles situ heating transmission electron microscope using technique able determine aluminum silicon concentrations change complementary symmetric manner solid-liquid interface function temperature ii directly measure solid liquid-phase compositions equilibrium highly undercooled conditions quantitative comparison thermodynamic calculations liquidus solidus phase boundaries iii provide direct evidence homogeneous nucleation aluminum-rich solid
