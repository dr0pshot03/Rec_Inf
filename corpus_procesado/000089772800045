marine microbial consortium apparently mediating anaerobic oxidation methane 
large fraction globally produced methane converted co2 anaerobic oxidation marine sediments strong geochemical evidence net methane consumption anoxic sediments based methane profiles radiotracer experiments stable carbon isotope data elusive microorganisms mediating reaction yet isolated pathway anaerobic oxidation methane insufficiently understood recent data suggest certain archaea reverse process methanogenesis interaction sulphate-reducing bacteria- provide microscopic evidence structured consortium archaea sulphate-reducing bacteria identified fluorescence situ hybridization using specific 16s rrna-targeted oligonucleotide probes example structured archaeal-bacterial symbiosis archaea grow dense aggregates cells surrounded sulphate-reducing bacteria aggregates abundant gas-hydrate-rich sediments extremely high rates methane-based sulphate reduction apparently mediate anaerobic oxidation methane
