probing meiotic recombination aneuploidy single sperm cells whole-genome sequencing
meiotic recombination creates genetic diversity ensures segregation homologous chromosomes previous population analyses yielded results averaged among individuals affected evolutionary pressures sequenced sperm asian male using newly developed amplification method-multiple annealing looping-based amplification cycles-to phase personal genome map recombination events high resolution nonuniformly distributed across genome absence selection pressure paucity recombination near transcription start sites observed individual sperm indicates phenomenon intrinsic molecular mechanism meiosis interestingly decreased crossover frequency combined increase autosomal aneuploidy observable global per-sperm basis
