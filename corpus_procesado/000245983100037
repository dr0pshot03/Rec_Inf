selective activity-dependent requirement dynamin synaptic vesicle endocytosis 
dynamin neuron-specific guanosine triphosphatase thought critically required fission reaction synaptic vesicle endocytosis unexpectedly mice lacking dynamin able form functional synapses even though postnatal viability limited however spontaneous network activity branched tubular plasma membrane invaginations accumulated capped clathrin-coated pits synapses dynamin -knockout mice synaptic vesicle endocytosis severely impaired strong exogenous stimulation resumed efficiently stimulus terminated thus dynamin -independent mechanisms can support limited synaptic vesicle endocytosis dynamin needed high levels neuronal activity
