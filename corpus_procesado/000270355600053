immune activation life-shortening wolbachia reduced filarial competence mosquitoes 
wolbachia strain wmelpop reduces longevity drosophila melanogaster host introduced mosquito aedes aegypti halves life span show wmelpop induces up-regulation mosquitos innate immune system presence inhibits development filarial nematodes mosquito data suggest wmelpop used global effort eliminate lymphatic filariasis possibly control mosquito-borne parasites immune preactivation inhibits development cost constitutive immune up-regulation may contribute life-shortening phenotype
