real-time prediction hand trajectory ensembles cortical neurons primates
signals derived rat motor cortex can used controlling one-dimensional movements robot arm remains unknown however whether real-time processing cortical signals can employed reproduce robotic device kind complex arm movements used primates reach objects space recorded simultaneous activity large populations neurons distributed premotor primary motor posterior parietal cortical areas non-human primates performed two distinct motor tasks accurate real-time predictions one three-dimensional arm movement trajectories obtained applying linear nonlinear algorithms cortical neuronal ensemble activity recorded animal addition cortically derived signals successfully used real-time control robotic devices locally internet results suggest long-term control complex prosthetic robot arm movements can achieved simple real-time transformations neuronal population signals derived multiple cortical areas primates
