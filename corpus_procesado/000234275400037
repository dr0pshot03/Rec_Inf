separation conversion dynamics four nuclear spin isomers ethylene 
molecules three nuclei nonzero spin exist discrete spin isomers whose interconversion gas phase generally considered improbable studied interconversion process ethylene creating sample depleted b-w nuclear spin isomer separation achieved spatial drift isomer induced resonant absorption narrow-band infrared light evolution depleted sample revealed conversion b-2u b-3u isomers rate linearly proportional pressure rate constant +/ x - s- torr- however almost change observed ag isomer populations results suggest spin conversion mechanism c2h4 via quantum relaxation within inversion symmetry
