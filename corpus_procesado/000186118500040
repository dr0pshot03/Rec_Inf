broadband superconducting detector suitable use large arrays 
cryogenic detectors extremely sensitive wide variety applications- particularly astronomy- difficult integrate large arrays like modern ccd charge-coupled device camera current detectors cosmic microwave background cmb already sensitivities comparable noise arising random arrival cmb photons gains sensitivity needed probe early universe will arise large arrays similar situation encountered wavelengths single-pixel x-ray detectors now resolving power deltae < ev single kev photons future x-ray astronomy missions anticipate need -pixel arrays report demonstration superconducting detector easily fabricated can readily incorporated array sensitivity already within order magnitude needed cmb observations energy resolution similarly close targets required future x-ray astronomy missions
