atomic gold-enabled three-dimensional lithography silicon mesostructures 
three-dimensional 3d mesostructured semiconductors show promising properties applications; however date methods exist synthesize fabricate materials metal can diffuse along semiconductor surfaces even trace amounts can change surface behavior exploited phenomena 3d mesoscale lithography showing one example iterated deposition-diffusion-incorporation gold silicon nanowires forms etchant-resistant patterns process facet-selective producing mesostructured silicon spicules skeletonlike morphology 3d tectonic motifs reduced symmetries atom-probe tomography coupled quantitative measurements indicates existence role individual gold atoms forming 3d lithographic resists compared uniform silicon structures anisotropic spicule requires greater force detachment collagen hydrogels suggesting enhanced interfacial interactions mesoscale
