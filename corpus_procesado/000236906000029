experimental determination entanglement single measurement
nearly protocols requiring shared quantum information quantum teleportation key distribution-rely entanglement distant parties however entanglement difficult characterize experimentally existing techniques including entanglement witnesses bell inequalities disclose entanglement quantum states fail states therefore provide satisfactory results general methods fundamentally different entanglement measures definition quantify amount entanglement state however measures suffer severe disadvantage typically directly accessible laboratory experiments report linear optics experiment directly observe pure-state entanglement measure namely concurrence measurement set-up includes two copies quantum state: twin states prepared polarization momentum degrees freedom two photons concurrence measured single local measurement just one photons
