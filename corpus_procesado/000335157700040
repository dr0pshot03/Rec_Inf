faster decomposition increased atmospheric co2 limits soil carbon storage
soils contain largest pool terrestrial organic carbon c major source atmospheric carbon dioxide co2 thus may play key role modulating climate change rising atmospheric co2 expected stimulate plant growth soil c input may also alter microbial decomposition combined effect responses long-term c storage unclear combining meta-analysis data assimilation show atmospheric co2 enrichment stimulates input +% turnover c soil +% increase soil c turnover rising co2 leads lower equilibrium soil c stocks expected rise soil c input alone indicating general mechanism limiting c accumulation soil
