conserved regulation cardiac calcium uptake peptides encoded small open reading frames 
small open reading frames smorfs short dna sequences able encode small peptides less amino acids study elements neglected despite thousands existing genomes others previously showed peptides short amino acids translated provide essential functions insect development describe two peptides less amino acids regulating calcium transport hence influencing regular muscle contraction drosophila heart peptides seem conserved million years range species flies humans implicated cardiac pathologies conservation suggests mechanisms heart regulation ancient smorfs may fundamental genome component studied systematically
