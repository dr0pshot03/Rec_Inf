mitochondrial biogenesis mammals: role endogenous nitric oxide 
nitric oxide found trigger mitochondrial biogenesis cells diverse brown adipocytes 3t3-l1 u937 hela cells effect nitric oxide dependent guanosine -monophosphate cgmp mediated induction peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1alpha master regulator mitochondrial biogenesis moreover mitochondrial biogenesis induced exposure cold markedly reduced brown adipose tissue endothelial nitric oxide synthase null-mutant enos-/- mice reduced metabolic rate accelerated weight gain compared wild-type mice thus nitric oxide-cgmp-dependent pathway controls mitochondrial biogenesis body energy balance
