atomically precise bottom-up fabrication graphene nanoribbons 
graphene nanoribbons-narrow straight-edged stripes graphene single-layer graphite-are predicted exhibit electronic properties make attractive fabrication nanoscale electronic devices- particular although twodimensional parent material graphene exhibits semimetallic behaviour quantum confinement edge effects render graphene nanoribbons widths smaller nm semiconducting exploring potential graphene nanoribbons hampered limited availability: although made using chemical- sonochemical lithographic methods well unzipping carbon nanotubes- reliable production graphene nanoribbons smaller nm chemical precision remains significant challenge report simple method production atomically precise graphene nanoribbons different topologies widths uses surface-assisted coupling molecular precursors linear polyphenylenes subsequent cyclodehydrogenation topology width edge periphery graphene nanoribbon products defined structure precursor monomers can designed give access wide range different graphene nanoribbons expect bottom-up approach atomically precise fabrication graphene nanoribbons will finally enable detailed experimental investigations properties exciting class materials even provide route graphene nanoribbon structures engineered chemical electronic properties including theoretically predicted intraribbon quantum dots superlattice structures magnetic devices based specific graphene nanoribbon edge states
