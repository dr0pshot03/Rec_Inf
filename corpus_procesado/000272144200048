innate immune chemically triggered oxidative stress modifies translational fidelity
translational fidelity essential protein cell function requires accurate transfer rna trna aminoacylation purified aminoacyl-trna synthetases exhibit fidelity one error per couplings accuracy trna aminoacylation vivo uncertain however might considerably lower- show mammalian cells approximately % methionine met residues used protein synthesis aminoacylated non-methionyl-trnas remarkably met-misacylation increases tenfold upon exposing cells live non-infectious viruses toll-like receptor ligands chemically induced oxidative stress met misacylated specific non-methionyl-trna families met-misacylated trnas used translation met-misacylation blocked inhibitor cellular oxidases implicating reactive oxygen species ros misacylation trigger among six amino acids tested trna misacylation occurs exclusively met met residues known protect proteins ros-mediated damage propose met-misacylation functions adaptively increase met incorporation proteins protect cells oxidative stress demonstrating unexpected conditional aspect decoding mrna findings illustrate importance considering alternative iterations genetic code
