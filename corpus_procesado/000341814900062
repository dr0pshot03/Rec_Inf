bidirectional switch valence associated hippocampal contextual memory engram
valence memories malleable intrinsic reconstructive property property memory used clinically treat maladaptive behaviours however neuronal mechanisms brain circuits enable switching valence memories remain largely unknown investigated mechanisms applying recently developed memory engram cell-manipulation technique labelled channelrhodopsin chr2 population cells either dorsal dentate gyrus dg hippocampus basolateral complex amygdala bla specifically activated contextual fear reward conditioning groups fear-conditioned mice displayed aversive light-dependent responses optogenetic place avoidance test whereas dg bla-labelled mice underwent reward conditioning exhibited appetitive response optogenetic place preference test next attempt reverse valence memory within subject mice whose dg bla engram initially labelled contextual fear reward conditioning subjected second conditioning opposite valence original dg bla engram reactivated blue light subsequent optogenetic place avoidance preference tests revealed although dg-engram group displayed response indicating switch memory valence bla-engram group switch also evident cellular level change functional connectivity dg engram-bearing cells bla engram-bearing cells thus found dg neurons carrying memory engram given neutral context plasticity valence conditioned response evoked reactivation can reversed re-associating contextual memory engram new unconditioned stimulus opposite valence present work provides new insight functional neural circuits underlying malleability emotional memory
