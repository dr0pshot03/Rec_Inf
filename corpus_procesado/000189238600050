medicago truncatula dmi1 required bacterial fungal symbioses legumes 
legumes form symbiotic associations mycorrhizal fungi nitrogen-fixing soil bacteria called rhizobia several plant genes required transduction rhizobial signals nod factors also necessary mycorrhizal symbiosis describe cloning characterization one gene legume medicago truncatula dmi1 make infections gene encodes novel protein low global similarity ligand-gated cation channel domain archaea protein highly conserved angiosperms ancestral land plants suggest dmi1 represents ancient plant-specific innovation potentially enabling mycorrhizal associations
