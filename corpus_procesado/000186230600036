demonstration conditional gate operation using superconducting charge qubits
following demonstration coherent control quantum state superconducting charge qubit variety qubits based josephson junctions implemented- although solid-state devices currently advanced microscopic qubits based nuclear magnetic resonance ion trap technologies potential scalability former systems together progress coherence times read-out schemes makes strong candidates building block quantum computer recently coherent oscillations microwave spectroscopy capacitively coupled superconducting qubits reported next challenging step towards quantum computation realization logic gates demonstrate conditional gate operation using pair coupled superconducting charge qubits using pulse technique prepare different input states show amplitude can transformed controlled-not c-not gate operation although phase evolution gate operation remains clarified
