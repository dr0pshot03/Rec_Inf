semaphorin 7a promotes axon outgrowth integrins mapks
striking parallels exist immune nervous system cellular signalling mechanisms molecules originally shown critical immune responses also serve neuronal functions similarly neural guidance cues can modulate immune function show semaphorin 7a sema7a membrane-anchored member semaphorin family guidance proteins previously known immunomodulatory effects can also mediate neuronal functions unlike many semaphorins act repulsive guidance cues sema7a enhances central peripheral axon growth required proper axon tract formation embryonic development unexpectedly sema7a enhancement axon outgrowth requires integrin receptors activation mapk signalling pathways findings define previously unknown biological function semaphorins identify unexpected role integrins integrin-dependent intracellular signalling mediating semaphorin responses provide framework understanding interfering sema7a function immune nervous systems
