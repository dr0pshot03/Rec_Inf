circadian rhythm orchestrated histone deacetylase controls hepatic lipid metabolism
disruption circadian clock exacerbates metabolic diseases including obesity diabetes show histone deacetylase hdac3 recruitment genome displays circadian rhythm mouse liver histone acetylation inversely related hdac3 binding rhythm lost hdac3 absent although amounts hdac3 constant genomic recruitment liver corresponds expression pattern circadian nuclear receptor rev-erb alpha rev-erb alpha colocalizes hdac3 near genes regulating lipid metabolism deletion hdac3 rev-erb alpha mouse liver causes hepatic steatosis thus genomic recruitment hdac3 rev-erb alpha directs circadian rhythm histone acetylation gene expression required normal hepatic lipid homeostasis
