spatial organization flow genetic information bacteria 
eukaryotic cells spatially organize mrna processes translation mrna decay much less clear bacterial cells spatial distribution mature mrna remains ambiguous using sensitive method based quantitative fluorescence situ hybridization show caulobacter crescentus escherichia coli chromosomally expressed mrnas largely display limited dispersion site transcription lifetime estimate apparent diffusion coefficients least two orders magnitude lower expected freely diffusing mrna provide evidence c crescentus mrna localization restricts ribosomal mobility furthermore c crescentus rnase e appears associated dna independently mrna substrates collectively findings show bacteria can spatially organize translation potentially mrna decay using chromosome layout template chromosome-centric organization important implications cellular physiology understanding gene expression bacteria
