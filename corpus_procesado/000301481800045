asymmetric spiroacetalization catalysed confined bronsted acids 
acetals molecular substructures contain two oxygencarbon single bonds carbon atom used cells construct carbohydrates numerous molecules distinctive subgroup spiroacetals acetals joining two rings occur broad range biologically active compounds including small insect pheromones complex macrocycles despite numerous methods catalytic asymmetric formation commonly occurring stereocentres approaches exclusively target chiral acetal centre none spiroacetals report design synthesis confined bronsted acids based c--symmetric imidodiphosphoric acid motif enabling catalytic enantioselective spiroacetalization reaction rationally constructed bronsted acids possess extremely sterically demanding chiral microenvironment single catalytically relevant geometrically constrained bifunctional active site catalyst design expected broad utility catalytic asymmetric reactions involving small structurally functionally unbiased substrates
