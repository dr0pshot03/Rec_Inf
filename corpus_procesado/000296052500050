stochastic pulse regulation bacterial stress response 
gene regulatory circuits can use dynamic even stochastic strategies respond environmental conditions examined activation general stress response mediated alternative sigma factor sigmab individual bacillus subtilis cells observed energy stress activates sigmab discrete stochastic pulses increasing levels stress leading higher pulse frequencies perturbing rewiring endogenous system found behavior results three key features sigmab circuit: ultrasensitive phosphorylation switch stochasticity noise activates switch mixed positive negative transcriptional feedback can amplify pulse switch together results show prokaryotes encode signals using stochastic pulse frequency modulation compact regulatory architecture
