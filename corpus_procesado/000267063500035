listeria transcriptional landscape saprophytism virulence
bacterium listeria monocytogenes ubiquitous environment can lead severe food-borne infections recently emerged multifaceted model pathogenesis however bacterium switches saprophyte pathogen largely unknown using tiling arrays rnas wild-type mutant bacteria grown vitro ex vivo vivo analysed transcription entire genome provide complete listeria operon map uncovered far diverse types rnas expected: addition small rnas < nucleotides least two involved virulence mice identified antisense rnas covering several open-reading frames long overlapping untranslated regions discovered riboswitches can act terminators upstream genes listeria reaches host intestinal lumen extensive transcriptional reshaping occurs sigb-mediated activation virulence genes contrast blood prfa controls transcription virulence genes remarkably several non-coding rnas absent non-pathogenic species listeria innocua exhibit expression patterns virulence genes together data unravel successive coordinated global transcriptional changes infection point previously unknown regulatory mechanisms bacteria
