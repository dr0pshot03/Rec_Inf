capturing metastable structures high-rate cycling lifepo4 nanoparticle electrodes 
absence phase transformation involving substantial structural rearrangements large volume changes generally considered key characteristic underpinning high-rate capability battery electrode material apparent contradiction nanoparticulate lifepo4 commercially important cathode material displays exceptionally high rates whereas lithium-composition phase diagram indicates react via kinetically limited two-phase nucleation growth process knowledge concerning equilibrium phases therefore insufficient direct investigation dynamic process required using time-resolved situ x-ray powder diffraction reveal existence continuous metastable solid solution phase rapid lithium extraction insertion nonequilibrium facile phase transformation route provides mechanism realizing high-rate capability electrode materials operate via two-phase reactions
