cyclic carbanionic valence isomer carbocation: diphosphino analogs diaminocarbocations
diaminocarbocations amidinium salts feature three-center pi electron system open planar structure pi electron three-membered cyclic valence isomers carbon atom bears negative charge predicted kilojoules per mate higher energy open form isomer identified yet contrast attempted synthesis diphosphorus analog amidinium salts leads cyclic carbanionic form precedent transformation carbocationic center carbanionic center help heavier main-group elements numerous examples can imagined approach will enable preparation many unknown structural moieties difficult even impossible access corresponding carbon nitrogen series
