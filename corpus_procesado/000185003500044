persistence without pathology phosphoglycan-deficient leishmania major
leishmania infections involve acute phase replication within macrophages typically associated pathology recovery parasites persist long periods can lead severe disease upon reactivation unlike role host factors parasite factors affecting persistence poorly understood leishmania major lacking phosphoglycans lpg2- unable survive sand flies macrophages retained ability persist indefinitely mammalian host without inducing disease l major lpg2- thus provides platform probing parasite factors implicated persistence role disease immunity
