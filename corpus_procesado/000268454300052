macrophage elastase kills bacteria within murine macrophages 
macrophages aptly positioned function primary line defence invading pathogens many organs including lung peritoneum ability phagocytose clear microorganisms well documented12 macrophages possess several substances can kill bacteria including reactive oxygen species nitric oxide antimicrobial proteins3- proposed macrophage-derived proteinases may contribute antimicrobial properties macrophages macrophage elastase also known matrix metalloproteinase mmp12 enzyme predominantly expressed mature tissue macrophages10 implicated several disease processes including emphysema11 physiological functions mmp12 described show mmp12-/- mice exhibit impaired bacterial clearance increased mortality challenged gram-negative gram-positive bacteria macrophage-rich portals entry peritoneum lung intracellular stores mmp12 mobilized macrophage phagolysosomes ingestion bacterial pathogens inside phagolysosomes mmp12 adheres bacterial cell walls disrupts cellular membranes resulting bacterial death antimicrobial properties mmp12 reside within catalytic domain rather within carboxyterminal domain domain contains unique four amino acid sequence exposed beta loop protein required observed antimicrobial activity present study represents knowledge first report direct antimicrobial activity matrix metallopeptidase describes new antimicrobial peptide sequentially structurally unique nature
