molecular mechanisms axon guidance
axons guided along specific pathways attractive repulsive cues extracellular environment genetic biochemical studies led identification highly conserved families guidance molecules including netrins slits semaphorins ephrins guidance cues steer axons regulating cytoskeletal dynamics growth cone signaling pathways still poorly understood elaborate regulatory mechanisms ensure given cue elicits right response right axons right time otherwise ignored regulatory mechanisms place relatively small number guidance factors can used generate intricate patterns neuronal wiring
