alternative splicing event amplifies evolutionary differences vertebrates 
alternative splicing generates extensive transcriptomic proteomic complexity however functions species-and lineage-specific splice variants largely unknown show mammalian-specific skipping polypyrimidine tract-binding protein ptbp1 exon alters splicing regulatory activities ptbp1 affects inclusion levels numerous exons neurogenesis skipping exon reduces ptbp1 repressive activity facilitate activation brain-specific program engineered skipping orthologous exon chicken cells induces large number mammalian-like changes ptbp1 target exons results thus reveal single exon-skipping event rna binding regulator directs numerous changes species results suggest changes contributed evolutionary differences formation vertebrate nervous systems
