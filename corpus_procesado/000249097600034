increased subaerial volcanism rise atmospheric oxygen billion years ago 
hypothesis establishment permanently oxygenated atmosphere archaean-proterozoic transition similar billion years ago occurred oxygen-producing cyanobacteria evolved1 contradicted biomarker evidence presence rocks million years older2 sustain vanishingly low oxygen levels despite near-modern rates oxygen production similar - billion years ago thus requires oxygen sinks must much larger now propose rise atmospheric oxygen occurred predominant sink oxygen archaean era-enhanced submarine volcanism-was abruptly permanently diminished archaean-proterozoic transition observations3- consistent corollary subaerial volcanism became widespread major tectonic episode continental stabilization beginning proterozoic submarine volcanoes reducing subaerial volcanoes6 shift predominantly submarine mix subaerial submarine volcanism similar observed today reduced overall sink oxygen led rise atmospheric oxygen
