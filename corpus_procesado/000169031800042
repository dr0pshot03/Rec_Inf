climate-driven range expansion morphological evolution marine gastropod 
little known phenotypic consequences global climate change despite excellent pleistocene fossil record many taxa used morphological measurements extant pleistocene populations marine gastropod acanthinucella spirata conjunction mitochondrial dna sequence variation living populations determine populations responded phenotypically pleistocene climatic changes northern populations show little sequence variation compared southern populations pattern consistent recent northward range expansion recently recolonized northern populations also contain shell morphologies absent extant southern populations throughout pleistocene fossil record thus contrary traditional expectations morphological evolution occur largely within pleistocene refugia data show geographical range shifts response climatic change can lead significant morphological evolution
