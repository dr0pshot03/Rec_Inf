x-ray nebula associated millisecond pulsar b1957+
detected x-ray nebula around binary millisecond pulsar b1957+ narrow tail corresponding shocked pulsar wind seen interior known halpha bow shock proves long-held assumption rotational energy millisecond pulsars dissipated relativistic winds unresolved x-ray emission likely represents shock winds pulsar companion collide emission indicates efficiency relativistic particles accelerated postshock flow similar young pulsars despite shock proximity much weaker surface magnetic field millisecond pulsar
