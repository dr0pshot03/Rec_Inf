reaction mechanism determines nmda receptor response repetitive stimulation
central excitatory synapses n-methyl-d-aspartate nmda receptors high affinity glutamate produce slowly rising synaptic current response single transmitter pulse additional current second closely timed stimulus show examining kinetics transmitter binding channel gating single-channel currents recombinant nr1/nr2a receptors synaptic response trains impulses determined molecular reaction mechanism receptor rate constants estimated activation reaction predict binding neurotransmitter receptors hesitate similar to4 ms closed high-affinity conformation either proceed towards opening release neurotransmitter equal probabilities half initially fully occupied receptors become active repetitive stimulation elicits currents distinct waveforms depending pulse frequency high-affinity/low-efficiency activation mechanism might serve link stimulation frequency directionality ensuing synaptic plasticity
