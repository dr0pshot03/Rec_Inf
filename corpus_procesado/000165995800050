nonlinear dimensionality reduction locally linear embedding 
many areas science depend exploratory data analysis visualization need analyze large amounts multivariate data raises fundamental problem dimensionality reduction: discover compact representations high-dimensional data introduce locally linear embedding lle unsupervised learning algorithm computes low-dimensional neighborhood-preserving embeddings high-dimensional inputs unlike clustering methods local dimensionality reduction lle maps inputs single global coordinate system lower dimensionality optimizations involve local minima exploiting local symmetries linear reconstructions lle able learn global structure nonlinear manifolds generated images faces documents text
