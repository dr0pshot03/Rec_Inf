magnetic ratchet three-dimensional spintronic memory logic 
one key challenges future electronic memory logic devices finding viable ways moving todays two-dimensional structures hold data x-y mesh cells three-dimensional structures data stored x-y-z lattice cells allow many-fold increase performance suggested solution shift register-a digital building block passes data cell cell along chain conventional digital microelectronics two-dimensional shift registers routinely constructed number connected transistors however three-dimensional devices added process complexity space needed transistors largely cancel benefits moving third dimension physical shift registers intrinsic physical phenomenon used move data near-atomic distances without requiring conventional transistors therefore much preferred demonstrate way implementing spintronic unidirectional vertical shift register perpendicularly magnetized ferromagnets subnanometre thickness similar layers used non-volatile magnetic random-access memory carefully controlling thickness magnetic layer exchange coupling layers form ratchet allows information form sharp magnetic kink soliton unidirectionally pumped shifted one magnetic layer another simple efficient shift-register concept suggests route creation three-dimensional microchips memory logic applications
