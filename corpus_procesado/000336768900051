membrane proteins bind lipids selectively modulate structure function
previous studies established folding structure function membrane proteins influenced lipid environments- lipids can bind specific sites example potassium channels fundamental questions remain however regarding extent membrane protein selectivity towards lipids report mass spectrometry approach designed determine selectivity lipid binding membrane protein complexes investigate mechanosensitive channel large conductance mscl myco-bacterium tuberculosis aquaporin z aqpz ammonia channel amtb escherichia coli using ion mobility mass spectrometry im-ms reports gas-phase collision cross-sections demonstrate folded conformations membrane protein complexes can exist gas phase resolving lipid-bound states rank bound lipids basis ability resist gas phase unfolding thereby stabilize membrane protein structure lipids bind non-selectively high avidity mscl imparting comparable stability however highest-ranking lipid phosphatidylinositol phosphate line proposed functional role mechanosensation aqpz also stabilized many lipids cardiolipin imparting significant resistance unfolding subsequently functional assays show cardiolipin modulates aqpz function similar experiments identify amtb highly selective phosphatidylglycerol prompting us obtain x-ray structure lipid membrane-like environment angstrom resolution structure compared others obtained without lipid bound reveals distinct conformational changes re-position amtb residues interact lipid bilayer results demonstrate resistance unfolding correlates specific lipid-binding events enabling distinction made lipids merely bind modulate membrane protein structure and/or function anticipate findings will important defining selectivity membrane proteins towards lipids also understanding role lipids modulating protein function drug binding
