cilia node mouse embryos sense fluid flow left-right determination via pkd2 
unidirectional fluid flow plays essential role breaking left-right l-r symmetry mouse embryos remained unclear flow sensed embryo report ca2+ channel polycystin pkd2 required specifically perinodal crown cells sensing nodal flow examination mutant forms pkd2 shows ciliary localization pkd2 essential correct l-r patterning whereas kif3a mutant embryos lack cilia failed respond artificial flow restoration primary cilia crown cells rescued response flow results thus suggest nodal flow sensed manner dependent pkd2 cilia crown cells located edge node
