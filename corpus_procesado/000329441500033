face-to-face transfer wafer-scale graphene films 
graphene attracted worldwide interest since experimental discovery preparation large-area continuous graphene film sio2/si wafers free growth-related morphological defects transfer-induced cracks folds remains formidable challenge growth graphene chemical vapour deposition cu foils- emerged powerful technique owing compatibility industrial-scale roll-to-roll technology however polycrystalline nature microscopic roughness cu foils means roll-to-roll transferred films devoid cracks folds high-fidelity transfer direct growth high-quality graphene films arbitrary substrates needed enable wide-ranging applications photonics electronics include devices optoelectronic modulators transistors on-chip biosensors tunnelling barriers direct growth graphene film insulating substrate sio2/si wafer useful purpose current research efforts remain grounded proof-of-concept stage discontinuous nanometre-sized islands can obtained develop face-to-face transfer method wafer-scale graphene films far known way accomplish growth transfer steps one wafer spontaneous transfer method relies nascent gas bubbles capillary bridges graphene film underlying substrate etching metal catalyst analogous method used tree frogs remain attached submerged leaves contrast previous wet- dry transfer results face-to-face transfer done hand compatible size shape substrate approach also enjoys benefit much reduced density transfer defects compared conventional transfer method importantly direct growth spontaneous attachment graphene underlying substrate amenable batch processing semiconductor production line thus will speed technological application graphene
