global-scale coherence modulation radiation-belt electron loss plasmaspheric hiss 
years ago suggested electron loss region radiation belts overlaps region high plasma density called plasmasphere within four five earth radii arises largely interaction electromagnetic plasma wave called plasmaspheric hiss- interaction strongly influences evolution radiation belts geomagnetic storm course many hours days helps return radiation-belt structure quiet pre-storm configuration observations shown long-term electron-loss rate consistent theory temporal spatial dynamics loss process remain directly verified report simultaneous measurements structured radiation-belt electron losses hiss phenomenon causes losses losses observed form bremsstrahlung x-rays generated hiss-scattered electrons colliding earths atmosphere removal radiation belts results show changes order magnitude dynamics electron loss arising hiss occur timescales short one twenty minutes association modulations plasma density magnetic field furthermore loss dynamics coherent hiss dynamics spatial scales comparable size plasmasphere nearly global-scale coherence predicted may affect short-term evolution radiation belts active times
