network anatomy vivo physiology visual cortical neurons
cerebral cortex local circuits consist tens thousands neurons makes thousands synaptic connections perhaps biggest impediment understanding networks wiring diagrams interconnections even partial complete wiring diagram however understanding network also require information neurons function show relationship structure function can studied cortex combination vivo physiology network anatomy used two-photon calcium imaging characterize functional property-the preferred stimulus orientation-of group neurons mouse primary visual cortex large-scale electron microscopy serial thin sections used trace portion neurons local network consistent prediction recent physiological experiments inhibitory interneurons received convergent anatomical input nearby excitatory neurons broad range preferred orientations although weak biases rejected
