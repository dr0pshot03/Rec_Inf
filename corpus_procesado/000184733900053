optical microcavities
optical microcavities confine light small volumes resonant recirculation devices based optical microcavities already indispensable wide range applications studies example microcavities made active iii-v semiconductor materials control laser emission spectra enable long-distance transmission data optical fibres also ensure narrow spot-size laser read/write beams cd dvd players quantum optical devices microcavities can coax atoms quantum dots emit spontaneous photons desired direction can provide environment dissipative mechanisms spontaneous emission overcome quantum entanglement radiation matter possible applications remarkable devices diverse geometrical resonant properties
