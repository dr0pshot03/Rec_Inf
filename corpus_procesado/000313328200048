jnk expression macrophages promotes obesity-induced insulin resistance inflammation
cjun nh2-terminal kinase jnk signaling pathway contributes inflammation plays key role metabolic response obesity including insulin resistance macrophages implicated process test role jnk established mice selective jnk deficiency macrophages report feeding high-fat diet control jnk-deficient mice caused similar obesity mice jnk-deficient macrophages remained insulin-sensitive protection mice macrophage-specific jnk deficiency insulin resistance associated reduced tissue infiltration macrophages immunophenotyping demonstrated jnk required pro-inflammatory macrophage polarization studies demonstrate jnk macrophages required establishment obesity-induced insulin resistance inflammation
