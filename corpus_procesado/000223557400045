intracellular acidosis enhances excitability working muscle
intracellular acidification skeletal muscles commonly thought contribute muscle fatigue however intracellular acidosis also acts preserve muscle excitability muscles become depolarized occurs working muscles show process may mediated decreased chloride permeability enables action potentials still propagated along internal network tubules muscle fiber t system despite muscle depolarization results implicate chloride ion channels muscle function emphasize intracellular acidosis muscle protective effects muscle fatigue
