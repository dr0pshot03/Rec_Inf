sperm chromatin proteomics identifies evolutionarily conserved fertility factors 
male infertility long-standing enigma significant medical concern integrity sperm chromatin clinical indicator male fertility vitro fertilization potential1: chromosome aneuploidy dna decondensation damage correlated reproductive failure identifying conserved proteins important sperm chromatin structure packaging can reveal universal causes infertility combine proteomics cytology functional analysis caenorhabditis elegans identify spermatogenic chromatin-associated proteins important fertility strategy employed multiple steps: purification chromatin comparable meiotic cell types namely undergoing spermatogenesis oogenesis; proteomic analysis multidimensional protein identification technology mudpit factors co-purify chromatin; prioritization sperm proteins based abundance; subtraction common proteins eliminate general chromatin meiotic factors approach reduced proteins co-purified spermatogenic chromatin currently extensive catalogue proteins functional analysis reduction gene function rna interference coupled protein localization studies revealed conserved spermatogenesis-specific proteins vital dna compaction chromosome segregation fertility unexpected roles spermatogenesis also detected factors involved processes strategy find fertility factors conserved c elegans mammals achieved goal: mouse gene knockouts corresponding nematode proteins % / cause male sterility list therefore provides significant opportunity identify causes male infertility targets male contraceptives
