semaphorin 7a initiates t-cell-mediated inflammatory responses alpha beta integrin 
semaphorins axon guidance factors assist growing axons finding appropriate targets forming synapses1 emerging evidence suggests semaphorins involved embryonic development also immune responses2 semaphorin 7a sema7a; also known cd10834 glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored semaphorin promotes axon outgrowth beta -integrin receptors contributes formation lateral olfactory tract5 although sema7a shown stimulate human monocytes6 function negative regulator t-cell responses also reported7 thus precise function sema7a immune system remains unclear show sema7a expressed activated t cells stimulates cytokine production monocytes macrophages alpha beta integrin also known late antigen- component immunological synapse critical effector phase inflammatory immune response sema7a-deficient sema7a-/- mice defective cell-mediated immune responses contact hypersensitivity experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis although antigen-specific cytokine-producing effector t cells can develop migrate antigen-challenged sites sema7a-/- mice sema7a-/- t cells fail induce contact hypersensitivity even directly injected antigen-challenged sites thus interaction sema7a alpha beta integrin crucial site inflammation findings identify function sema7a effector molecule t-cell-mediated inflammation also reveal mechanism integrin-mediated immune regulation
