mesoscale iron enrichment experiments : synthesis future directions
since mid-1980s understanding nutrient limitation oceanic primary production radically changed mesoscale iron addition experiments feaxs unequivocally shown iron supply limits production one-third world ocean surface macronutrient concentrations perennially high findings feaxs also reveal iron supply exerts controls dynamics plankton blooms turn affect biogeochemical cycles carbon nitrogen silicon sulfur ultimately influence earth climate system however extrapolation key results feaxs regional seasonal scales cases limited differing modes iron supply feaxs modern paleo-oceans new research directions include quantification coupling oceanic iron carbon biogeochemistry
