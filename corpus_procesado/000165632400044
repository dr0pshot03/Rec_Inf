down-regulation macrophage lineage interaction ox2 cd200 
ox2 cd200 broadly expressed membrane glycoprotein shown important regulation macrophage lineage mice lacking cd200 macrophage lineage cells including brain microglia exhibited activated phenotype numerous upon facial nerve transection damaged cd200-deficient neurons elicited accelerated microglial response lack cd200 resulted rapid onset experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis eae outside brain disruption cd200-cd200 receptor interaction precipitated susceptibility collagen-induced arthritiscia mice normally resistant disease thus diverse tissues ox2 delivers inhibitory signal macrophage lineage
