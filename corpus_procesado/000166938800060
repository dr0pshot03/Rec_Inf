map human genome sequence variation containing million single nucleotide polymorphisms
describe map million single nucleotide polymorphisms snps distributed throughout human genome providing average density available sequence one snp every kilobases snps primarily discovered two projects: snp consortium analysis clone overlaps international human genome sequencing consortium map integrates publicly available snps described genes genomic features estimate snps fall within exon coding untranslated regions % exons within kb nearest snp nucleotide diversity varies greatly across genome manner broadly consistent standard population genetic model human history high-density snp map provides public resource defining haplotype variation across genome help identify biomedically important genes diagnosis therapy
