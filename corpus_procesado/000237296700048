voltage sensor-domain protein voltage-gated proton channel 
voltage-gated proton channels widely observed identified molecular level report four-transmembrane protein similar voltage-sensor domain voltage-gated ion channels voltage-gated proton channel cells overexpressing protein showed depolarization-induced outward currents accompanied tail currents current reversal occured equilibrium potentials protons currents exhibited ph-dependent gating zinc ion sensitivity two features characteristic voltage-gated proton channels responses voltage dependence sequence changes suggest mouse voltage-sensor domain-only protein channel rather regulator another channel protein
