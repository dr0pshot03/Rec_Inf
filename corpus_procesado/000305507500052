electrical wind force-driven dislocation-templated amorphization phase-change nanowires
phase-change materials undergo rapid reversible crystalline-to-amorphous structural transformation used nonvolatile memory devices however transformation mechanism remains poorly understood studied effect electrical pulses crystalline-to-amorphous phase change single-crystalline ge2sb2te5 gst nanowire memory device situ transmission electron microscopy show electrical pulses produce dislocations crystalline gst become mobile glide direction hole-carrier motion continuous increase density dislocations moving unidirectionally material leads dislocation jamming eventually induces crystalline-to-amorphous phase change sharp interface spanning entire nanowire cross section dislocation-templated amorphization explains large on/off resistance ratio device
