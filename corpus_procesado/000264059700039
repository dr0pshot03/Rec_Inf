direct observation pressure-induced metal-to-semiconductor transition lithium
lithium lightest metal long considered simple electronic structure can well explained within nearly-free-electron model lithium stay simple compression: rather becoming free-electron-like pressure increased first-principles calculations suggest transforms semi-metal semiconductor experimentally shown dense lithium adopts low-symmetry structures also evidence resistivity increases pressure- however electronic transport properties lithium far directly monitored function increasing static pressure report electrical resistance measurements lithium diamond anvil cell pressures gpa reveal significant increase electrical resistivity change temperature dependence near gpa data thus provide unambiguous experimental evidence pressure-induced metal-to-semiconductor transition simple metallic element
