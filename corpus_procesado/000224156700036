supernova origin dust high-redshift quasar 
interstellar dust plays crucial role evolution universe assisting formation molecules triggering formation first low-mass stars absorbing stellar ultraviolet optical light subsequently re-emitting infrared/millimetre wavelengths dust thought produced predominantly envelopes evolved age > gyr low-mass stars picture however recently brought question discovery large masses dust host galaxies quasars redshift z > age universe less gyr theoretical studies- corroborated observations nearby supernova remnants- suggested supernovae provide fast efficient dust formation environment early universe report infrared observations quasar redshift used obtain directly dust extinction curve show curve excellent agreement supernova dust models result demonstrates supernova origin dust high-redshift quasar infer dust high redshifts probably origin
