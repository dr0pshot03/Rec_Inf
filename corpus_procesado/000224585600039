ultra-remote stereocontrol conformational communication information along carbon chain 
many receptors allosteric proteins function binding molecule induce conformational change influences remote active site synthetic systems comparable intramolecular information transfer can effected using shape one part molecule control stereoselectivity reactions occurring distance away however need direct communication reaction site usually limits remote stereocontrol distances five bond lengths cyclic structures overcome problem allowing controlling centre reaction site approach information transfer spans short absolute distances truly remote stereocontrol can however achieved rigid compounds containing amide groups: conformation amides can controlled stereogenic centres- responds neighbouring amide groups- turn influences stereoselective reactions strategy allowed remote stereocontrol spanning ref ref bonds demonstrate stereocontrol reaction taking place bond lengths controlling centre corresponding linear distance nm transmission information achieved conformational changes relayed molecule provides chemical model allostery might serve molecular mechanism communicating processing information-
