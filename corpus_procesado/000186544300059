genetic screen drosophila metastatic behavior
genetic screen designed drosophila interrogate genome mutations sufficient cause noninvasive tumors eye disc invade neighboring distant tissues found cooperation oncogenic rasv12 expression inactivation one number genes affecting cell polarity leads metastatic behavior including basement membrane degradation loss e-cadherin expression migration invasion secondary tumor formation inactivation cell polarity genes drive metastatic behavior alone combination tumor-initiating alterations findings suggest oncogenic background tissues makes distinct contribution toward metastatic development
