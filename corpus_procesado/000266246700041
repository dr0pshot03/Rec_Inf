abscisic acid inhibits type 2c protein phosphatases via pyr/pyl family start proteins
type 2c protein phosphatases pp2cs vitally involved abscisic acid aba signaling show synthetic growth inhibitor called pyrabactin functions selective aba agonist pyrabactin acts pyrabactin resistance pyr1 founding member family start proteins called pyr/pyls necessary pyrabactin aba signaling vivo show aba binds pyr1 turn binds inhibits pp2cs conclude pyr/pyls aba receptors functioning apex negative regulatory pathway controls aba signaling inhibiting pp2cs results illustrate power chemical genetic approach sidestepping genetic redundancy
