local nanomechanical motion cell wall saccharomyces cerevisiae
demonstrate cell wall living saccharomyces cerevisiae bakers yeast exhibits local temperature-dependent nanomechanical motion characteristic frequencies periodic motions range khz amplitudes similar to3 nm measured using cantilever atomic force microscope afm exposure cells metabolic inhibitor causes periodic motion cease strong frequency dependence temperature derive activation energy kj/mol consistent cells metabolism involving molecular motors kinesin dynein myosin magnitude forces observed similar to10 nn suggests concerted nanomechanical activity operative cell
