divided representation concurrent goals human frontal lobes 
anterior prefrontal cortex apc confers humans ability simultaneously pursue several goals brains motivational system including medial frontal cortex mfc drive pursuit concurrent goals using brain imaging observed left right mfc jointly drive single-task performance according expected rewards divide dual-task conditions: left mfc encodes rewards driving one task right mfc concurrently encodes driving task dichotomy observed lateral frontal cortex whereas apc combined rewards driving tasks two frontal lobes thus divide representing simultaneously two concurrent goals coordinated apc human frontal function seems limited driving pursuit two concurrent goals simultaneously
