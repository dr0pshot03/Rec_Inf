unexpected inhibition fusion nucleus-nucleus collisions
unstable heavy atomic nuclei found nature can created fusing two stable nuclei process analogous colliding charged droplets liquid recently formation handful super-heavy nuclei atomic numbers ref ref achieved fusion heavy nuclei electrostatic energy systems large reason super-heavy nuclei unstable although two nuclei may initially captured nuclear potential rather fusing almost always separate transfer mass lighter nucleus process called quasi-fission can inhibit fusion many orders magnitude understanding inhibition may hold key forming super-heavy elements theoretically inhibition predicted ref references therein product zz charges projectile target nuclei larger report measurements three fusion reactions zz around half value forming ra- find convincing model-independent evidence inhibition fusion presence quasi-fission results defy interpretation within standard picture nuclear fusion fission
