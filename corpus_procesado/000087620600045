significant dissipation tidal energy deep ocean inferred satellite altimeter data 
ocean tides dissipate energy longstanding questions consequences ranging history moon mixing oceans historically principal sink tidal energy thought bottom friction shallow seas long suggestive evidence however tidal dissipation also occurs open ocean scattering ocean-bottom topography surface tides internal waves estimates magnitude possible sink varied widely- use satellite altimeter data topex/poseidon map empirically tidal energy dissipation show approximately watts-that tw representing % total dissipation-occurs deep ocean generally near areas rough topography estimated tw mixing energy required maintain large-scale thermohaline circulation ocean one-half therefore provided tides half coming action surface ocean
