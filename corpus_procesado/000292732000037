explosive percolation continuous
explosive percolation said occur evolving network macroscopic connected component emerges number steps much smaller system size recent predictions based simulations suggested certain achlioptas processes much-studied local modifications classical mean-field growth model erdos renyi exhibit phenomenon undergoing phase transition discontinuous scaling limit show fact achlioptas processes continuous phase transitions although related models number nodes sampled may grow network size can indeed exhibit explosive percolation
