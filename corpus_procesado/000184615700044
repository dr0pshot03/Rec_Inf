phylogenetics cohesion bacterial genomes
gene acquisition ongoing process many bacterial genomes contributing adaptation ecological diversification lateral gene transfer considered primary explanation discordance among gene phylogenies obstacle reconstructing tree life measured extent phylogenetic conflict alien-gene acquisition within quartets sequenced genomes although comparisons complete gene inventories indicate appreciable gain loss genes orthologs available phylogenetic reconstruction consistent single tree
