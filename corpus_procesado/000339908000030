tunable spin-spin interactions entanglement ions separate potential wells
quantum simulation-the use one quantum system simulate less controllable one-may provide understanding many quantum systems modelled using classical computers considerable progress control manipulation achieved various quantum systems- one remaining challenges implementation scalable devices regard individual ions trapped separate tunable potential wells promising- implement basic features approach demonstrate deterministic tuning coulomb interaction two ions independently controlling local wells scheme suitable emulating range spin-spin interactions characterize performance set-up select one entangles internal states two ions fidelity digit inparentheses shows standard error mean extension building block two-dimensional network possible using ion-trap microfabrication processes may provide new quantum simulator architecture broad flexibility designing scaling arrangement ions mutual interactions perform useful quantum simulations including condensed-matter phenomena fractional quantum hall effect array tens ions might sufficient
