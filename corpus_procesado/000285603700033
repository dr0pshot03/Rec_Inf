high-flux solar-driven thermochemical dissociation co2 h2o using nonstoichiometric ceria 
solar energy available large excess relative current rates energy consumption effective conversion renewable yet intermittent resource transportable dispatchable chemical fuel may ensure goal sustainable energy future however low conversion efficiencies particularly co2 reduction well utilization precious materials limited practical generation solar fuels using solar cavity-receiver reactor combined oxygen uptake release capacity cerium oxide facile catalysis elevated temperatures thermochemically dissociate co2 h2o yielding co h- respectively stable rapid generation fuel demonstrated cycles solar-to-fuel efficiencies % achieved shown largely limited system scale design rather chemistry
