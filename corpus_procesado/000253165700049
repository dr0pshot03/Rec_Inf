metal chelation inhibition bacterial growth tissue abscesses 
bacterial infection often results formation tissue abscesses represent primary site interaction invading bacteria innate immune system identify host protein calprotectin neutrophil dependent factor expressed inside staphylococcus aureus abscesses neutrophil derived calprotectin inhibited s aureus growth chelation nutrient mn2+ zn2+: activity results reprogramming bacterial transcriptome abscesses mice lacking calprotectin enriched metal staphylococcal proliferation enhanced metal rich abscesses results demonstrate calprotectin critical factor innate immune response infection define metal chelation strategy inhibiting microbial growth inside abscessed tissue
