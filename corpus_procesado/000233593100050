risk severe asthma episodes predicted fluctuation analysis airway function 
asthma increasing health problem worldwide long-term temporal pattern clinical symptoms understood predicting asthma episodes generally possible analyse time series peak expiratory flows standard measurement airway function assessed twice daily large asthmatic population long term crossover clinical trial introduce approach predict risk worsening airflow obstruction calculating conditional probability given current airway condition severe obstruction will occur within days find compared placebo regular long acting bronchodilator salmeterol widely used improve asthma control decreases risk airway obstruction unexpectedly however regular short acting beta-agonist bronchodilator albuterol increases risk furthermore find time series peak expiratory flows show long range correlations change significantly disease severity approaching random process increased variability severe cases using nonlinear stochastic model show increased variability loss correlations augment risk unstable airway function characterization fluctuations airway function provides quantitative basis objective risk prediction asthma episodes evaluating effectiveness therapy
