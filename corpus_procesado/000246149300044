direct measurement antiferromagnetic domain fluctuations
measurements magnetic noise emanating ferromagnets owing domain motion first carried nearly years ago underpinned much science technology antiferromagnets carry net external magnetic dipole moment yet periodic arrangement electron spins extending macroscopic distances also display magnetic noise however must sampled spatial wavelengths order several interatomic spacings rather macroscopic scales characteristic ferromagnets present direct measurement fluctuations nanometre-scale superstructure spin charge-density waves associated antiferromagnetism elemental chromium technique used x-ray photon correlation spectroscopy coherent x-ray diffraction produces speckle pattern serves fingerprint particular magnetic domain configuration temporal evolution patterns corresponds domain walls advancing retreating micrometre distances work demonstrates useful measurement tool antiferromagnetic domain wall engineering also reveals fundamental finding spin dynamics simplest antiferromagnet: although domain wall motion thermally activated temperatures k lower temperatures indeed rate saturates finite value consistent quantum fluctuations cooling k
