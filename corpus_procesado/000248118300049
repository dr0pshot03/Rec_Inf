generation germline-competent induced pluripotent stem cells
previously shown pluripotent stem cells can induced mouse fibroblasts retroviral introduction oct3/ also called pou5f1 sox2 c-myc klf4 subsequent selection fbx15 also called fbxo15 expression induced pluripotent stem ips cells hereafter called fbx15 ips cells similar embryonic stem es cells morphology proliferation teratoma formation however different regards gene expression dna methylation patterns fail produce adult chimaeras show selection nanog expression results germline-competent ips cells increased es-cell-like gene expression dna methylation patterns compared fbx15 ips cells four transgenes oct3/ sox2 c-myc klf4 strongly silenced nanog ips cells obtained adult chimaeras seven nanog ips cell clones one clone transmitted germ line next generation approximately % offspring developed tumours attributable reactivation c-myc transgene thus ips cells competent germline chimaeras can obtained fibroblasts retroviral introduction c-myc avoided clinical application
