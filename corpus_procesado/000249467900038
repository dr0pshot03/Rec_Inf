current-induced magnetization switching spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscope
switching magnetization magnetic bit injection spin-polarized current offers possibility development innovative high-density data storage technologies show individual superparamagnetic iron nanoislands typical sizes atoms can addressed locally switched using magnetic scanning probe tip thus demonstrating current-induced magnetization reversal across vacuum barrier combined ultimate resolution spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy technique allows us separate quantify three fundamental contributions involved magnetization switching ie current-induced spin torque heating island tunneling current oersted field effects thereby providing improved understanding switching mechanism
