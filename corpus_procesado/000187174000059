inferring nonneutral evolution human-chimp-mouse orthologous gene trios 
even though human chimpanzee gene sequences nearly % identical sequence comparisons can nevertheless highly informative identifying biologically important changes occurred since ancestral lineages diverged analyzed alignments chimpanzee gene sequences human mouse orthologs three-species sequence alignments allowed us identify genes undergoing natural selection along human chimp lineage fitting models include parameters specifying rates synonymous nonsynonymous nucleotide substitution evolutionary approach revealed informative set genes significantly different patterns substitution human lineage compared chimpanzee mouse lineages partitions genes inferred biological classes identified accelerated evolution several functional classes including olfaction nuclear transport addition suggesting adaptive physiological differences chimps humans human-accelerated genes significantly likely underlie major known mendelian disorders
