noise correlations improve response fidelity stimulus encoding
computation nervous system often relies integration signals parallel circuits different functional properties correlated noise inputs can principle diverse dramatic effects reliability resulting computations- theoretical predictions rarely tested experimentally scarcity preparations permit measurement covariation neurons input signals effect cells output manipulating covariation introduce method measure covariation excitatory inhibitory inputs cell receives method revealed strong correlated noise inputs two types retinal ganglion cell eliminating correlated noise without changing input properties substantially decreased accuracy cells spike outputs encoded light inputs thus covariation excitatory inhibitory inputs can critical determinant reliability neural coding computation
