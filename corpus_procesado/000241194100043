mutant chaperone converts wild-type protein tumor-specific antigen 
monoclonal antibodies become important therapeutic agents certain cancers many tumor-specific antigens mutant proteins predominantly intracellular thus readily accessible monoclonal antibodies found wild-type transmembrane protein transformed tumor-specific antigen somatic mutation chaperone gene cosmc abolished function glycosyltransferase disrupting o-glycan core synthesis creating tumor-specific glycopeptidic neo-epitope consisting monosaccharide specific wild-type protein sequence epitope induced high-affinity highly specific syngeneic monoclonal antibody antitumor activity tumor-specific glycopeptidic neo-epitopes represent potential targets monoclonal antibody therapy
