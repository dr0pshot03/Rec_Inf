volcanic-plutonic parity differentiation continental crust 
continental crust central biological geological history earth however crustal heterogeneity prevented thorough geochemical comparison primary igneous building blocks-volcanic plutonic rocks-and processes differentiate felsic compositions analysis comprehensive global data set volcanic plutonic whole-rock geochemistry shows differentiation trends primitive basaltic felsic compositions volcanic versus plutonic samples generally indistinguishable subduction-zone settings divergent continental rifts offsets major trace-element differentiation patterns rift settings suggest higher water content plutonic magmas reduced eruptibility hydrous silicate magmas relative dry rift volcanics tectonic settings results indicate fractional crystallization rather crustal melting predominantly responsible production intermediate felsic magmas emphasizing role mafic cumulates residue crustal differentiation
