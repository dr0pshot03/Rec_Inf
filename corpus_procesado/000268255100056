gene network regulating lysosomal biogenesis function
lysosomes organelles central degradation recycling processes animal cells whether lysosomal activity coordinated respond cellular needs remains unclear found lysosomal genes exhibit coordinated transcriptional behavior regulated transcription factor eb tfeb aberrant lysosomal storage conditions tfeb translocated cytoplasm nucleus resulting activation target genes tfeb overexpression cultured cells induced lysosomal biogenesis increased degradation complex molecules glycosaminoglycans pathogenic protein causes huntingtons disease thus genetic program controls lysosomal biogenesis function providing potential therapeutic target enhance cellular clearing lysosomal storage disorders neurodegenerative diseases
