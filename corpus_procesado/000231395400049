drosophila rnai screen reveals cd36 family member required mycobacterial infection 
certain pathogens mycobacterium tuberculosis survive within hostile intracellular environment macrophage identify host factors required mycobacterial entry survival within macrophages performed genome-wide rna interference screen drosophila macrophage-like cells using mycobacterium fortuitum identified factors required general phagocytosis well needed specifically mycobacterial infection one specific factor peste pes cd36 family member required uptake mycobacteria escherichia coli staphylococcus aureus moreover mammalian class b scavenger receptors srs conferred uptake bacteria nonphagocytic cells sr-bi sr-bii uniquely mediating uptake m fortuitum suggests conserved role class b srs pattern recognition innate immunity
