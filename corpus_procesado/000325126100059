fungal small rnas suppress plant immunity hijacking host rna interference pathways 
botrytis cinerea causative agent gray mold disease aggressive fungal pathogen infects plant species show b cinerea small rnas bc-srnas can silence arabidopsis tomato genes involved immunity bc-srnas hijack host rna interference rnai machinery binding arabidopsis argonaute ago1 selectively silencing host immunity genes arabidopsis ago1 mutant exhibits reduced susceptibility b cinerea b cinerea dcl1 dcl2 double mutant can longer produce bc-srnas displays reduced pathogenicity arabidopsis tomato thus fungal pathogen transfers "virulent" srna effectors host plant cells suppress host immunity achieve infection demonstrates naturally occurring cross-kingdom rnai advanced virulence mechanism
