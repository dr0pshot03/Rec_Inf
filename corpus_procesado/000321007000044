transcription torsion 
cells rna polymerase rnap must transcribe supercoiled dna whose torsional state constantly changing rnap deals dna supercoiling remains elusive report direct measurements individual escherichia coli rnaps transcribed supercoiled dna found resisting torque slowed rnap increased pause frequency duration rnap able generate +/ piconewton-nanometers mean +/ standard deviation torque stalling amount sufficient melt dna arbitrary sequence establish rnap potent torsional motor previously known stalled rnap able resume transcription upon torque relaxation transcribing rnap resilient transient torque fluctuations results provide quantitative framework understanding dynamic modification dna supercoiling regulates transcription
