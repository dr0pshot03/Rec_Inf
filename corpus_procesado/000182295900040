common structure soluble amyloid oligomers implies common mechanism pathogenesis 
soluble oligomers common amyloids may represent primary toxic species amyloids like abeta peptide alzheimers disease ad show soluble oligomers tested display common conformation-dependent structure unique soluble oligomers regardless sequence vitro toxicity soluble oligomers inhibited oligomer-specific antibody soluble oligomers unique distribution human ad brain distinct fibrillar amyloid results indicate different types soluble amyloid oligomers common structure suggest share common mechanism toxicity
