unlocking molecular secrets sodium-coupled transporters 
transmembrane sodium-ion gradients provide energy can harnessed secondary transporters drive translocation solute molecules cell decades study shown sodium-coupled transporters involved many physiological processes making targets treatment numerous diseases within past year crystal structures several sodium-coupled transporters different families reported showing remarkable structural conservation functionally unrelated transporters atomic-resolution structures revealing mechanism sodium-coupled transport solutes across cellular membranes
