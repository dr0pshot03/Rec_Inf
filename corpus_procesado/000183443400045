pathogen-induced systemic plant signal triggers dna rearrangements 
plant genome stability known affected various abiotic environmental conditions- little known effect pathogens example exposure maize plants barley stripe mosaic virus seems activate transposable elements cause mutations non-infected progeny infected plants induction barley stripe mosaic virus inherited effect may mean virus non-cell-autonomous influence genome stability infection peronospora parasitica results increase frequency somatic recombination arabidopsis thaliana however unclear whether effects recombination require presence pathogen represent systemic plant response also clear whether changes frequency somatic recombination can inherited report threefold increase homologous recombination frequency infected noninfected tissue tobacco plants infected either tobacco mosaic virus oilseed rape mosaic virus results indicate existence systemic recombination signal also results increased frequency meiotic and/or inherited late somatic recombination
