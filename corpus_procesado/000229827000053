photoinduced plasticity cross-linked polymers 
chemically cross-linked polymers inherently limited stresses introduced post-gelation volume changes polymerization also difficult change cross-linked polymers shape without corresponding loss material properties substantial stress development demonstrate cross-linked polymer upon exposure light exhibits stress and/or strain relaxation without concomitant change material properties result achieved introducing radicals via photocleavage residual photoinitiator polymer matrix diffuse via addition-fragmentation chain transfer midchain functional groups processes lead photoinduced plasticity actuation equilibrium shape changes without residual stress polymeric materials critical development microdevices biomaterials polymeric coatings
