disorder-free non-bcs superconductor cs3c60 emerges antiferromagnetic insulator parent state 
body-centered cubic a15-structured cesium fulleride cs3c60 superconducting ambient pressure free disorder unlike well-studied face-centered cubic ac alkali metal fulleride superconductors found cs3c60 molecular valences precisely assigned superconducting state kelvin emerges directly localized electron antiferromagnetic insulating state application pressure transition maintains threefold degeneracy active orbitals competing electronic states thus purely electronic transition superconducting state dependence transition temperature pressure-induced changes anion packing density explicable bardeen-cooper-schrieffer bcs theory
