spectrum extrasolar planet 
known extrasolar planets exhibit transits front parent stars seen earth spectroscopic observations transiting planets can probe physical conditions atmospheres one technique can used derive planetary spectrum subtracting stellar spectrum measured eclipse planet hidden behind star combined-light spectrum measured outside eclipse star+planet although several attempts made earth-based observatories spectrum yet measured established extrasolar planets report measurement infrared spectrum mu m transiting extrasolar planet hd 209458b observations reveal hot thermal continuum planetary spectrum approximately constant ratio stellar flux wavelength range superposed continuum broad emission peak centred near mu m attribute emission silicate clouds also find narrow unidentified emission feature mu m models hot jupiter planets predict flux peak- near mu m thermal emission deep atmosphere emerges relatively unimpeded water absorption models dominated water fit observed spectrum poorly
