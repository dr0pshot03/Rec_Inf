core motor domain determines direction myosin movement
myosins constitute superfamily least known classes molecular motors move along actin filaments- myosins move towards plus end f-actin filaments however shown recently certain class myosin class vi myosin moves towards opposite end f-actin minus direction large unique insertion myosin vi head domain motor domain light-chain-binding domain lever arm thought insertion alters angle lever-arm switch movement thereby changing direction motility determine direction motility chimaeric myosins comprise motor domain lever-arm domain containing insert myosins movement opposite direction results show motor core domain neither large insert converter domain determines direction myosin motility
