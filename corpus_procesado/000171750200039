energy spectra quantum rings
quantum mechanical experiments ring geometries long fascinated physicists open rings connected leads example allow observation aharonov-bohm effect one best examples quantum mechanical phase coherence phase coherence electrons travelling quantum dot embedded one arm open ring also demonstrated energy spectra closed rings recently studied optical spectroscopy prediction allow persistent current explored various experiments- report magnetotransport experiments closed rings coulomb blockade regime experiments show microscopic understanding energy levels far limited few-electron quantum dots can extended many-electron system semiclassical interpretation results indicates electron motion rings governed regular rather chaotic motion unexplored regime many-electron quantum dots opens way experiments even complex structures can investigated quantum mechanical level
