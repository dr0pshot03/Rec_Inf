dna unwinding heterogeneity recbcd results static molecules able equilibrate 
single-molecule studies can overcome complications asynchrony ensemble-averaging bulk-phase measurements provide mechanistic insights molecular activities reveal interesting variations individual molecules- application techniques recbcd helicase escherichia coli resolved long-standing discrepancies provided otherwise unattainable mechanistic insights enzymatic behaviour- enigmatically dna unwinding rates individual enzyme molecules seen vary considerably- origin heterogeneity remains unknown investigate physical basis behaviour although individual recbcd molecule unwound dna constant rate average approximately steps discover transiently halting single enzyme-dna complex depleting mg2+-atp change subsequent rates dna unwinding enzyme reintroduction ligand proportion molecules changed rate increased exponentially duration interruption half-life approximately second suggesting conformational change occurred time molecule arrested velocity pausing individual molecule velocity found starting distribution ensemble suggest substrate binding stabilizes enzyme one many equilibrium conformational sub-states determine rate-limiting translocation behaviour recbcd molecule stabilized sub-state can persist duration approximately minute processive unwinding dna molecule comprising tens thousands catalytic steps much faster time needed conformational change required alter kinetic behaviour ligand-dependent stabilization rate-defining conformational sub-states results seemingly static molecule-to-molecule variation recbcd helicase activity fact reflects one microstate equilibrium ensemble single molecule manifests individual processive translocation event
