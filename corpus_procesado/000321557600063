mutational heterogeneity cancer search new cancer-associated genes 
major international projects underway aimed creating comprehensive catalogue genes responsible initiation progression cancer- studies involve sequencing matched tumour-normal samples followed mathematical analysis identify genes mutations occur frequently expected random chance describe fundamental problem cancer genome studies: sample size increases list putatively significant genes produced current analytical methods burgeons hundreds list includes many implausible genes encoding olfactory receptors muscle protein titin suggesting extensive false-positive findings overshadow true driver events show problem stems largely mutational heterogeneity provide novel analytical methodology mutsigcv resolving problem apply mutsigcv exome sequences tumour-normal pairs discover extraordinary variation mutation frequency spectrum within cancer types sheds light mutational processes disease aetiology mutation frequency across genome strongly correlated dna replication timing also transcriptional activity incorporating mutational heterogeneity analyses mutsigcv able eliminate apparent artefactual findings enable identification genes truly associated cancer
