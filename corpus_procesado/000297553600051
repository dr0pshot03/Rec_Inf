inhibition pyruvate kinase m2 reactive oxygen species contributes cellular antioxidant responses 
control intracellular reactive oxygen species ros concentrations critical cancer cell survival show human lung cancer cells acute increases intracellular concentrations ros caused inhibition glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase m2 pkm2 oxidation cys inhibition pkm2 required divert glucose flux pentose phosphate pathway thereby generate sufficient reducing potential detoxification ros lung cancer cells endogenous pkm2 replaced cys ser oxidation-resistant mutant exhibited increased sensitivity oxidative stress impaired tumor formation xenograft model besides promoting metabolic changes required proliferation regulatory properties pkm2 may confer additional advantage cancer cells allowing withstand oxidative stress
