engineering carbon nanotubes nanotube circuits using electrical breakdown 
carbon nanotubes display either metallic semiconducting properties large multiwalled nanotubes mwnts many concentric carbon shells bundles ropes aligned single-walled nanotubes swnts complex composite conductors incorporate many weakly coupled nanotubes different electronic structure demonstrate simple reliable method selectively removing single carbon shells mwnts swnt ropes tailor properties composite nanotubes can remove shells mwnts stepwise individually characterize different shells choosing among shells can convert mwnt either metallic semiconducting conductor well directly address issue multiple-shell transport swnt ropes similar selectivity allows us generate entire arrays nanoscale field-effect transistors based solely fraction semiconducting swnts
