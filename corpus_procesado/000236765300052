conservation ret regulatory function human zebrafish without sequence similarity 
evolutionary sequence conservation accepted criterion identify noncoding regulatory sequences used transposon-based transgenic assay zebrafish evaluate noncoding sequences zebrafish ret locus conserved among teleosts human ret locus conserved among mammals teleost sequences directed ret-specific reporter gene expression many displaying overlapping regulatory control majority human ret noncoding sequences also directed ret-specific expression zebrafish thus vast amounts functional sequence information may exist detected sequence similarity approaches
