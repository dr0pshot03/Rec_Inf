probing molecular dynamics attosecond resolution using correlated wave packet pairs 
spectroscopic measurements increasingly higher time resolution generally thought require increasingly shorter laser pulses illustrated recent monitoring decay core-excited krypton1 using attosecond photon pulses23 however alternative approach probing ultrafast dynamic processes might provided entanglement improved precision45 quantum optical measurements use approach observe motion d2+ vibrational wave packet formed multiphoton ionization d2 several femtoseconds precision attoseconds angstroms exploiting correlation electronic nuclear wave packets formed ionization event intense infrared laser field drives electron wave packet electron recollision6- probes nuclear motion results show laser pulse duration need limit time resolution spectroscopic measurement provided process studied involves formation correlated wave packets one can controlled; spatial resolution likewise limited focal spot size laser wavelength
