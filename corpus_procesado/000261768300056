nuclear receptor corepressor histone deacetylase govern circadian metabolic physiology 
rhythmic changes histone acetylation circadian clock genes suggest temporal modulation gene expression regulated chromatin modifications1- furthermore recent studies demonstrate critical relationship circadian metabolic physiology4- nuclear receptor corepressor ncor1 functions activating subunit chromatin modifying enzyme histone deacetylase hdac38 lack ncor1 incompatible life hence unknown whether ncor1 particularly regulation hdac3 critical adult mammalian physiology9 show specific genetic disruption ncor1-hdac3 interaction mice causes aberrant regulation clock genes results abnormal circadian behaviour mice also leaner insulin sensitive owing increased energy expenditure unexpectedly loss functional ncor1-hdac3 complex vivo lead sustained increases known catabolic genes instead significantly alters oscillatory patterns several metabolic genes demonstrating circadian regulation metabolism critical normal energy balance findings indicate activation hdac3 ncor1 nodal point epigenetic regulation circadian metabolic physiology
