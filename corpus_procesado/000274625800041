regulation cellular metabolism protein lysine acetylation
protein lysine acetylation emerged key posttranslational modification cellular regulation particular modification histones nuclear transcription regulators show lysine acetylation prevalent modification enzymes catalyze intermediate metabolism virtually every enzyme glycolysis gluconeogenesis tricarboxylic acid tca cycle urea cycle fatty acid metabolism glycogen metabolism found acetylated human liver tissue concentration metabolic fuels glucose amino acids fatty acids influenced acetylation status metabolic enzymes acetylation activated enoyl-coenzyme hydratase/-hydroxyacyl-coenzyme dehydrogenase fatty acid oxidation malate dehydrogenase tca cycle inhibited argininosuccinate lyase urea cycle destabilized phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase gluconeogenesis study reveals acetylation plays major role metabolic regulation
