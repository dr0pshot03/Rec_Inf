kimberlite ascent assimilation-fuelled buoyancy
kimberlite magmas deepest origin terrestrial magmas exclusively associated cratons- ascent travel kilometres cratonic mantle lithosphere entrain seemingly prohibitive loads per cent volume mantle-derived xenoliths xenocrysts including diamond kimberlite magmas also reputedly higher ascent rates- xenolith-bearing magmas exsolution dissolved volatiles carbon dioxide water thought essential provide sufficient buoyancy rapid ascent dense crystal-rich magmas cause nature exsolution however remains elusive rarely specified use series high-temperature experiments demonstrate mechanism spontaneous efficient continuous production volatile phase mechanism requires parental melts kimberlite originate carbonatite-like melts transit mantle lithosphere silica-undersaturated melts assimilate mantle minerals especially orthopyroxene driving melt silicic compositions causing marked drop carbon dioxide solubility solubility drop manifests immediately continuous vigorous exsolution fluid phase thereby reducing magma density increasing buoyancy driving rapid accelerating ascent increasingly kimberlitic magma model provides explanation continuous ascent magmas laden high volumes dense mantle cargo explanation chemical diversity kimberlite connection kimberlites cratons
