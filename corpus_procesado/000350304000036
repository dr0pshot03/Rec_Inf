state preservation repetitive error detection superconducting quantum circuit
quantum computing becomes viable quantum state can protected environment-induced error quantum bits qubits sufficiently reliable errors sparse quantum error correction qec- capable identifying correcting adding qubits improves preservation states guaranteeing increasingly larger clusters errors will cause logical failure key requirement large-scale systems using qec extend qubit lifetime remains one outstanding experimental challenges quantum computing report protection classical states environmental bit-flip errors demonstrate suppression errors increasing system size use linear array nine qubits natural step towards two-dimensional surface code qec scheme track errors occur repeatedly performing projective quantum non-demolition parity measurements relative single physical qubit reduce failure rate retrieving input state factor using five nine qubits factor using nine qubits eight cycles additionally tomographically verify preservation non-classical greenberger-horne-zeilinger state successful suppression environment-induced errors will motivate research many challenges associated building large-scale superconducting quantum computer
