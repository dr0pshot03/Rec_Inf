experimental evidence influence group size cultural complexity 
remarkable ecological demographic success humanity largely attributed capacity cumulative culture- accumulation beneficial cultural innovations across generations puzzling transmission events generally imperfect although large variance fidelity events perfect cultural transmission innovations frequent large population consequence large population size may prerequisite evolution cultural complexity although anthropological studies produced mixed results- empirical evidence lacking use dual-task computer game show cultural evolution strongly depends population size players larger groups maintained higher cultural complexity found group size increases cultural knowledge less deteriorated improvements existing cultural traits frequent cultural trait diversity maintained often results demonstrate changes group size can generate adaptive cultural evolution maladaptive losses culturally acquired skills humans live habitats ill-suited without specific cultural adaptations suggests evolutionary past group-size reduction may exposed human societies significant risks including societal collapse
