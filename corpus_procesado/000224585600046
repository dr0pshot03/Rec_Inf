neural correlates mental rehearsal dorsal premotor cortex 
behavioural imaging studies suggest humans mentally rehearse familiar action execute neural operations used overt motor performance- similarly neural activation present action observation many brain regions normally used performance including premotor cortex- present behavioural evidence monkeys also engage mental rehearsal observation sensory events associated well-learned motor task furthermore task-related neurons dorsal premotor cortex exhibit activity patterns observation performance even instructed-delay period actual observed motion activity might single-neuron correlate covert mental rehearsal
