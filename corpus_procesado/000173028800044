inter-receptor communication arrays bacterial chemoreceptors 
sensing mechanisms chemotactic bacteria allow respond sensitively stimuli escherichia coli example respond changes chemoattractant concentration less % range spanning six orders magnitude sensitivity range depends nonlinear relationship ligand concentration output response low ligand concentrations substantial amplification chemotactic signal required however mechanism responsible amplification remains unclear demonstrate inter-receptor communication within lattice acts amplify integrate sensory information synthetic multivalent ligands interact low-abundance galactose-sensing receptor trg stabilize large clusters chemoreceptors markedly enhance signal output enforced clusters treatment multivalent ligands response attractant serine amplified least fold amplification requires full complement chemoreceptors deletion aspartate tar dipeptide tap receptors diminishes amplification serine response results demonstrate entire array involved sensing mode information exchange general implications processing signals cellular receptors
