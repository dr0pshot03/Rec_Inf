south-polar features venus similar near north pole 
venus seasons slow rotation massive atmosphere mainly carbon dioxide clouds primarily sulphuric acid droplets infrared observations previous missions venus revealed bright dipole feature surrounded cold collar north pole- polar dipole double-eye feature centre vast vortex rotates around pole possibly associated rapid downwelling polar cold collar wide shallow river cold air circulates around polar vortex one outstanding question whether global circulation symmetric dipole feature existed south pole report observations venus south-polar region seen clouds morphology much like around north pole rotating somewhat faster northern dipole vortex may extend lower cloud layers lie km height perhaps deeper spectroscopic properties clouds around south pole compatible sulphuric acid composition
