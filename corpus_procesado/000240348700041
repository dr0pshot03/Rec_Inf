temporal spatial enumeration processes primate parietal cortex 
humans animals can nonverbally enumerate visual items across time sequence rapidly estimate set size spatial dot patterns single glance found temporal spatial enumeration processes engaged different populations neurons intraparietal sulcus behaving monkeys enumeration process completed however another neuronal population represented cardinality set irrespective whether cued spatial layout across time data suggest distinct neural processing stages different numerical formats also final convergence segregated information form abstract quantity representations
