reducing excessive gaba-mediated tonic inhibition promotes functional recovery stroke 
stroke leading cause disability pharmacological therapy currently available promoting recovery brain region adjacent stroke damage-the peri-infarct zone-is critical rehabilitation shows heightened neuroplasticity allowing sensorimotor functions re-map damaged areas1- thus understanding neuronal properties constraining plasticity important development new treatments show stroke mice tonic neuronal inhibition increased peri-infarct zone increased tonic inhibition mediated extrasynaptic gabaa receptors caused impairment gaba gamma-aminobutyric acid transporter gat-/gat- function counteract heightened inhibition administered vivo benzodiazepine inverse agonist specific alpha -subunit-containing extrasynaptic gabaa receptors delay stroke treatment produced early sustained recovery motor function genetically lowering number alpha delta-subunit-containing gabaa receptors responsible tonic inhibition also proved beneficial recovery stroke consistent therapeutic potential diminishing extrasynaptic gabaa receptor function together results identify new pharmacological targets provide rationale novel strategy promote recovery stroke possibly brain injuries
