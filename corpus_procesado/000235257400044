natural experimental evidence melt lubrication faults earthquakes
melt produced friction earthquakes may act either coseismic fault lubricant viscous brake estimate dynamic shear resistance tauf presence friction-induced melts exhumed faults high-velocity meters per second frictional experiments exhumed faults within granitoids tonalites indicate low tauf kilometers depth friction experiments tonalite samples show tauf depends weakly normal stress extrapolation experimental data yields tauf values consistent field estimates well byerlee strength conclude friction-induced melts can lubricate faults intermediate crustal depths
