cryptochromes mediate rhythmic repression glucocorticoid receptor 
mammalian metabolism highly circadian major hormonal circuits involving nuclear hormone receptors display interlinked diurnal cycling12 however mechanisms logically explain coordination nuclear hormone receptors clock poorly understood show two circadian co-regulators cryptochromes interact glucocorticoid receptor ligand-dependent fashion globally alter transcriptional response glucocorticoids mouse embryonic fibroblasts: cryptochrome deficiency vastly decreases gene repression approximately doubles number dexamethasone-induced genes suggesting cryptochromes broadly oppose glucocorticoid receptor activation promote repression mice genetic loss cryptochrome and/or results glucose intolerance constitutively high levels circulating corticosterone suggesting reduced suppression hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis coupled increased glucocorticoid transactivation liver genomically cryptochromes associate glucocorticoid response element phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase promoter hormone-dependent manner dexamethasone-induced transcription phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase gene strikingly increased cryptochrome-deficient livers results reveal specific mechanism cryptochromes couple activity clock receptor target genes complex genomic circuits underpinning normal metabolic homeostasis
