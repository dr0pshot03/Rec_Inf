mechanosensitive self-replication driven self-organization
self-replicating molecules likely played important role origin life small number fully synthetic self-replicators already described yet remains open question factors effectively bias replication toward far-from-equilibrium distributions characterizing even simple organisms report two self-replicating peptide-derived macrocycles emerge small dynamic combinatorial library compete common feedstock replication driven nanostructure formation resulting assembly peptides fibers held together beta sheets two replicators becomes dominant influenced whether sample shaken stirred results establish mechanical forces can act selection pressure competition replicators can determine outcome covalent synthesis
