superinsulator quantum synchronization 
synchronized oscillators ubiquitous nature synchronization plays key part various classical quantum phenomena several experiments- shown thin superconducting films disorder enforces droplet like electronic texture superconducting islands immersed normal matrix tuning disorder drives system superconducting insulating behaviour vicinity transition distinct state forms: cooper pair insulator thermally activated conductivity results synchronization phase superconducting order parameter islands across whole system show certain finite temperature cooper pair insulator undergoes transition superinsulating state infinite resistance present experimental evidence transition titanium nitride films show superinsulating state dual superconducting state: destroyed sufficiently strong critical magnetic field breaks critical voltage analogous critical current superconductors
