atp signaling crucial communication taste buds gustatory nerves 
taste receptor cells detect chemicals oral cavity transmit information taste nerves neurotransmitters identified report adenosine -triphosphate atp key neurotransmitter system genetic elimination ionotropic purinergic receptors p2x2 p2x3 eliminates taste responses taste nerves although nerves remain responsive touch temperature menthol similarly p2x-knockout mice show greatly reduced behavioral responses sweeteners glutamate bitter substances finally stimulation taste buds vitro evokes release atp thus atp fulfils criteria neurotransmitter linking taste buds nervous system
