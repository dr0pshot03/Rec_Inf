local long-range reciprocal regulation camp cgmp axon/dendrite formation
cytosolic cyclic adenosine monophosphate camp cyclic guanosine monophosphate cgmp often mediate antagonistic cellular actions extracellular factors regulation ion channels cell volume control axon guidance found localized camp cgmp activities undifferentiated neurites cultured hippocampal neurons promote suppress axon formation respectively exert opposite effects dendrite formation fluorescence resonance energy transfer imaging showed alterations amount camp resulted opposite changes amount cgmp vice versa activation specific phosphodiesterases protein kinases local elevation camp one neurite resulted camp reduction neurites neuron thus local long-range reciprocal regulation camp cgmp together ensures coordinated development one axon multiple dendrites
