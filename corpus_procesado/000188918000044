nanotubular highways intercellular organelle transport
cell-to-cell communication crucial prerequisite development maintenance multicellular organisms date diverse mechanisms intercellular exchange information documented including chemical synapses gap junctions plasmodesmata describe highly sensitive nanotubular structures formed de novo cells create complex networks structures facilitate selective transfer membrane vesicles organelles seem impede flow small molecules accordingly propose novel biological principle cell-to-cell interaction based membrane continuity intercellular transfer organelles
