evolution oligomeric state allosteric pathways mimic ligand binding 
introduction: evolution design protein complexes frequently viewed lens amino acid mutations protein interfaces showed previously residues distant interfaces also commonly involved evolution alternative quaternary structures hypothesized protein families difference oligomeric state due change intersubunit geometry indirect mutations act changing protein conformation dynamics similar way allosteric small molecules introduce functional conformational change refer substitutions allosteric mutations 
rationale: work investigate mechanism action allosteric mutations oligomeric state pyrr family pyrimidine operon attenuators family entirely sequence-conserved helix forms tetrameric interface thermophilic ortholog bcpyrr switches solvent-exposed mesophilic ortholog bspyrr results homodimeric structure two subunits clearly rotated relative orientation tetramer origin rotation change quaternary structure dissect role substitutions bspyrr bcpyrr used ancestral sequence reconstruction combination structural biophysical methods identify set allosteric mutations responsible shift conformation compared conformational changes introduced mutations protein motion allosteric regulation guanosine monophosphate gmp 
results: identified key mutations controlling oligomeric state distant interfaces outside ligand-binding pockets confirmed role allosteric mutations engineering shift oligomeric state inferred ancestral pyrr protein intermediate sequence extant orthologs used inferred ancestral states mutants show allosteric mutations part downhill adaptation pyrr proteins lower temperatures compared x-ray crystal structures ancestral engineered pyrr proteins free gmp-bound structure mesophilic bspyrr shifts equilibrium dimer tetramer upon ligand binding binding allosteric molecule introduces change intersubunit geometry equivalent evolutionary difference intersubunit geometry dimeric tetrameric homologs find difference oligomeric state coupled difference intrinsic dynamics dimers finally used residue-residue contact network approach show residues corresponding allosteric mutations undergo large contact rewiring intersubunit geometry turn oligomeric state change either gmp binding introduction allosteric mutations 
conclusion: show evolution employs intrinsic dynamics protein toggle conformational switch manner similar small molecules shifting relative populations different states subtle modifications process central protein function shown also protein evolution suggests can learn evolution design proteins multiple conformational states
