genome evolution following host jumps irish potato famine pathogen lineage
many plant pathogens including lineage irish potato famine organism phytophthora infestans evolve host jumps followed specialization however host jumps affect genome evolution remains largely unknown determine patterns sequence variation p infestans lineage resequenced six genomes four sister species revealed uneven evolutionary rates across genomes genes repeat-rich regions showing higher rates structural polymorphisms positive selection loci enriched genes induced planta implicating host adaptation genome evolution unexpectedly genes involved epigenetic processes formed another class rapidly evolving residents gene-sparse regions results demonstrate dynamic repeat-rich genome compartments underpin accelerated gene evolution following host jumps pathogen lineage
