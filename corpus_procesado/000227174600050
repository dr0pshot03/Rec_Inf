functional cartography complex metabolic networks 
high-throughput techniques leading explosive growth size biological databases creating opportunity revolutionize understanding life disease interpretation data remains however major scientific challenge propose methodology enables us extract display information contained complex networks- specifically demonstrate can find functional modules complex networks classify nodes universal roles according pattern intra inter-module connections method thus yields cartographic representation complex networks metabolic networks- among challenging biological networks arguably ones potential immediate applicability use method analyse metabolic networks twelve organisms three different superkingdoms find typically % nodes connected nodes within respective modules nodes different roles affected different evolutionary constraints pressures remarkably find metabolites participate reactions connect different modules conserved hubs whose links mostly within single module
