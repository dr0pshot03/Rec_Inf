density multiplication improved lithography directed block copolymer assembly
self-assembling materials spontaneously form structures length scales interest nanotechnology particular case block copolymers thermodynamic driving forces self assembly small low energy defects can get easily trapped directed assembly defect free arrays isolated block copolymer domains densities terabit per square inch chemically patterned surfaces comparing assembled structures chemical pattern density increased factor four size reduced factor two dimensional uniformity vastly improved
