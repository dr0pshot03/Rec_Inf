soil fertility limits carbon sequestration forest ecosystems co2-enriched atmosphere 
northern mid-latitude forests large terrestrial carbon sink- ignoring nutrient limitations large increases carbon sequestration carbon dioxide co2 fertilization expected forests yet forests usually relegated sites moderate poor fertility tree growth often limited nutrient supply particular nitrogen present evidence estimates increases carbon sequestration forests expected partially compensate increasing co2 atmosphere unduly optimistic two forest experiments maturing pines exposed elevated atmospheric co2 co2-induced biomass carbon increment without added nutrients undetectable nutritionally poor site stimulation nutritionally moderate site transient stabilizing marginal gain three years however large synergistic gain higher co2 nutrients detected nutrients added gain even larger poor site threefold higher expected additive effect moderate site twofold higher thus fertility can restrain response wood carbon sequestration increased atmospheric co2 assessment future carbon sequestration consider limitations imposed soil fertility well interactions nitrogen deposition
