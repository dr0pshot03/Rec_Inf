evolution reproductive isolation sexual conflict 
classical population-genetics theory suggests reproductive isolation will evolve fastest small isolated populations1 contrast recent theory suggests divergence occur fastest larger allopatric populations2 rationale behind sexual conflict potentially strongest driver speciation greater larger higher-density populations idea highly controversial3 little experimental support45 show using replicate fly populations varying levels sexual conflict larger dense populations sexual conflict diverged greater degree small populations relaxed conflict result strongly suggests speciation can occur rapidly large populations increased sexual conflict
