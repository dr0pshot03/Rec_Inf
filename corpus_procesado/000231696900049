wave acceleration electrons van allen radiation belts 
van allen radiation belts two regions encircling earth energetic charged particles trapped inside earths magnetic field properties vary according solar activity represent hazard satellites humans space important challenge explain charged particles within belts accelerated high energies several million electron volts show basis analysis rare event outer radiation belt depleted re-formed closer earth long established theory acceleration radial diffusion inadequate electrons accelerated effectively electromagnetic waves frequencies kilohertz wave acceleration can increase electron flux three orders magnitude observed timescale one two days sufficient explain new radiation belt wave acceleration also important jupiter saturn astrophysical objects magnetic fields
