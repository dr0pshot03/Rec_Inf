unique regulatory phase dna methylation early mammalian embryo 
dna methylation highly dynamic mammalian embryogenesis broadly accepted paternal genome actively depleted -methylcytosine fertilization followed passive loss reaches minimum blastocyst stage however model based limited data far base-resolution maps exist support refine generate genome-scale dna methylation maps mouse gametes zygote post-implantation find oocyte already exhibits global hypomethylation particularly specific families long interspersed element long terminal repeat retroelements disparately methylated gametes lower methylation values zygote sperm surprisingly oocyte contributes unique set differentially methylated regions dmrs-including many cpg island promoters-that maintained early embryo lost upon specification absent somatic cells contrast sperm-contributed dmrs largely intergenic become hypermethylated blastocyst stage data provide genome-scale base-resolution timeline dna methylation pre-specified embryo epigenetic modification dynamic returning canonical somatic pattern
