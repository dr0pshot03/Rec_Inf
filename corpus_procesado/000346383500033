catalytic enantioselective synthesis quaternary carbon stereocentres 
quaternary carbon stereocentres-carbon atoms four distinct carbon substituents attached-are common features molecules found nature however recent advances chemical catalysis methods constructing single stereoisomers important structural motif discuss many catalytic enantioselective reactions developed past decade synthesis single stereoisomers organic molecules progress now makes possible incorporate quaternary stereocentres selectively many organic molecules useful medicine agriculture potentially areas flavouring fragrances materials
