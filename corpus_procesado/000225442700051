periodic mesoporous dendrisilicas 
report synthesis new class materials called periodic mesoporous dendrisilicas prepared dendrimers trialkoxysilyl groups outmost shell dendrimers various cores numbers shells used dendrisilica synthesis based acid base-catalyzed hydrolysis trialkoxysilyl groups subsequent template-directed condensation dendrimers ordered template-dendrisilica nanocomposite template can removed organic solvents producing periodic mesoporous dendrisilica whose pore wails consist interconnected dendrimer building blocks
