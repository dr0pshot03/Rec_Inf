fission yeast pot1-tpp1 protects telomeres regulates telomere length 
telomeres specialized chromatin structures protect chromosomal ends protection telomeres pot1 binds telomeric g rich overhang thereby protecting telomeres regulating telomerase mammalian pot1 tpp1 interact constitute part six protein shelterin complex report tpz1 tpp1 homolog fission yeast forms complex pot1 tpz1 binds ccq1 previously undiscovered protein poz1 pot1 associated schizosaccharomyces pombe protect telomeres redundantly regulate telomerase positive negative manners respectively thus pot1 tpz1 complex accomplishes functions recruiting effector molecules ccq1 poz1 moreover poz1 bridges pot1 tpz1 taz1 rap1 thereby connecting single stranded double stranded telomeric dna regions molecular architectures similar mammalian shelterin indicating overall dna protein architecture conserved across evolution
