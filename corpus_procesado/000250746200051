hedgehog regulates smoothened activity inducing conformational switch
hedgehog hh morphogen essential metazoan development seven-transmembrane protein smoothened smo transduces hh signal across plasma membrane smo activated remains poorly understood drosophila melanogaster hh induces phosphorylation multiple ser/thr residues smo carboxy-terminal cytoplasmic tail leading cell surface accumulation activation provide evidence phosphorylation activates smo inducing conformational switch occurs antagonizing multiple arg clusters smo cytoplasmic tail arg clusters inhibit smo blocking cell surface expression keeping inactive conformation maintained intramolecular electrostatic interactions hh-induced phosphorylation disrupts interaction induces conformational switch dimerization smo cytoplasmic tails essential pathway activation increasing number mutations arg clusters progressively activates smo hence employing multiple arg clusters inhibitory elements counteracted differential phosphorylation smo acts rheostat translate graded hh signals distinct responses
