reducing contact time bouncing drop 
surfaces designed drops adhere instead bounce received substantial attention ability stay dry- self-clean- resist icing- drop striking non-wetting surface type will spread maximum diameter- recoil extent completely rebounds leaves solid material- amount time drop contact solid-the contact time-depends inertia capillarity drop internal dissipation surface-liquid interactions- contact time controls extent mass momentum energy exchanged drop surface often advantageous minimize conventional approach minimize surface-liquid interactions can lead contact line pinning- even absence surface interactions drop hydrodynamics imposes minimum contact time conventionally assumed attained axisymmetrically spreading recoiling drops demonstrate possible reduce contact time theoretical limit using superhydrophobic surfaces morphology redistributes liquid mass thereby alters drop hydrodynamics show theoretically experimentally approach allows us reduce overall contact time bouncing drop surface previously thought possible
