high symbiont relatedness stabilizes mutualistic cooperation fungus-growing termites 
unclear mutualistic relationships can stable partners disperse freely possibility forming associations many alternative genotypes theory predicts high symbiont relatedness resolve problem mechanisms enforce rarely studied show african fungus-growing termites propagate single variants termitomyces symbiont despite initiating cultures genetically variable spores habitat high inoculation density substrate followed fusion among clonally related mycelia enhances efficiency spore production proportion strain frequency positive reinforcement results exclusive lifetime association host colony single fungal symbiont hinders evolution cheating findings explain vertical symbiont transmission fungus-growing termites rare evolutionarily derived
