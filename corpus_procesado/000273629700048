zebrafish behavioral profiling links drugs biological targets rest/wake regulation
major obstacle discovery psychoactive drugs inability predict small molecules will alter complex behaviors report development application high-throughput quantitative screen drugs alter behavior larval zebrafish found multidimensional nature observed phenotypes enabled hierarchical clustering molecules according shared behaviors behavioral profiling revealed conserved functions psychotropic molecules predicted mechanisms action poorly characterized compounds addition behavioral profiling implicated new factors ether-a-go-go-related gene erg potassium channels immunomodulators control rest locomotor activity results demonstrate power high-throughput behavioral profiling zebrafish discover characterize psychotropic drugs dissect pharmacology complex behaviors
