palaeotemperature curve precambrian oceans based silicon isotopes cherts
terrestrial sediment record indicates earths climate varied drastically precambrian era million years ago ranging surface temperatures similar higher todays global glaciation events continuous record sea surface temperatures time derived variations oxygen isotope ratios cherts siliceous sediments long-term cooling oceans inferred data- questioned oxygen isotope signature reset exchange hydrothermal fluids deposition sediments show silicon isotopic composition cherts million years old shows systematic variations age support earlier conclusion long-term ocean cooling exclude post-depositional exchange main source isotopic variations agreement lines evidence model silicon cycle precambrian era shows observed silicon isotope variations imply seawater temperature changes degrees c million years ago degrees c million years ago
