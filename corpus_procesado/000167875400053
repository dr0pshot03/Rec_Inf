functional proteins random-sequence library
functional primordial proteins presumably originated random sequences known frequently functional even folded proteins occur collections random sequences used vitro selection messenger rna displayed proteins protein covalently linked carboxy terminus end encoding mrna sample large number distinct random sequences starting library x proteins containing contiguous random amino acids selected functional proteins enriching bind atp selection yielded four new atp-binding proteins appear unrelated anything found current databases biological proteins frequency occurrence functional proteins random-sequence libraries appears similar observed equivalent rna libraries
