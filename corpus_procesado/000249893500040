ac dc josephson effects bose-einstein condensate 
alternating direct-current ac dc josephson effects first discovered system two superconductors macroscopic wavefunctions weakly coupled via tunnelling barrier ac josephson effect- constant chemical potential difference voltage applied causes oscillating current flow barrier frequency proportional chemical potential difference ac josephson effect serves voltage standard dc josephson effect small constant current applied resulting constant supercurrent flowing barrier sense particles feel presence tall tunnelling barrier flow freely driving potential bose-einstein condensates also support josephson effects however plasma oscillations seen single bose-einstein condensate josephson junction ac josephson effect remains elusive observe ac dc josephson effects single bose-einstein condensate josephson junction dc josephson effect observed previously superconducting systems study evident measure chemical potential-current relation bose-einstein condensate josephson junction system constitutes trapped-atom interferometer continuous readout operates basis ac josephson effect addition measured chemical potential-current relation shows device suitable use analogue superconducting quantum interference device sense rotation
