synapses form skeletal muscles lacking neuregulin receptors
formation neuromuscular junction nmj directed reciprocal interactions motor neurons muscle fibers neuregulin nrg agrin motor nerve terminals implicated demonstrate nmjs can form absence nrg receptors erbb2 erbb4 mouse muscle postsynaptic differentiation however induced agrin therefore conclude nrg signaling muscle required nmj formation effects nrg signaling muscle may mediated indirectly schwann cells
