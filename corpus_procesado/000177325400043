predictive identification exonic splicing enhancers human genes 
specific short oligonucleotide sequences enhance pre-mrna splicing present exons termed exonic splicing enhancers eses play important roles constitutive alternative splicing computational method rescue-ese developed predicts sequences ese activity statistical analysis exon-intron splice site composition large data sets human gene sequences used method identified predicted ese motifs representatives motifs found display enhancer activity vivo whereas point mutants sequences exhibited sharply reduced activity motifs identified enable prediction splicing phenotypes exonic mutations human genes
