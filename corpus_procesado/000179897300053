metastable garnet oceanic crust top lower mantle 
oceanic tectonic plates descend earths lower mantle garnet basaltic crust silicate spinel underlying peridotite layer decompose form silicate perovskite-the post-garnet post-spinel transformations respectively recent phase equilibrium studies12 shown post-garnet transformation occurs shallow lower mantle cold slab rather similar to800 km depth earlier studies indicated3- implication subducted basaltic crust unlikely become buoyant enough delaminate enters lower mantle report results kinetic study post-garnet transformation obtained situ x-ray observations using sintered diamond anvils show kinetics post-garnet transformation significantly slower post-spinel transformation7 although metastable spinel quickly breaks temperature k estimate metastable garnet survive order myr even k accordingly expectation subducted oceanic crust buoyant spans much wider depth range top lower mantle transformation kinetics taken account
