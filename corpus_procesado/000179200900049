metabolic network structure determines key aspects functionality regulation
relationship structure function regulation complex cellular networks still largely open question- systems biology aims explain relationship combining experimental theoretical approaches current theories various strengths shortcomings providing integrated predictive description cellular networks specifically dynamic mathematical modelling large-scale networks meets difficulties necessary mechanistic detail kinetic parameters rarely available contrast structure-oriented analyses require network topology well known many cases previous approaches type focus network robustness metabolic phenotype give predictions cellular regulation devise theoretical method simultaneously predicting key aspects network functionality robustness gene regulation network structure alone achieved determining analysing non-decomposable pathways able operate coherently steady state elementary flux modes use example escherichia coli central metabolism illustrate method
