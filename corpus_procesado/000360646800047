quantum squeezing motion mechanical resonator 
according quantum mechanics harmonic oscillator can never completely rest even ground state position will always fluctuations called zero-point motion although zero-point fluctuations unavoidable can manipulated using microwave frequency radiation pressure manipulated thermal fluctuations micrometer-scale mechanical resonator produce stationary quadrature-squeezed state minimum variance times ground state also performed phase-sensitive back-action evading measurements thermal state squeezed times zero-point level results relevant quantum engineering states matter large length scales study decoherence large quantum systems realization ultrasensitive sensing force motion
