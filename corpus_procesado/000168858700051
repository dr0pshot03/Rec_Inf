calmodulin bifurcates local ca2+ signal modulates p/q-type ca2+ channels
acute modulation p/q-type alpha 1a calcium channels neuronal activity-dependent changes intracellular ca2+ concentration may contribute short-term synaptic plasticity- potentially enriching neurocomputational capabilities brain unconventional mechanism channel modulation proposed calmodulin cam may exert two opposing effects individual channels initially promoting facilitation inhibiting inactivation channel opening report dual regulation arises surprising ca2+-transduction capabilities cam first although facilitation inactivation two competing processes require ca2+-cam binding single iq-like domain carboxy tail alpha 1a previously identified cbd cam-binding site detectable role second expression cam mutant impairment four ca2+-binding sites cam1234 eliminates forms modulation result confirms cam ca2+ sensor channel regulation indicates cam may associate channel even local ca2+ concentration rises finally bifunctional capability cam arises bifurcation ca2+ signalling lobes cam: ca2+ binding amino-terminal lobe selectively initiates channel inactivation whereas ca2+ sensing carboxy-terminal lobe induces facilitation lobe-specific detection provides compact means decode local ca2+ signals two ways separately initiate distinct actions single molecular complex
