structure dynamics mid-ocean ridge hydrothermal systems 
sub-seafloor hydrothermal convection mid ocean ridges transfers % earths heat flux can form massive sulfide ore deposits three dimensional 3d structure transient dynamics uncertain using 3d numerical simulations demonstrated convection cells self organize pipelike upflow zones surrounded narrow zones focused relatively warm downflow configuration ensures optimal heat transfer efficient metal leaching ore deposit formation simulated fluid residence times short years concentric flow geometry results nonlinearities fluid properties may influence behavior fluid flow systems earths crust
