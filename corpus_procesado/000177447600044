electron solvation two dimensions 
ultrafast two-photon photoemission used study electron solvation two-dimensional metal/polar-adsorbate interfaces molecular motion causes excess electron solvation manifested dynamic shift electronic energy although initially excited electron delocalized plane interface interactions adsorbate can lead localization method determining spatial extent localized electron plane interface developed spatial extent measured order single adsorbate molecule
