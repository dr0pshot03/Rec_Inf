alpha-synuclein promotes snare-complex assembly vivo vitro 
presynaptic nerve terminals release neurotransmitters repeatedly often high frequency relative isolation neuronal cell bodies repeated release requires cycles soluble n-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor snare-complex assembly disassembly continuous generation reactive snare-protein intermediates although many forms neurodegeneration initiate presynaptically pathogenic mechanisms known functions presynaptic proteins linked neurodegeneration a-synuclein remain unclear show maintenance continuous presynaptic snare-complex assembly required nonclassical chaperone activity mediated synucleins specifically a-synuclein directly bound snare-protein synaptobrevin-/vesicle-associated membrane protein vamp2 promoted snare-complex assembly moreover triple-knockout mice lacking synucleins developed age-dependent neurological impairments exhibited decreased snare-complex assembly died prematurely thus synucleins may function sustain normal snare-complex assembly presynaptic terminal aging
