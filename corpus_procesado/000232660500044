natural selection protein-coding genes human genome
comparisons dna polymorphism within species divergence species enables discovery molecular adaptation evolutionarily constrained genes well differentiation weak strong purifying selection- extent weak negative positive darwinian selection driven molecular evolution different species varies greatly- species drosophila melanogaster showing strong evidence pervasive positive selection- others selfing weed arabidopsis thaliana showing excess deleterious variation within local populations contrast patterns coding sequence polymorphism identified direct sequencing humans genes divergence humans chimpanzees find strong evidence natural selection shaped recent molecular evolution species analysis discovered % potentially informative loci showing evidence rapid amino acid evolution furthermore % potentially informative loci show paucity amino acid differences humans chimpanzees indicating weak negative selection and/or balancing selection operating mutations loci find distribution negatively positively selected genes varies greatly among biological processes molecular functions classes transcription factors show excess rapidly evolving genes whereas others cytoskeletal proteins show excess genes extensive amino acid polymorphism within humans yet little amino acid divergence humans chimpanzees
