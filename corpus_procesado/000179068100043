nbs1 essential dna repair homologous recombination higher vertebrate cells 
double-strand breaks occur dna replication also induced ionizing radiation least two pathways can repair breaks: non-homologous end joining homologous recombination hr although pathways essentially independent one another possible proteins mre11 rad50 xrs2 involved pathways saccharomyces cerevisiae1 vertebrate cells little known exact function mre11-rad50-nbs1 complex repair double-strand breaks mre11-andrad50-null mutations lethal2 show nbs1 essential hr-mediated repair higher vertebrate cells disruption nbs1 reduces gene conversion sister chromatid exchanges similar hr-deficient mutants3 fact site-specific double-strand break repair assay showed notable reduction hr events following generation breaks nbs1-disrupted cells rare recombinants observed nbs1-disrupted cells frequently found aberrant structures possibly arise unusual crossover events suggesting nbs1 complex might required process recombination intermediates
