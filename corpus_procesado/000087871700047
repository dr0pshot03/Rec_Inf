eating human brain senses biochemical change signals satiation precisely occurs unknown even well-established physiological systems like glucose-insulin regulation timing interaction hormonal processes neural events inferred mostly blood sampling- recently neuroimaging studies provided vivo information neuroanatomical correlates regulation energy intake- temporal orchestration systems however crucial integration neuronal hormonal signals control eating behaviour challenge functional magnetic resonance imaging study map also brain will respond food ingestion use temporal clustering analysis technique demonstrate eating-related neural activity peaks two different times distinct localization importantly differentiated responses interacting internal signal plasma insulin results support concept temporal parcellation brain activity reflects different natures stimuli responses moreover study provides neuroimaging basis detecting dynamic processes without prior knowledge timing acute effects medication nutrition brain
