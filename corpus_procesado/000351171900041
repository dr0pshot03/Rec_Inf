thermosensory processing drosophila brain 
drosophila just vertebrates changes external temperature encoded bidirectional opponent thermoreceptor cells: cells excited warming inhibited cooling whereas others excited cooling inhibited warming central circuits process signals understood drosophila specific brain region receives input thermoreceptor cells show distinct genetically identified projection neurons pns brain region excited cooling warming pns excited cooling receive mainly feed-forward excitation cool thermoreceptors contrast pns excited warming warm-pns receive excitation warm thermoreceptors crossover inhibition cool thermoreceptors inhibitory interneurons notably crossover inhibition elicits warming-evoked excitation warming suppresses tonic activity cool thermoreceptors turn disinhibits warm-pns sums feed-forward excitation evoked warming crossover inhibition cancel non-thermal activity noise positively correlated among warm cool thermoreceptor cells reinforcing thermal activity anti-correlated results show central circuits can combine signals bidirectional opponent neurons construct sensitive robust neural codes
