evolution earliest horses driven climate change paleocene-eocene thermal maximum
body size plays critical role mammalian ecology physiology previous research shown many mammals became smaller paleocene-eocene thermal maximum petm timing magnitude change relative climate change unclear high-resolution record continental climate equid body size change shows directional size decrease similar % first similar years petm followed similar % increase recovery phase petm size changes negatively correlated temperature inferred oxygen isotopes mammal teeth probably driven shifts temperature possibly high atmospheric co2 concentrations findings important understanding mammalian evolutionary responses future global warming
