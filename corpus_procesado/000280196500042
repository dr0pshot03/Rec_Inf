muscle dysfunction caused k-atp channel mutation neonatal diabetes neuronal origin 
gain-of-function mutations kir62 kcnj11 pore-forming subunit adenosine triphosphate atp-sensitive potassium k-atp channel cause neonatal diabetes many patients also suffer hypotonia weak flaccid muscles balance problems diabetes arises suppressed insulin secretion overactive k-atp channels pancreatic beta-cells source motor phenotype unknown using mice carrying human kir62 mutation val59-> met59 targeted either muscle nerve show analogous motor impairments originate central nervous system rather muscle peripheral nerves also identify locomotor hyperactivity feature k-atp channel overactivity findings suggest drugs targeted neuronal rather muscle k-atp channels needed treat motor deficits drugs require high blood-brain barrier permeability
