adhesion friction mesoscopic graphite contacts 
weak interlayer binding two-dimensional layered materials graphite gives rise poorly understood low-friction characteristics accurate measurements adhesion forces governing overall mechanical stability also remained elusive report direct mechanical measurement line tension friction forces acting sheared mesoscale graphite structures show friction fundamentally stochastic nature attributable interaction incommensurate interface lattices also measured adhesion energy +/ joules per square meter excellent agreement theoretical models addition bistable all-mechanical memory cell structures rotational bearings realized exploiting position locking provided solely adhesion energy
