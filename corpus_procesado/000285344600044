tidal dissipation strength earths internal magnetic field 
magnetic fields earths surface represent fraction field inside core strength structure internal field poorly known- yet details important understanding geodynamo obtain indirect estimate field strength measurements tidal dissipation tidally driven flow earths liquid core develops internal shear layers distort internal magnetic field generate electric currents ohmic losses damp tidal motions produce detectable signatures earths nutations previously reported evidence anomalous dissipation nutations can explained core-averaged field mt eliminating need high fluid viscosity stronger magnetic field inner-core boundary estimates internal field constrain power required geodynamo
