histone h3 serine phosphorylation aurora b causes hp1 dissociation heterochromatin 
histones subject numerous post-translational modifications epigenetic marks recruit proteins modulate chromatin structure example heterochromatin protein hp1 binds histone h3 lysine residue tri-methylated methyltransferase suv39h refs mitosis h3 also phosphorylated kinase aurora b- although h3 phosphorylation hallmark mitosis function remains mysterious proposed histone phosphorylation controls binding proteins chromatin mechanisms unknown show antibodies mitotic chromosomal antigens associated human autoimmune diseases specifically recognize h3 molecules modified tri-methylation lysine phosphorylation serine h3k9me3s10ph generation h3k9me3s10ph depends suv39h aurora b occurs pericentric heterochromatin mitosis different eukaryotes hp1 typically dissociates chromosomes mitosis- phosphorylation h3 serine inhibited hp1 remains chromosome-bound throughout mitosis h3 phosphorylation aurora b therefore part methyl/ phos switch mechanism displaces hp1 perhaps proteins mitotic heterochromatin
