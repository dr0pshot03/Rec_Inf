genome-wide detection characterization positive selection human populations
advent dense maps human genetic variation now possible detect positive natural selection across human genome report analysis million polymorphisms international hapmap project phase hapmap2 used long-range haplotype methods developed identify alleles segregating population undergone recent selection also developed new methods based cross-population comparisons discover alleles swept near-fixation within population analysis reveals strong candidate regions focusing strongest regions develop heuristic scrutinizing regions identify candidate targets selection complementary analysis identify non-synonymous coding single nucleotide polymorphisms showing regional evidence positive selection examination candidates highlights three cases two genes common biological process apparently undergone positive selection population: large dmd related infection lassa virus west africa slc24a5 slc45a2 involved skin pigmentation europe edar eda2r involved development hair follicles asia
