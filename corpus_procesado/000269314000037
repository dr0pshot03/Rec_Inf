ebi2 mediates b cell segregation outer centre follicle
b cell follicles specialized microenvironments support events necessary humoral immunity- antigen encounter activated b cells initially seek t-cell help follicle-t-zone boundary move interfollicular t-zone distal outer regions follicle- subsequently cells move follicle centre become germinal centre b cells undergo antibody affinity maturation although germinal centres within follicles described ref molecular cues mediating segregation b cells outer centre follicle remained undefined present role orphan g-protein-coupled receptor epstein-barr virus induced molecule ebi2 also known gpr183 process ebi2 expressed mature b cells increases expression early activation downregulated germinal centre b cells ebi2 deficiency mice led reduction early antibody response t-dependent antigen ebi2-deficient b cells failed move outer follicle day activation instead found follicle centre whereas ebi2 overexpression sufficient promote b cell localization outer follicle mixed bone marrow chimaeras ebi2-deficient b cells phenocopied germinal centre b cells preferentially localizing follicle centre downregulation ebi2 wild-type b cells antagonized participation germinal centre reaction impaired studies identify important role ebi2 promoting b cell localization outer follicle show differential expression receptor helps position b cells appropriately mounting t-dependent antibody responses
