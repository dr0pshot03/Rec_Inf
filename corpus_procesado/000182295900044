environmental noise retards auditory cortical development
mammalian auditory cortex normally undergoes rapid progressive functional maturation show rearing infant rat pups continuous moderate-level noise delayed emergence adultlike topographic representational order refinement response selectivity primary auditory cortex a1 long beyond normal developmental benchmarks noise-reared adult rats subsequently exposed pulsed pure-tone stimulus a1 rapidly reorganized demonstrating exposure-driven plasticity characteristic critical period still ongoing results demonstrate a1 organization shaped young animals exposure salient structured acoustic inputs-and implicate noise risk factor abnormal child development
