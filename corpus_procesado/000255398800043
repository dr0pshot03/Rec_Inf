advancing decadal-scale climate prediction north atlantic sector 
climate north atlantic region exhibits fluctuations decadal timescales large societal consequences prominent examples include hurricane activity atlantic1 surface temperature rainfall variations north america2 europe3 northern africa4 although multidecadal variations potentially predictable current state ocean known5- lack subsurface ocean observations8 constrain state limiting factor realizing full skill potential predictions9 apply simple approach uses sea surface temperature sst observations partly overcome difficulty perform retrospective decadal predictions climate model skill improved significantly relative predictions made incomplete knowledge ocean state10 particularly north atlantic tropical pacific oceans thus results point towards possibility routine decadal climate predictions using method considering internal natural climate variations projected future anthropogenic forcing make following forecast: next decade current atlantic meridional overturning circulation will weaken long term mean; moreover north atlantic sst european north american surface temperatures will cool slightly whereas tropical pacific sst will remain almost unchanged results suggest global surface temperature may increase next decade natural climate variations north atlantic tropical pacific temporarily offset projected anthropogenic warming
