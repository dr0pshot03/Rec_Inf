retinoic acid controls bilateral symmetry somite formation mouse embryo 
striking characteristic vertebrate embryos bilaterally symmetric body plan particularly obvious level somites derivatives vertebra[ column segmentation presomitic mesoderm must therefore tightly coordinated along left right embryonic sides show mutant mice defective retinoic acid synthesis exhibit delayed somite formation right side asymmetric somite formation correlates left-right desynchronization segmentation clock oscillations data implicate retinoic acid endogenous signal maintains bilateral synchrony mesoderm segmentation therefore controls bilateral symmetry vertebrate embryos
