pathological alpha-synuclein transmission initiates parkinson-like neurodegeneration nontransgenic mice 
parkinsons disease characterized abundant alpha-synuclein alpha-syn neuronal inclusions known lewy bodies lewy neurites massive loss midbrain dopamine neurons however cause-and-effect relationship lewy inclusion formation neurodegeneration remains unclear found wild-type nontransgenic mice single intrastriatal inoculation synthetic alpha-syn fibrils led cell-to-cell transmission pathologic alpha-syn parkinsons-like lewy pathology anatomically interconnected regions lewy pathology accumulation resulted progressive loss dopamine neurons substantia nigra pars compacta adjacent ventral tegmental area accompanied reduced dopamine levels culminating motor deficits recapitulation neurodegenerative cascade thus establishes mechanistic link transmission pathologic alpha-syn cardinal features parkinsons disease
