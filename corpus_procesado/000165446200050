beta-arrestin : receptor-regulated mapk scaffold activation jnk3 
beta arrestins originally discovered context heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide binding protein-coupled receptor gpcr desensitization also function internalization signaling receptors identified c-jun amino-terminal kinase jnk3 binding partner beta arrestin using yeast two-hybrid screen coimmunoprecipitation mouse brain extracts cotransfected cos cells upstream jnk activators apoptosis signal-regulating kinase ask1 mitogen-activated protein kinase mapk kinase also found complex beta arrestin cellular transfection beta arrestin caused cytosolic retention jnk3 enhanced jnk3 phosphorylation stimulated ask1 moreover stimulation angiotensin ii type 1a receptor activated jnk3 triggered colocalization beta arrestin active jnk3 intracellular vesicles thus beta arrestin acts scaffold protein brings spatial distribution activity mapk module control gpcr
