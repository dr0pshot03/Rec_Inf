supershear rupture m-w aftershock sea okhotsk earthquake
earthquake rupture speeds exceeding shear-wave velocity reported several shallow strike-slip events whether supershear rupture also can occur deep earthquakes unclear enigmatic faulting mechanism using empirical greens functions regional teleseismic waveforms observed supershear rupture moment magnitude m-w deep earthquake beneath sea okhotsk aftershock large deep earthquake m-w m-w event ruptured downward along steeply dipping fault plane average speed kilometers per second suggesting efficient seismic energy generation comparing highly dissipative m-w bolivia earthquake two events represent end members deep earthquakes terms energy partitioning imply one rupture mechanism deep earthquakes
