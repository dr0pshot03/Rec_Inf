npas4 regulates transcriptional program ca3 required contextual memory formation 
rapid encoding contextual memory requires ca3 region hippocampus necessary genetic pathways remain unclear found activity-dependent transcription factor npas4 regulates transcriptional program ca3 required contextual memory formation npas4 specifically expressed ca3 contextual learning global knockout selective deletion npas4 ca3 resulted impaired contextual memory restoration npas4 ca3 sufficient reverse deficit global knockout mice recruiting rna polymerase ii promoters enhancers target genes npas4 regulates learning-specific transcriptional program ca3 includes many well-known activity-regulated genes suggests npas4 master regulator activity-regulated gene programs central memory formation
