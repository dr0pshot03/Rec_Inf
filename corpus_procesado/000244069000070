relative impact nucleotide copy number variation gene expression phenotypes 
extensive studies currently performed associate disease susceptibility one form genetic variation namely single-nucleotide polymorphisms snps recent years another type common genetic variation characterized namely structural variation including copy number variants cnvs determine overall contribution cnvs complex phenotypes performed association analyses expression levels transcripts snps cnvs individuals part international hapmap project snps cnvs captured % % total detected genetic variation gene expression respectively signals two types variation little overlap interrogation genome types variants may effective way elucidate causes complex phenotypes disease humans
