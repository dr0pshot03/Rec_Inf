baryons edge x-ray-brightest galaxy cluster 
studies diffuse x-ray-emitting gas galaxy clusters provided powerful constraints cosmological parameters insights plasma astrophysics however measurements faint cluster outskirts become possible recently using data suzaku x-ray telescope determined accurate spatially resolved census gas metals dark matter edge perseus cluster contrary previous results measurements cluster baryon fraction consistent expected universal value half virial radius apparent baryon fraction exceeds cosmic mean larger radii suggesting clumpy distribution gas important understanding ongoing growth clusters surrounding cosmic web
