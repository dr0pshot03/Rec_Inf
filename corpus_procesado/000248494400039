quantized transport graphene p-n junctions magnetic field 
recent experimental work locally gated graphene layers resulting p-n junctions revealed quantum hall effect transport behavior explain observed conductance quantization fractional bipolar regime integer unipolar regime terms quantum hall edge modes propagating along across p-n interface bipolar regime electron hole modes can mix p-n boundary leading current partition quantized shot-noise plateaus similar conductance whereas unipolar regime transport noiseless quantum hall phenomena reflect massless dirac character charge carriers graphene particle/hole interplay manifest mode mixing noise bipolar regime
