harnessing chaperones generate small-molecule inhibitors amyloid beta aggregation 
protein aggregation involved pathogenesis neurodegenerative diseases hence considered attractive target therapeutic intervention however protein-protein interactions exceedingly difficult inhibit small molecules tack sufficient steric bulk prevent interactions large peptide surfaces yield potent inhibitors beta-amyloid abeta aggregation synthesized small molecules increase steric bulk binding chaperones also moiety available interaction abeta strategy yields potent inhibitors abeta aggregation lead therapeutics alzheimers disease forms neurodegeneration
