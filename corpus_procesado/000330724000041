pcp septins compartmentalize cortical actomyosin direct collective cell movement
despite understanding actomyosin function individual migrating cells know little mechanisms actomyosin drives collective cell movement vertebrate embryos collective movements convergent extension drive global reorganization early embryo local remodeling organogenesis report planar cell polarity pcp proteins control convergent extension exploiting evolutionarily ancient function septin cytoskeleton directing septin-mediated compartmentalization cortical actomyosin pcp proteins coordinate specific shortening mesenchymal cell-cell contacts turn powers cell interdigitation data illuminate interface developmental signaling systems fundamental machinery cell behavior provide insights etiology human birth defects spina bifida congenital kidney cysts
