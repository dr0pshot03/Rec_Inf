cyclophilin d-dependent mitochondrial permeability transition regulates necrotic apoptotic cell death 
mitochondria play important role energy production ca2+ homeostasis cell death recent years role mitochondria apoptotic necrotic cell death attracted much attention apoptosis necrosis mitochondrial permeability transition mpt leads disruption mitochondrial membranes mitochondrial dysfunction considered one key events although exact role cell death remains elusive therefore created mice lacking cyclophilin d cypd protein considered involved mpt analyse role cell death cypd-deficient mice developmentally normal showed apparent anomalies cypd-deficient mitochondria undergo cyclosporin a-sensitive mpt cypd-deficient cells died normally response various apoptotic stimuli showed resistance necrotic cell death induced reactive oxygen species ca2+ overload addition cypd-deficient mice showed high level resistance ischaemia/reperfusion-induced cardiac injury results indicate cypd-dependent mpt regulates forms necrotic death apoptotic death
