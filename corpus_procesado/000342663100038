vibrational spectroscopy electron microscope
vibrational spectroscopies using infrared radiation raman scattering neutrons low-energy electrons inelastic electron tunnelling powerful techniques can analyse bonding arrangements identify chemical compounds probe many important properties materials spatial resolution spectroscopies typically one micrometre although can reach tens nanometres even angstroms enhanced presence sharp metallic tip vibrational spectroscopy combined spatial resolution flexibility transmission electron microscope open study vibrational modes many different types nanostructures unfortunately energy resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy performed electron microscope now poor allow combination recent developments improved attainable energy resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy scanning transmission electron microscope around ten millielectronvolts now allow vibrational spectroscopy carried electron microscope describe innovations responsible progress present examples applications inorganic organic materials including detection hydrogen also demonstrate vibrational signal high-and low-spatial-resolution components first component can used map vibrational features nanometre-level resolution second component can used analysis carried beam positioned just outside sample-that aloof spectroscopy largely avoids radiation damage
