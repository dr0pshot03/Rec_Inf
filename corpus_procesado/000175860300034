open pore conformation potassium channels 
living cells regulate activity ion channels process known gating open pore protein conformational changes must occur within channels membrane-spanning ion pathway kcsa mthk closed opened k+ channels respectively reveal gating transitions occur pore-lining inner helices contain gating hinge bends approximately 30degrees straight conformation four inner helices form bundle closing pore near intracellular surface bent configuration inner helices splay open creating wide angstrom entryway amino-acid sequence conservation suggests common structural basis gating wide range k+ channels ligand voltage-gated open conformation favours high conduction compressing membrane field selectivity filter also permits large organic cations inactivation peptides enter pore intracellular solution
