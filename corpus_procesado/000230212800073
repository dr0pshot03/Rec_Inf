cell-to-cell transfer bacterial outer membrane lipoproteins
myxococcus xanthus cells can glide forward retracting type iv pili tgl outer membrane lipoprotein necessary assemble pili tgl+ mutants can transiently stimulated brought end-to-end contact tgl+ donor cells separating stimulated recipient cells donor cells found tgl protein transferred donors rescued recipient cells mutants lacking cglb lipoprotein part second gliding engine also stimulated cglb protein transferred donor recipient cells high transfer efficiency tgl cglb proteins suggests donor recipient cells briefly fuse outer membranes
