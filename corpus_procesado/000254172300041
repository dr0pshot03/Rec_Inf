activation foxo1 cdk1 cycling cells postmitotic neurons
activation cyclin dependent kinase cdk1 linked cell death postmitotic neurons brain development disease found cdk1 phosphorylated transcription factor foxo1 ser vitro vivo phosphorylation foxo1 ser disrupted foxo1 binding proteins thereby promoted nuclear accumulation foxo1 stimulated foxo1-dependent transcription leading cell death neurons proliferating cells cdk1 induced foxo1 ser phosphorylation g/m phase cell cycle resulting foxo1 dependent expression mitotic regulator polo like kinase plk findings define conserved signaling link cdk1 foxo1 may key role diverse biological processes including degeneration postmitotic neurons
