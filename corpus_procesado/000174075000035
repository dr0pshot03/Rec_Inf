nebula gases io surrounding jupiter 
several planetary missions reported- presence substantial numbers energetic ions electrons surrounding jupiter relativistic electrons observable several astronomical units au planet population energetic > kev neutral particles also reported instrumentation able determine mass charge state particles subsequently labelled energetic neutral atoms although images showing presence trace element sodium obtained source identity neutral atoms-and overall significance relative loss charged particles jupiters magnetosphere-were unknown report discovery cassini spacecraft fast > km s- hot magnetospheric neutral wind extending au jupiter presence energetic neutral atoms hot cold accelerated electric field solar wind suggest atoms originate volcanic gases io undergo significant evolution various electromagnetic interactions escape jupiters magnetosphere populate environment around planet thus nebula created extends outwards hundreds jovian radii
