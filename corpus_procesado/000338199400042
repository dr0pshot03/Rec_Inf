sonic hedgehog factor gli1 imparts drug resistance inducible glucuronidation
drug resistance major hurdle oncology responses acute myeloid leukaemia aml patients cytarabine ara-c-based therapies often short lived median overall survival months- therapies development improve outcomes include targeting eukaryotic translation initiation factor eif4e inhibitor ribavirin- phase ii clinical trial poor prognosis aml ribavirin monotherapy yielded promising responses including remissions however patients relapsed identify novel form drug resistance ribavirin ara-c observe sonic hedgehog transcription factor glioma-associated protein gli1 udp glucuronosyltransferase ugt1a family enzymes elevated resistant cells ugt1as add glucuronic acid many drugs modifying activity diverse tissues gli1 alone sufficient drive ugt1a-dependent glucuronidation ribavirin ara-c thus drug resistance resistance overcome genetic pharmacological inhibition gli1 revealing potential strategy overcome drug resistance patients
