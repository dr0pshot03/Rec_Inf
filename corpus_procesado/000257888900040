argonaute transports sirnas cytoplasm nucleus
ribonucleoprotein complexes consisting argonaute like proteins small regulatory rnas function wide range biological processes many small regulatory rnas predicted act least part within nucleus conducted genetic screen identify factors essential rna interference rnai nuclei caenorhabditis elegans identified argonaute protein nrde absence small interfering rnas sirnas nrde resides cytoplasm nrde binds sirnas generated rna dependent rna polymerases acting messenger rna templates cytoplasm redistributes nucleus nuclear redistribution nrde requires functional nuclear localization signal required nuclear rnai results nrde association nuclear localized nascent transcripts thus specific argonaute proteins can transport specific classes small regulatory rnas distinct cellular compartments regulate gene expression
