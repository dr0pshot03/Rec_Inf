prc2 loss amplifies ras-driven transcription confers sensitivity brd4-based therapies 
polycomb repressive complex prc2 exerts oncogenic effects many tumour types however loss-of-function mutations prc2 components occur subset haematopoietic malignancies suggesting complex plays dichotomous poorly understood role cancer provide genomic cellular mouse modelling data demonstrating polycomb group gene suz12 functions tumour suppressor pns tumours high-grade gliomas melanomas cooperating mutations nf1 nf1 encodes ras gtpase-activating protein rasgap loss drives cancer activating ras show suz12 loss potentiates effects nf1 mutations amplifying ras-driven transcription effects chromatin importantly however suz12 inactivation also triggers epigenetic switch sensitizes cancers bromodomain inhibitors collectively studies reveal unexpected connection prc2 complex nf1 ras also identify promising epigenetic-based therapeutic strategy may exploited variety cancers
