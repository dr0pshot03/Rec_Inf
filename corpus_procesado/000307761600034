mutations profilin gene cause familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis als late-onset neurodegenerative disorder resulting motor neuron death approximately % cases familial fals typically dominant inheritance mode despite numerous advances recent years1- nearly % fals cases unknown genetic aetiology show mutations within profilin pfn1 gene can cause fals pfn1 crucial conversion monomeric g-actin filamentous f-actin exome sequencing two large als families showed different mutations within pfn1 gene sequence analysis identified mutations fals cases cells expressing pfn1 mutants contain ubiquitinated insoluble aggregates many cases contain als-associated protein tdp- pfn1 mutants also display decreased bound actin levels can inhibit axon outgrowth furthermore primary motor neurons expressing mutant pfn1 display smaller growth cones reduced f/g-actin ratio observations document cytoskeletal pathway alterations contribute als pathogenesis
