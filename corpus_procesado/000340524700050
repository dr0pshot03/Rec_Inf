chromatin state dynamics blood formation 
chromatin modifications crucial development yet little known dynamics differentiation hematopoiesis provides well-defined model study chromatin state dynamics however technical limitations impede profiling homogeneous differentiation intermediates developed high-sensitivity indexing-first chromatin immunoprecipitation approach profile dynamics four chromatin modifications across stages hematopoietic differentiation identify enhancer regions characterize dynamics find lineage commitment involves de novo establishment lineage-specific enhancers enhancer repertoire expansions foreshadow transcriptional programs differentiated cells combining enhancer catalog gene expression profiles elucidate transcription factor network controlling chromatin dynamics lineage specification hematopoiesis together results provide comprehensive model chromatin dynamics development
