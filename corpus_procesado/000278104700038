grain growth stops: mechanism grain-growth stagnation pure materials 
thermodynamic equilibrium state crystalline materials single crystal; however polycrystalline grain growth almost always stops state reached although typically attributed solute drag grain-growth stagnation occurs even high-purity materials recent studies indicate grain boundaries undergo thermal roughening associated abrupt mobility change typical annealing temperatures polycrystals will contain smooth slow rough fast boundaries mesoscale grain-growth models validated large-scale polycrystalline molecular dynamics simulations show even small fractions smooth slow boundaries can stop grain growth conclude grain-boundary roughening provides alternate stagnation mechanism applies even high-purity materials
