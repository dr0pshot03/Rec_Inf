mammalian sad kinases required neuronal polarization
electrical activity neurons generally initiated dendritic processes propagated along axons synapses passed neurons major structural features neurons-their dendrites axons-are thus related fundamental functions: receipt transmission information acquisition distinct properties dendrites axons called polarization critical step neuronat differentiation show sad-a sad-b mammalian orthologs kinase needed presynaptic differentiation caenorhabditis elegans required neuronal polarization kinases will provide entry points unraveling signaling mechanisms polarize neurons
