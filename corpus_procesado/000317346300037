recent temperature extremes high northern latitudes unprecedented past years
recently observed extreme temperatures high northern latitudes- rare definition making longer time span afforded climate proxies important assessing frequency extremes may changing previous reconstructions past temperature variability demonstrated recent warmth anomalous relative preceding centuries millennia extreme events can thoroughly evaluated using spatially resolved approach provides ensemble possible temperature histories using hierarchical bayesian analysis instrumental tree-ring ice-core lake-sediment records show magnitude frequency recent warm temperature extremes high northern latitudes unprecedented past years summers warmer prior years back probability p > terms spatial average summer warmest previous years western russia p > probably warmest western greenland canadian arctic well p > recent extremes greatly exceed expected stationary climate can understood resulting constant space-time variability increased mean temperature
