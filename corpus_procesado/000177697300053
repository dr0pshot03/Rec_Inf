fluidity bound hydration layers 
measured shear forces solid surfaces sliding past across aqueous salt solutions pressures concentrations typical naturally occurring systems systems surface-attached hydration layers keep compressed surfaces apart result strongly repulsive hydration forces find however bound water molecules retain shear fluidity characteristic bulk liquid even compressed films +/ nanometer thick attribute ready exchange opposed loss water molecules within hydration layers rub past strong compression
