earthquake slip oceanic transform faults
oceanic transform faults one main types plate boundary manner slip remains poorly understood early studies suggested relatively slow earthquake rupture might common moreover reported slow slip precedes oceanic transform earthquakes including romanche earthquake- presence detectable precursors obvious implications earthquake prediction model broadband seismograms body waves obtain well-resolved depths rupture mechanisms earthquakes romanche chain transform faults equatorial atlantic ocean found earthquakes longer romanche transform systematically deeper neighbouring chain transform depths indicate maximum depth brittle failure temperature similar degreesc oceanic lithosphere rnd body waves romanche earthquake can well modelled relatively deep slip single fault use mechanism depth earthquake recalculate source spectrum previously reported slow precursor can explained artefact uncertainties assumed model parameters
