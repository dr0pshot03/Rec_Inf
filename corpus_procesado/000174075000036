ultraviolet emissions magnetic footprints io ganymede europa jupiter 
io leaves magnetic footprint jupiters upper atmosphere appears spot ultraviolet emission remains fixed underneath io jupiter rotates- specific physical mechanisms responsible generating emissions well understood general spot seems arise electromagnetic interaction jupiters magnetic field plasma surrounding io driving currents around million amperes jupiters ionosphere- galilean satellites may also leave footprints presence absence footprints illuminate underlying physical mechanism revealing strengths currents linking satellites jupiter report persistent faint far-ultraviolet emission jovian footprints ganymede europa also show ios magnetic footprint extends well beyond immediate vicinity ios flux-tube interaction jupiter much farther predicted theoretically- emission persists several hours downstream infer data ganymede europa persistent interactions jupiters magnetic field despite thin atmospheres
