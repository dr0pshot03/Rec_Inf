structure mechanism m2 proton channel influenza virus 
integral membrane protein m2 influenza virus forms ph-gated proton channels viral lipid envelope low ph endosome activates m2 channel haemagglutinin-mediated fusion conductance protons acidifies viral interior thereby facilitates dissociation matrix protein viral nucleoproteins required process unpacking viral genome addition role release viral nucleoproteins m2 trans golgi network tgn membrane prevents premature conformational rearrangement newly synthesized haemagglutinin transport cell surface equilibrating ph tgn host cell cytoplasm inhibiting proton conductance m2 using anti viral drug amantadine rimantadine inhibits viral replication- present structure tetrameric m2 channel complex rimantadine determined nmr closed state four tightly packed transmembrane helices define narrow channel tryptophan gate locked intermolecular interactions aspartic acid carboxy terminal amphipathic helix oriented nearly perpendicular transmembrane helix forms inward facing base lowering ph destabilizes transmembrane helical packing unlocks gate admitting water conduct protons whereas c terminal base remains intact preventing dissociation tetramer rimantadine binds four equivalent sites near gate lipid facing side channel stabilizes closed conformation pore drug-resistance mutations predicted counter effect drug binding either increasing hydrophilicity pore weakening helix helix packing thus facilitating channel opening
