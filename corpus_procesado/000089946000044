modulation instability pattern formation spatially incoherent light beams
report experimental observation modulation instability partially spatially incoherent light beams noninstantaneous nonlinear media show systems patterns can form spontaneously noise incoherent modulation instability occurs specific threshold depends coherence properties correlation distance wave packet leads periodic train one-dimensional filaments higher value nonlinearity incoherent one-dimensional filaments display two-dimensional instability break self-ordered arrays light spots discovery incoherent pattern formation reflects many nonlinear systems beyond optics implies patterns can form spontaneously noise diverse nonlinear many-body systems involving weakly correlated particles atomic gases near bose-einstein condensation temperatures electrons semiconductors vicinity quantum hall regime
