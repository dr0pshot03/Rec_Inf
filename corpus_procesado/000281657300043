prediction individual brain maturity using fmri
group functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging fcmri studies documented reliable changes human functional brain maturity development show support vector machine-based multivariate pattern analysis extracts sufficient information fcmri data make accurate predictions individuals brain maturity across development use minutes resting-state fcmri data scans typically developing volunteers ages years allowed prediction individual brain maturity functional connectivity maturation index resultant functional maturation curve accounted % sample variance followed nonlinear asymptotic growth curve shape greatest relative contribution predicting individual brain maturity made weakening short-range functional connections adult brains major functional networks
