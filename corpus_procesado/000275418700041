toward extracting phylogenetic information matrices evolutionary distances 
matrix evolutionary distances model-based statistic derived molecular sequences summarizing pairwise phylogenetic relations collection species phylogenetic tree reconstruction methods relying matrix relatively fast thus widely used molecular systematics however intrinsic reliance summary statistics distance-matrix methods assumed less accurate likelihood-based approaches paper pairwise sequence comparisons shown powerful previously hypothesized statistical analysis certain distance-based techniques indicates data requirement large evolutionary trees essentially matches conjectured performance maximum likelihood methods-challenging idea summary statistics lead suboptimal analyses basis connection ancestral state reconstruction distance averaging critical role played covariances distance matrix identified
