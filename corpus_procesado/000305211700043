three-stage symbiosis forms foundation seagrass ecosystems
seagrasses evolved terrestrial plants marine foundation species around million years ago ecological success however remains mystery natural organic matter accumulation within beds result toxic sediment sulfide levels using meta-analysis field study laboratory experiment reveal ancient three-stage symbiosis seagrass lucinid bivalves sulfide-oxidizing gill bacteria reduces sulfide stress seagrasses found bivalve-sulfide-oxidizer symbiosis reduced sulfide levels enhanced seagrass production measured biomass turn bivalves endosymbionts profit organic matter accumulation radial oxygen release seagrass roots findings elucidate long-term success seagrasses warm waters offer new prospects seagrass ecosystem conservation
