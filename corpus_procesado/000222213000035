laser-induced ultrafast spin reorientation antiferromagnet tmfeo3 
magnetically ordered materials can divided two primary classes: ferromagnets antiferromagnets since ancient times ferromagnetic materials found vast application areas compass computer storage recently magnetic random access memory spintronics contrast antiferromagnetic afm materials though representing overwhelming majority magnetically ordered materials long time academic interest fundamental difference two types magnetic materials manifests reaction external magnetic field-in antiferromagnet exchange interaction leads zero net magnetization related absence net angular momentum result orders magnitude faster afm spin dynamics show using short laser pulse spins antiferromagnet tmfeo3 can indeed manipulated timescale picoseconds contrast hundreds picoseconds ferromagnet- ultrafast dynamics spins antiferromagnets key issue exchange-biased devices finding can expand now limited set applications afm materials
