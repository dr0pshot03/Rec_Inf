coherent electronic fringe structure incommensurate silver-silicon quantum wells 
atomically uniform silver films grown highly doped n-type si substrates show fine-structured electronic fringes near silicon valence band edge observed angle-resolved photoemission fringes observed silver films grown lightly doped n-type substrates p-type substrates although cases exhibited usual quantum-well states corresponding electron confinement film fringes correspond electronic states extending silver film quantum well reaching silicon substrate quantum slope two parts coherently coupled incommensurate interface structure
