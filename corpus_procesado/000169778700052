predators increase risk catastrophic extinction prey populations 
considerable research top-down effects disturbances- ecological communities however interaction two disturbance catastrophic rarely examined predators may increase probability prey extinction resulting catastrophic disturbance reducing prey population size changing ecological traits prey individuals habitat characteristics way increases vulnerability prey species extinction show major hurricane bahamas led extinction lizard populations islands onto predator experimentally introduced whereas populations became extinct control islands hurricane predator reduced prey populations half control islands two months hurricane found recently hatched individuals-apparently lizards survived inundating storm surge eggs predator-introduction islands hatchling populations smaller fraction pre-hurricane populations control islands egg survival allowed rapid recovery prey populations pre-hurricane levels control islands third predator-introduction islands-the two-thirds lost prey populations thus climatic disturbance compounded predation brought prey populations extinction
