ifn gamma lymphocytes prevent primary tumour development shape tumour immunogenicity 
lymphocytes originally thought form basis cancer immunosurveillance process protects immunocompetent hosts primary tumour development idea largely abandoned differences primary tumour development found athymic nude mice syngeneic wild-type mice- however subsequent observations nude mice completely lack functional t cells two components immune system-ifn gamma perforin--help prevent tumour formation mice led renewed interest tumour-suppressor role immune response show lymphocytes ifn gamma collaborate protect development carcinogen-induced sarcomas spontaneous epithelial carcinomas also select tumour cells reduced immunogenicity immune response thus functions effective extrinsic tumour-suppressor system however process also leads immunoselection tumour cells capable surviving immunocompetent host explains apparent paradox tumour formation immunologically intact individuals
