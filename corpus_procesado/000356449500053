endocytic sites mature continuous bending remodeling clathrin coat
clathrin-mediated endocytosis cme plasma membrane regions internalized retrieve extracellular molecules cell surface components whether endocytosis occurs direct clathrin assembly curved lattices budding vesicle initial recruitment flat membranes subsequent reshaping controversial distinguish models combined fluorescence microscopy electron tomography locate endocytic sites determine coat membrane shapes invagination curvature clathrin coat increased whereas coated surface area remained nearly constant furthermore clathrin rapidly exchanged stages cme thus coated vesicle budding appears involve bending dynamic preassembled clathrin coat
