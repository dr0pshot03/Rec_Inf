self-healing thermoreversible rubber supramolecular assembly
rubbers exhibit enormous extensibility several hundred per cent compared per cent ordinary solids ability recover original shape dimensions release stress rubber elasticity property macromolecules either covalently cross linked connected network physical associations small glassy crystalline domains- ionic aggregates multiple hydrogen bonds- covalent cross-links strong physical associations prevent flow creep design synthesize molecules associate together form chains cross-links via hydrogen bonds system shows recoverable extensibility several hundred per cent little creep load striking contrast conventional cross-linked thermoreversible rubbers made macromolecules systems broken cut can simply repaired bringing together fractured surfaces self heal room temperature repaired samples recuperate enormous extensibility process breaking healing can repeated many times materials can easily processed re used recycled unique self-repairing properties simplicity synthesis availability renewable resources low cost raw ingredients fatty acids urea bode well future applications
