supramolecular dendritic liquid quasicrystals
large number synthetic natural compounds self-organize bulk phases exhibiting periodicities --- metre scale consequence molecular shape degree amphiphilic character often presence additional non-covalent interactions phases found lyotropic systems example lipid-water soap-water range block copolymers thermotropic solvent-free liquid crystals resulting periodicity can one-dimensional lamellar phases two-dimensional columnar phases three dimensional micellar bicontinuous phases two three-dimensional structures identified date obey rules crystallography symmetry can described respectively one plane groups space groups micellar phases crystallographic counterparts transition-metal alloys just one metal atom equivalent --atom micelle however metal alloys known defy rules crystallography form so-called quasicrystals rotational symmetry allowed two- three- four six-fold symmetry show quasiperiodic structures can also exist scaled-up micellar phases representing new mode organization soft matter
