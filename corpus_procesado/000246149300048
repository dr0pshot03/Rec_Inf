intrinsic functional architecture anaesthetized monkey brain 
traditional approach studying brain function measure physiological responses controlled sensory motor cognitive paradigms however brains energy consumption devoted ongoing metabolic activity clearly associated particular stimulus behaviour1 functional magnetic resonance imaging studies humans aimed understanding ongoing activity shown spontaneous fluctuations blood-oxygen-level-dependent signal occur continuously resting state humans fluctuations temporally coherent within widely distributed cortical systems recapitulate functional architecture responses evoked experimentally administered tasks2-\ show phenomenon present anaesthetized monkeys even anaesthetic levels known induce profound loss consciousness specifically demonstrate coherent spontaneous fluctuations within three well known systems oculomotor somatomotor visual default system set brain regions thought support uniquely human capabilities results indicate coherent system fluctuations probably reflect evolutionarily conserved aspect brain functional organization transcends levels consciousness
