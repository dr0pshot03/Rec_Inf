sample dimensions influence strength crystal plasticity 
crystal deforms plastically phenomena dislocation storage multiplication motion pinning nucleation occur submicron-to-nanometer scale report measurements plastic yielding single crystals micrometer-sized dimensions three different types metals find within tests overall sample dimensions artificially limit length scales available plastic processes results show dramatic size effects surprisingly large sample dimensions results emphasize micrometer scale one must de ne external geometry internal structure characterize strength material
