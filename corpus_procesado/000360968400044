viruses transfer antiviral second messenger cgamp cells
cyclic gmp-amp synthase cgas detects cytosolic dna virus infection induces antiviral state cgas signals synthesis second messenger cyclic gmp-amp cgamp activates stimulator interferon genes sting show cgamp incorporated viral particles including lentivirus herpesvirus virions produced cgas-expressing cells virions transferred cgamp newly infected cells triggered sting-dependent antiviral program effects independent exosomes viral nucleic acids results reveal way signal innate immunity transferred cells potentially accelerating broadening antiviral responses moreover infection dendritic cells cgamp-loaded lentiviruses enhanced activation loading viral vectors cgamp therefore holds promise vaccine development
