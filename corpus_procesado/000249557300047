differential notch signalling distinguishes neural stem cells intermediate progenitors 
brain development neurons glia generated germinal zone containing neural stem cells nscs limited intermediate neural progenitors inps- signalling events distinguish two proliferative neural cell types remain poorly understood notch signalling pathway known maintain nsc character inhibit neurogenesis although little known role notch signalling inps show nscs inps respond notch receptor activation nscs signal canonical notch effector c-promoter binding factor cbf1 whereas inps attenuated cbf1 signalling furthermore whereas knock-down cbf1 promotes conversion nscs inps activation cbf1 insufficient convert inps back nscs using transgenic transient vivo reporter assays show nscs inps coexist telencephalic ventricular zone can prospectively separated basis cbf1 activity furthermore using vivo transplantation show whereas nscs generate neurons astrocytes oligodendrocytes similar frequencies inps predominantly neurogenic together previous work haematopoietic stem cells study suggests use blockade cbf1 cascade downstream notch general feature distinguishing stem cells limited progenitors variety tissues
