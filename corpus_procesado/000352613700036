substrate degradation proteasome: single-molecule kinetic analysis 
address configuration conjugated ubiquitins determines recognition substrates proteasome analyzed degradation kinetics substrates chemically defined ubiquitin configurations contrary view tetraubiquitin chain minimal signal efficient degradation find distributing ubiquitins diubiquitin chains provides efficient signal understand proteasome actually discriminates among ubiquitin configurations developed single-molecule assays distinguished intermediate steps degradation kinetically level ubiquitin substrate drives proteasome-substrate interaction whereas chain structure ubiquitin affects translocation axial channel proteasome together two features largely determine susceptibility substrates proteasomal degradation
