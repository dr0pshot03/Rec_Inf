influence inositol pyrophosphates cellular energy dynamics 
high-energy phosphate bonds adenosine triphosphate atp main intracellular energy carrier also functions signaling pathways phosphate donor precursor cyclic adenosine monophosphate show inositol pyrophosphates participate control intracellular atp concentration yeasts devoid inositol pyrophosphates dysfunctional mitochondria paradoxically contain four times much atp increased glycolysis demonstrate inositol pyrophosphates control activity major glycolytic transcription factor gcr1 thus inositol pyrophosphates regulate atp concentration altering glycolytic/mitochondrial metabolic ratio metabolic reprogramming inositol pyrophosphates evolutionary conserved mechanism also preserved mammalian systems
