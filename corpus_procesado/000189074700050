nervy links protein kinase plexin-mediated semaphorin repulsion
cyclic nucleotides regulate axonal responses number guidance cues unknown molecular events report drosophila nervy member myeloid translocation gene family kinase anchoring proteins akaps regulates repulsive axon guidance linking cyclic adenosine monophosphate camp-dependent protein kinase pka semaphorin 1a sema-1a receptor plexin plexa nervy pka antagonize sema-1a-plexa-mediated repulsion akap binding region nervy critical effect thus nervy couples camp-pka signaling plexa regulate sema-1a-mediated axonal repulsion revealing simple molecular mechanism allows growing axons integrate inputs multiple guidance cues
