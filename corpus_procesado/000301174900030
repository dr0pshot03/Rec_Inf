piezo proteins pore-forming subunits mechanically activated channels
mechanotransduction important role physiology biological processes including sensing touch sound waves require as-yet-unidentified cation channels detect pressure mouse piezo1 mmpiezo1 mmpiezo2 also called fam38a fam38b respectively induce mechanically activated cationic currents cells however unknown whether piezo proteins pore-forming ion channels modulate ion channels show drosophila melanogaster piezo dmpiezo also called cg8486 also induces mechanically activated currents cells channels remarkably distinct pore properties including sensitivity pore blocker ruthenium red single channel conductances mmpiezo1 assembles similar -million-dalton homo-oligomer evidence proteins complex purified mmpiezo1 reconstituted asymmetric lipid bilayers liposomes forms ruthenium-red-sensitive ion channels data demonstrate piezo proteins evolutionarily conserved ion channel family involved mechanotransduction
