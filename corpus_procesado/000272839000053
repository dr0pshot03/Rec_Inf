bacterial community variation human body habitats across space time
elucidating biogeography bacterial communities human body critical establishing healthy baselines detect differences associated diseases obtain integrated view spatial temporal distribution human microbiota surveyed bacteria sites seven nine healthy adults four occasions found community composition determined primarily body habitat within habitats interpersonal variability high whereas individuals exhibited minimal temporal variability several skin locations harbored diverse communities gut mouth skin locations differed community assembly patterns results indicate microbiota although personalized varies systematically across body habitats time trends may ultimately reveal microbiome changes cause prevent disease
