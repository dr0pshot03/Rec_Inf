designing intermediate-range order amorphous materials
amorphous materials commonly understood consist random organizations molecular-type structural units however long known structural organizations intermediate discrete chemical bonds periodic crystalline lattices present even liquids numerous models-including random networks crystalline-type structures networks composed clusters voids-have proposed account intermediate-range order nevertheless understanding controlling structural features determine intermediate-range order amorphous materials remain fundamental yet presently unresolved issues- characteristic signature order first peak total structure factor referred first sharp diffraction peak low q structure features correspond large real-space distances materials understanding origin key unravelling details intermediate-range order employ principles crystal engineering design specific patterns intermediate-range order within amorphous zinc-chloride networks using crystalline models demonstrate impact various structural features diffraction low values q amorphous network engineering anticipated provide structure/property relationships necessary tailor specific optical electronic mechanical properties
