converting ceria polyhedral nanoparticles single-crystal nanospheres
ceria nanoparticles one key abrasive materials chemical-mechanical planarization advanced integrated circuits however ceria nanoparticles synthesized existing techniques irregularly faceted scratch silicon wafers increase defect concentrations developed approach large-scale synthesis single-crystal ceria nanospheres can reduce polishing defects % increase silica removal rate % facilitating precise reliable mass-manufacturing chips nanoelectronics doped ceria system titanium using flame temperatures facilitate crystallization ceria yet retain titania molten state conjunction molecular dynamics simulation show conditions inner ceria core evolves single-crystal spherical shape without faceting throughout crystallization completely encapsulated molten nanometer shell titania liquid state minimizes surface energy principle demonstrated applied oxide systems
