architecture mammalian mechanosensitive piezol channel
piezo proteins evolutionarily conserved functionally diverse mechanosensitive cation channels however overall structural architecture gating mechanisms piezo channels remained unknown determine cryo-electron microscopy structure full-length amino acids mouse piezol piezol resolution angstrom piezol forms trimeric propeller-like structure kilodalton extracellular domains resembling three distal blades central cap transmembrane region apparently resolved segments per subunit segments form three peripheral wings central pore module encloses potential ion-conducting pore rather flexible extracellular blade domains connected central intracellular domain three long beam-like structures trimeric architecture suggests piezol may use peripheral regions force sensors gate central ion-conducting pore
