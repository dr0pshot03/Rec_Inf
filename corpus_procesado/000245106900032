asymmetric t lymphocyte division initiation adaptive immune responses
hallmark mammalian immunity heterogeneity cell fate exists among pathogen-experienced lymphocytes show dividing t lymphocyte initially responding microbe exhibits unequal partitioning proteins mediate signaling cell fate specification asymmetric cell division asymmetric segregation determinants appears coordinated prolonged interaction t cell antigen-presenting cell division additionally first two daughter t cells displayed phenotypic functional indicators differentially fated toward effector memory lineages results suggest mechanism single lymphocyte can apportion diverse cell fates necessary adaptive immunity
