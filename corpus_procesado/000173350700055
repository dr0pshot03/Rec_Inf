dynamics constancy cortical spatiotemporal patterns orientation processing
high selectivity stimulus orientation emerge visual cortex thalamic feedforward-dominated models orientation selectivity predict constant selectivity visual response whereas intracortical recurrent models predict dynamic improvement selectivity imaged cat visual cortex voltage-sensitive dyes measure orientation-tuning dynamics large neuronal population tuning-curve width narrow response onset whereas difference preferred orthogonal responses modulation depth first increased declined identified suppression evoked responses referred evoked deceleration-acceleration da notch larger orthogonal response furthermore peak selectivity tuning curves contemporaneous evoked da notch findings suggest cat brain sustained visual cortical processing narrow orientation tuning rather intracortical interactions may amplify modulation depth suppress orthogonal response relatively preferred thus feedforward models recurrent models orientation selectivity must combined
