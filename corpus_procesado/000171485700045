selective assembly surface supramolecular aggregates controlled size shape 
realization molecule-based miniature devices advanced functions requires development new efficient approaches combining molecular building blocks desired functional structures ideally structures supported suitable substrates- supramolecular aggregation occurs spontaneously can lead controlled structures selective directional non-covalent interactions exploited selective supramolecular assembly yielded almost exclusively crystals dissolved structures self-assembly absorbed molecules larger structures- contrast yet directed controlling selective intermolecular interactions report formation surface-supported supramolecular structures whose size aggregation pattern rationally controlled tuning non-covalent interactions individual absorbed molecules using low-temperature scanning tunnelling microscopy show substituted porphyrin molecules adsorbed gold surface form monomers trimers tetramers extended wire-like structures rnd structure corresponds predictable fashion geometric chemical nature porphyrin substituents mediate interactions individual adsorbed molecules findings suggest careful placement functional groups able participate directed noncovalent interactions will allow rational design construction wide range supramolecular architectures absorbed surfaces
