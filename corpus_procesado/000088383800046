state-dependent cross-inhibition transmitter-gated cation channels
transmitter-gated cation channels detectors excitatory chemical signals synapses nervous system show structurally distinct alpha beta nicotinic p2x channels influence co-activated activation one channel type affects distinct kinetic conductance states co-activation results non-additive responses owing inhibition channel types state-dependent inhibition nicotinic channels revealed clearly mutant p2x channels inhibition decreased lower densities channel expression synaptically coupled myenteric neurons nicotinic fast excitatory postsynaptic currents occluded activation endogenously co-expressed p2x channels data provide molecular basis synaptic context cross-inhibition transmitter-gated channels
