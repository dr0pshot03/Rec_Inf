entanglement orbital angular momentum states photons
entangled quantum states separable regardless spatial separation components manifestation aspect quantum mechanics known quantum nonlocality important consequence measurement state one particle two-particle entangled state defines state second particle instantaneously whereas neither particle possesses well-defined state measurement experimental realizations entanglement hitherto restricted two-state quantum systems- involving example two orthogonal polarization states photons demonstrate entanglement involving spatial modes electromagnetic field carrying orbital angular momentum modes can used define infinitely dimensional discrete hilbert space approach provides practical route entanglement involves many orthogonal quantum states rather just two multi-dimensional entangled states considerable importance field quantum information enabling example efficient use communication channels quantum cryptography-
