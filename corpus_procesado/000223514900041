middle jurassic sphenosuchian china origin crocodylian skull 
skull living crocodylians highly solidified jaw closing muscles enlarged allowing prey capture prolonged crushing jaws living species semi-aquatic sprawling limbs broad body moves mainly side-to-side however fossils indicate evolved terrestrial forms cursorial fossils- small gracile forms often grouped together sphenosuchia fully erect slender limbs relationships however poorly understood- new crocodylomorph deposits northwestern china poorly known middle jurassic epoch possesses skull several adaptations typical living crocodylians postcranially similar sphenosuchians even greater adaptations cursoriality forelimb show phylogenetic analysis closest relative large group crocodyliformes including living crocodylians thus important features modern crocodylian skull evolved phase postcranial skeleton evolving towards greater cursoriality rather towards current semi-aquatic habitus
