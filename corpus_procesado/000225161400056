spatial patterns species distributions reveal biodiversity change 
interpretation global biodiversity change hampered lack information historical status species parts world- show declines increases can deduced current species distributions alone using spatial patterns occupancy combined distribution size declining species show sparse fragmented distributions distribution size reflecting extinction process expanding species show denser aggregated distributions reflecting colonization past distribution size changes british butterflies deduced successfully current distributions former distributions power predict future change relationship distribution pattern change british butterflies independently predicted distribution change butterfly species flanders belgium distribution change british rare plant species similarly related spatial distribution pattern link current distribution patterns processes distribution change used assess relative levels threat facing different species even regions taxa lacking detailed historical ecological information
