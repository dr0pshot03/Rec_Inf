cancer glycocalyx mechanically primes integrin-mediated growth survival
malignartcy associated altered expression glycans glycoprotems contribute cellular glycocalyx constructed glycoprotein expression signature revealed metastatic tumours upregulate expression bulky glycoproteins computational model predicted glycoproteins influence transmembrane receptor spatial organization function tested prediction investigating whether bulky glycoproteins glycocalyx promote tumour phenotype human cells increasing integrin adhesion signalling data revealed bulky glycocalyx facilitates integrin clustering funnelling active integrins adhesions altering integrin state applying tension matrix-bound integrins independent actomyosin contractility expression large tumour-associated glycoproteins non-transformed mammary cells promoted focal adhesion assembly facilitated integrin dependent growth factor signalling support cell growth survival clinical studies revealed large glycoproteins abundantly expressed circulating tumour cells patients advanced disease thus bulky glycocalyx feature tumour cells foster metastasis mechanically enhancing cell-surface receptor function
