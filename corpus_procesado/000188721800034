formation kuiper-belt binaries exchange reactions 
recent observations- revealed unexpectedly high fraction-a per cent-of trans-neptunian objects tnos inhabit kuiper belt binaries components roughly equal masses eccentric orbits wider hundred times radius primary standard theories binary asteroid formation tend produce close binaries circular orbits two models proposed explain unique characteristics tnos models however require extreme assumptions regarding size distribution tnos report mechanism capable producing binary tnos observed properties early stages formation growth required assumption tnos initially formed gravitational instabilities protoplanetary dust disk basis mechanism exchange reaction binary whose primary component much massive secondary interacts third body whose mass comparable primary low-mass secondary component ejected replaced third body wide eccentric orbit
