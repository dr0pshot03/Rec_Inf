symmetrized characterization noisy quantum processes
major goal developing high-precision control many-body quantum systems realize potential quantum computers substantial obstacle extreme fragility quantum systems decoherence environmental noise control limitations although quantum computation possible noise affecting quantum system satisfies certain conditions existing methods noise characterization intractable present multibody systems introduce technique based symmetrization enables direct experimental measurement key properties decoherence affecting quantum system method reduces number experiments required exponential polynomial number subsystems technique demonstrated optimization control nuclear spins solid state
