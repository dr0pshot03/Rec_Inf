probing quantum commutation rules addition subtraction single photons to/from light field 
possibility arbitrarily "adding" "subtracting" single photons light field may give access complete engineering quantum states fundamental quantum phenomena experimentally implemented simple alternated sequences photon creation annihilation thermal field used quantum tomography verify peculiar character resulting light states particular final states depend order two actions performed directly observed noncommutativity creation annihilation operators one cardinal concepts quantum mechanics basis quantum behavior light results represent step toward full quantum control field may provide new resources quantum information protocols
