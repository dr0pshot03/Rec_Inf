role histone h3 lysine methylation polycomb-group silencing
polycomb group pcg proteins play important roles maintaining silent state hox genes recent studies implicated histone methylation long-term gene silencing however connection pcg-mediated gene silencing histone methylation established report purification characterization eed-ezh2 complex human counterpart drosophila esc-ez complex demonstrate complex specifically methylates nucleosomal histone h3 lysine h3-k27 using chromatin immunoprecipitation assays show h3-k27 methylation colocalizes dependent ez binding ultrabithorax ubx polycomb response element pre methylation correlates ubx repression methylation h3-k27 facilitates binding polycomb pc component prc1 complex histone h3 amino-terminal tail thus studies establish link histone methylation pcg-mediated gene silencing
