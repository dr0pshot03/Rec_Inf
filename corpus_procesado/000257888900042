entangled images four-wave mixing 
two beams light can quantum mechanically entangled correlations phase intensity fluctuations pair spatially extended image carrying light fields concept entanglement can applied entire images also smaller details used spatially multimode amplifier based four wave mixing hot vapor produce twin images exhibit localized entanglement images can bright fields display position dependent quantum noise reduction intensity difference vacuum twin beams strongly entangled projected onto large range different spatial modes high degree spatial entanglement demonstrates system ideal source parallel continuous variable quantum information protocols
