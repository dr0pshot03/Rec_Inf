quasi-phase-matched generation coherent extreme-ultraviolet light 
high-harmonic generation well-known method producing coherent extreme-ultraviolet euv light photon energies kev refs achieved focusing femtosecond laser gas high harmonics fundamental laser frequency radiated forward direction however although process can generate high-energy photons efficient high-harmonic generation demonstrated photon energies order ev ref ionization gas prevents laser euv light propagating speed severely limits conversion efficiency report technique overcome problem demonstrate quasi-phase-matched frequency conversion laser light euv using modulated hollow-core waveguide periodically vary intensity laser light driving conversion efficiently generate euv light even presence substantial ionization use modulated fibre shifts energy spectrum high-harmonic light significantly higher photon energies otherwise possible expect technique form basis coherent euv sources advanced lithography high-resolution imaging applications future work might also possible generate isolated attosecond pulses
