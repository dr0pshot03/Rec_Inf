specialized forebrain circuit vocal babbling juvenile songbird 
young animals engage variable exploratory behaviors essential development neural circuitry adult motor control yet neural basis behaviors largely unknown juvenile songbirds produce subsong succession primitive vocalizations akin human babbling found subsong production zebra finches require hvc high vocal center key premotor area singing adult birds require lman lateral magnocellular nucleus nidopallium forebrain nucleus involved learning adult singing babbling neurons lman exhibited premotor correlations vocal output fast time scale thus juvenile singing driven circuit distinct produces adult behavior separation possibly general developing motor systems
