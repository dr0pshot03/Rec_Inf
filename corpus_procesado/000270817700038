electrophysiology age light 
electrophysiology gold standard investigating neuronal signalling challenged new generation optical probes together new forms microscopy probes allow us measure control neuronal signals spatial resolution genetic specificity already greatly surpass electrophysiology predict photon will progressively replace electron probing neuronal function particularly targeted stimulation silencing neuronal populations although electrophysiological characterization channels cells neural circuits will remain necessary new combinations electrophysiology imaging lead transformational discoveries neuroscience
