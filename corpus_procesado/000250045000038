phase-resolved measurements stimulated emission laser 
lasers usually described output frequency intensity however laser operation inherently nonlinear process knowledge dynamic behaviour lasers thus great importance detailed understanding laser operation improvement performance applications particular interest time domain within coherence time optical transition time determined oscillation period laser radiation thus short rigorous quantum mechanical models12 predict interesting effects like quantum beats lasing without inversion photon echo processes models based quantum coherence interference knowledge phase within optical cycle particular interest laser radiation far measured using intensity detectors sensitive square electric field therefore information sign phase laser radiation lost use electro-optic detection scheme measure amplitude phase stimulated radiation correlate radiation directly input probing pulse applied technique semiconductor quantum cascade lasers coherent sources operating frequencies optical > thz electronic < thz ranges3 addition phase information can also determine spectral gain bias dependence gain obtain insight evolution laser field
