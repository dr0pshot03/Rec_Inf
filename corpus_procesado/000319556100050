crystal structure nitrate/nitrite exchanger 
mineral nitrogen nature often found form nitrate no3- numerous microorganisms evolved assimilate nitrate use major source mineral nitrogen uptake nitrate central nitrogen metabolism first reduced nitrite no2- two-electron reduction reaction accumulation cellular nitrite can harmful nitrite can reduced cytotoxic nitric oxide instead nitrite rapidly removed cell channels transporters reduced ammonium dinitrogen action assimilatory enzymes despite decades effort structure currently available nitrate transport protein mechanism nitrate transported remains largely unknown report structure bacterial nitrate/nitrite transport protein nark escherichia coli without substrate structures reveal positively charged substrate-translocation pathway lacking protonatable residues suggesting nark functions nitrate/nitrite exchanger protons unlikely co-transported conserved arginine residues comprise substrate-binding pocket formed association helices two halves nark key residues important substrate recognition transport identified related extensive mutagenesis functional studies propose nark exchanges nitrate nitrite rocker switch mechanism facilitated inter-domain hydrogen bond networks
