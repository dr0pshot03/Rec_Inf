vertical structure recent arctic warming
near surface warming arctic almost twice large global average recent decades- phenomenon known arctic amplification underlying causes temperature amplification remain uncertain reduction snow ice cover occurred recent decades may played role climate model experiments indicate global temperature rises arctic snow ice cover retreats causing excessive polar warming- reduction snow ice cover causes albedo changes increased refreezing sea ice cold season decreases sea ice thickness increase heat flux ocean atmosphere changes oceanic atmospheric circulation well cloud cover also proposed cause arctic temperature amplification- examine vertical structure temperature change arctic late twentieth century using reanalysis data find evidence temperature amplification well surface snow ice feedbacks main cause warming aloft greater part year feedbacks expected primarily affect temperatures lowermost part atmosphere resulting pattern warming observe spring significant proportion observed temperature amplification must therefore explained mechanisms induce warming lowermost part atmosphere regress arctic temperature field atmospheric energy transport arctic find summer half year significant proportion vertical structure warming can explained changes variable conclude changes atmospheric heat transport may important cause recent arctic temperature amplification
