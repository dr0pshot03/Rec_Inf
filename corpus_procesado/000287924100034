somatic coding mutations human induced pluripotent stem cells 
defined transcription factors can induce epigenetic reprogramming adult mammalian cells induced pluripotent stem cells although dna factors integrated reprogramming methods unknown whether genome remains unchanged single nucleotide level show human induced pluripotent stem hips cell lines reprogrammed using five different methods contained average five protein-coding point mutations regions sampled estimated six protein-coding point mutations per exome majority mutations non-synonymous nonsense splice variants enriched genes mutated causative effects cancers least half reprogramming-associated mutations pre-existed fibroblast progenitors low frequencies whereas rest occurred reprogramming thus hips cells acquire genetic modifications addition epigenetic modifications extensive genetic screening become standard procedure ensure hips cell safety clinical use
