single-molecule fluorescence experiments determine protein folding transition path times
transition path tiny fraction equilibrium molecular trajectory transition occurs free-energy barrier two states crossed single-molecule property contains mechanistic information process occurs step toward observing transition paths protein folding determined average transition-path time fast slow-folding protein photon-by-photon analysis fluorescence trajectories single-molecule forster resonance energy transfer experiments whereas folding rate coefficients differ factor transition-path times differ factor less shows fast slow-folding protein take almost time fold folding actually happens simple model based energy landscape theory can explain result
