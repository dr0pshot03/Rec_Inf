experimental long-lived entanglement two macroscopic objects 
entanglement considered one profound features quantum mechanics entangled state system consisting two subsystems described product quantum states two subsystems- sense entangled system considered inseparable nonlocal generally believed entanglement usually manifest systems consisting small number microscopic particles demonstrate experimentally entanglement two macroscopic objects consisting caesium gas sample containing atoms entanglement generated via interaction samples pulse light performs non-local bell measurement collective spins samples entangled spin-state can maintained milliseconds besides fundamental interest expect robust long-lived entanglement material objects demonstrated useful quantum information processing including teleportation- quantum states matter quantum memory
