speciation sensory drive cichlid fish 
theoretically divergent selection sensory systems can cause speciation sensory drive however empirical evidence rare incomplete demonstrate sensory drive speciation within island populations cichlid fish identify ecological molecular basis divergent evolution cichlid visual system demonstrate associated divergence male colouration female preferences show subsequent differentiation neutral loci indicating reproductive isolation evidence replicated several pairs sympatric populations species variation slope environmental gradients explains variation progress towards speciation: speciation occurs steepest gradients complete demonstration far speciation sensory drive without geographical isolation results also provide mechanistic explanation collapse cichlid fish species diversity anthropogenic eutrophication lake victoria
