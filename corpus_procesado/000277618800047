narrow primary feather rachises confuciusornis archaeopteryx suggest poor flight ability 
fossil birds archaeopteryx confuciusornis feathered wings resembling living birds flight capabilities remain uncertain analysis rachises primary feathers shows rachises much thinner weaker modern birds thus birds capable flight primary feather rachises solid cross-section strongest structural configuration hollow living birds flight possible hence archaeopteryx confuciusornis flapping flyers must feather structure fundamentally different living birds alternatively gliders flapping wing stroke must appeared divergence confuciusornis likely within enantiornithine ornithurine radiations
