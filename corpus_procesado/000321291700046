spontaneous symmetry breaking important concept many branches physics helium he- breaking symmetry leads orbital chirality superfluid phase known he--a chirality fundamental property he--a direct detection challenging report direct detection chirality transport measurements electrons trapped free surface he--a particular observed so-called intrinsic magnus force experienced moving electron direction force directly reflected chirality showed superfluid transition system selected either right-or left-handed chirality observation selection directly demonstrates chiral symmetry breaking
