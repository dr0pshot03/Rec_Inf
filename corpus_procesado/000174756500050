p63 p73 required p53-dependent apoptosis response dna damage 
tumour-suppressor gene p53 frequently mutated human cancers important cellular response dna damage although p53 family members p63 p73 structurally related p53 directly linked tumour suppression although implicated apoptosis- given similarity family genes ability p63 p73 transactivate p53 target genes explore role dna damage-induced apoptosis mouse embryo fibroblasts deficient one combination p53 family members sensitized undergo apoptosis expression adenovirus e1a oncogene- using e1a system facilitated ability perform biochemical analyses also examined functions p63 p73 using vivo system apoptosis shown dependent p53 using systems show combined loss p63 p73 results failure cells containing functional p53 undergo apoptosis response dna damage
