behavioural studies indicate newly acquired motor skill rapidly consolidated initially unstable state stable state1 whereas neuroimaging studies demonstrate brain engages new regions performance task result consolidation2 however known new skill retained processed firmly consolidated early aspects motor skill acquisition involve primary motor cortex m13 nature involvement unclear tested possibility human m1 essential early motor consolidation monitored changes elementary motor behaviour subjects practised fast finger movements rapidly improved movement acceleration muscle force generation show low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation m1 brain areas specifically disrupted retention behavioural improvement affect basal motor behaviour task performance motor learning subsequent practice recall newly acquired motor skill findings indicate human m1 specifically engaged early stage motor consolidation
