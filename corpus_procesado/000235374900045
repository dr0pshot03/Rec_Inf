late quaternary atmospheric ch4 isotope record suggests marine clathrates stable 
one explanation abrupt increases atmospheric ch4 occurred repeatedly last glacial cycle involves clathrate destabalization events marine clathrates distinct deuterium/hydrogen d/h isotope ratio destabilization event cause d/h ratio atmospheric ch4 delta d-ch4 increase analyses air trapped ice second greenland ice sheet project show stable and/or decreasing delta d-ch4 values end younger older dryas periods one stadial period suggesting marine clathrates stable abrupt warming episodes elevated glacial delta d-ch4 values may result lower ratio net gross wetland ch4 emissions increase petroleum-based emissions
