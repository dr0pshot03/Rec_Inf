polyunsaturated phospholipids facilitate membrane deformation fission endocytic proteins
phospholipids pls polyunsaturated acyl chains extremely abundant specialized cellular organelles synaptic vesicles photoreceptor discs effect membrane properties poorly understood found polyunsaturated pls increased ability dynamin endophilin deform vesiculate synthetic membranes cells incorporated polyunsaturated fatty acids pls plasma membrane became amenable deformation pulling force rate endocytosis accelerated particular conditions cholesterol limiting molecular dynamics simulations biochemical measurements indicated polyunsaturated pls adapted conformation membrane curvature thus reducing energetic cost membrane bending fission polyunsaturated pls may help support rapid endocytosis
