single-cell metabolomics: analytical biological perspectives
currently much interest broad molecular profiling single cells cells metabolome-its full complement small-molecule metabolites-is direct indicator phenotypic diversity single cells nearly immediate readout cells react environmental influences however metabolome difficult measure single-cell level rapid metabolic dynamics structural diversity molecules inability amplify tag small-molecule metabolites measurement techniques including mass spectrometry capillary electrophoresis lesser extent optical spectroscopy fluorescence detection led impressive advances single-cell metabolomics even though none methodologies can currently measure metabolome single cell completely rapidly nondestructively progress sufficient field witnessing shift feasibility studies investigations yield new biological insight particularly interesting fields application cancer biology stem cell research monitoring xenobiotics drugs tissue sections single-cell level
