sterility drosophila mutations bloom syndrome gene complementation ku70 
drosophila dmblm locus homolog human bloom syndrome gene encodes helicase recq family show dmblm identical mus309 locus originally identified mutagen-sensitivity screen one mus309 allele carries stop codon two helicase motifs causes partial male sterility complete female sterility mutant males produce excess xy sperm nullo sperm consistent high frequency nondisjunction and/or chromosome loss phenotypes mus309 suggest dmblm functions dna double-strand break repair mutant dmblm phenotypes partially rescued extra copy dna repair gene ku70 indicating two genes functionally interact vivo
