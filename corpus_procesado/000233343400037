obestatin peptide encoded ghrelin gene opposes ghrelins effects food intake
ghrelin circulating appetite-inducing hormone derived prohormone posttranslational processing basis bioinformatic prediction another peptide also derived proghrelin exists isolated hormone rat stomach named obestatin-a contraction obese latin obedere meaning devour statin denoting suppression contrary appetite-stimulating effects ghrelin treatment rats obestatin suppressed food intake inhibited jejunal contraction decreased body-weight gain obestatin bound orphan g protein-coupled receptor gpr39 thus two peptide hormones opposing action weight regulation derived ghrelin gene differential modification hormones activate distinct receptors
