alkanes adopt extended conformations solution minimize steric interactions maximize surface area folding can reduce amount hydrophobic surface exposed solvent sterically unfavorable gauche interactions result however found alkyl chains two common surfactants aqueous solution adopt helical conformations bound within synthetic receptor receptor recognizes helical alkane better extended conformation even though kilocalories per mole strain introduced proper filling space burial hydrophobic surface drive molecular recognition receptor coiled alkane
