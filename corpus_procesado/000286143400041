hydrostatic pressure actomyosin cortex drive mitotic cell rounding 
mitosis adherent animal cells undergo drastic shape change essentially flat round- mitotic cell rounding thought facilitate organization within mitotic cell necessary geometric requirements division- however forces drive shape change remain poorly understood presence external impediments tissue environment use cantilevers track cell rounding force volume show cells outward rounding force increases cells enter mitosis find mitotic rounding force depends actomyosin cytoskeleton cells ability regulate osmolarity rounding force generated osmotic pressure however actomyosin cortex required maintain rounding force external impediments instantaneous disruption actomyosin cortex leads volume increase stimulation actomyosin contraction leads volume decrease results show cells osmotic pressure balanced inwardly directed actomyosin cortex contraction thus locally modulating actomyosin-cortex-dependent surface tension globally regulating osmotic pressure cells can control volume shape mechanical properties
