convergent acoustic field view echolocating bats
echolocating bats exhibit strong correlation body size frequency maximum energy echolocation calls peak frequency smaller species using signals higher frequency larger ones size-signal allometry acoustic detection constraints imposed wavelength preferred prey size used explain relationship propose hypothesis smaller bats emit higher frequencies achieve directional sonar beams variable beam width critical bats shorter wavelengths relative size emitter translate directional sound beams therefore bats emit calls mouths show relationship mouth size wavelength driving smaller bats signals higher frequency found flight room mimicking closed habitat six aerial hawking vespertilionid species ranging size g ref produced sonar beams extraordinarily similar shape volume species directivity index +/ db half-amplitude angle approximately degrees on-axis sound level +/ db sound pressure level referenced mu pa root mean square cm thus bats adapted calls achieve similar acoustic fields view propose necessity high directionality key constraint evolution echolocation explains relationship bat size echolocation call frequency results suggest echolocation dynamic system allows different species regardless body size converge optimal fields view response habitat task
