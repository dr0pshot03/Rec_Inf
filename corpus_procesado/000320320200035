cerebral asymmetry language development: cause correlate consequence
people language processed predominantly left hemisphere brain know popular view developmental language disorders result poorly lateralized brain recently evidence weak indirect modern neuroimaging methods made possible study normal abnormal development lateralized function developing brain confirmed links language literacy impairments however little evidence weak cerebral lateralization common genetic origins language literacy impairments understanding association atypical language lateralization developmental disorders may benefit reconceptualize nature cerebral asymmetry recognize multidimensionality consider variation lateralization developmental time contrary popular belief cerebral lateralization may highly heritable stable characteristic individuals rather weak lateralization may consequence impaired language learning
