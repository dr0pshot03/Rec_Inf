archipelago regulates cyclin e levels drosophila mutated human cancer cell lines 
drosophila development mammalian embryogenesis exit cell cycle contingent tightly controlled downregulation activity cyclin e-cdk2 complexes normally promote transition g1 s phase12 although protein degradation crucial role downregulating levels cyclin e many proteins function degradation cyclin e identified screen drosophila mutants display increased cell proliferation identified archipelago gene encoding protein f-box seven tandem wd tryptophan-aspartic acid repeats show archipelago mutant cells persistently elevated levels cyclin e protein without increased levels cyclin e rna under-represented g1 fractions continue proliferate wild-type neighbours become quiescent archipelago protein binds directly cyclin e probably targets ubiquitin-mediated degradation highly conserved human homologue present mutated four cancer cell lines including three ten derived ovarian carcinomas findings implicate archipelago developmentally regulated degradation cyclin e potentially pathogenesis human cancers
