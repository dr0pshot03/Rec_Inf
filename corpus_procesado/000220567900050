contextually evoked object-specific responses human visual cortex 
human visual recognition processes remarkably robust can function effectively even highly degraded viewing conditions contextual information may play critical role circumstances provide neurophysiological evidence contextual cues can elicit object-specific neural responses hitherto believed based intrinsic cues alone specifically find "fusiform face area" ffa maintains selectivity faces without regard whether faces defined intrinsically contextually finding elucidates role ffa reveals neural correlates contextual processing service robust object recognition
