systems model signaling identifies molecular basis set cytokine-induced apoptosis 
signal transduction pathways control cellular responses stimuli unclear molecular information processed network constructed systems model intracellular signaling events directly links measurements response outputs associated apoptosis model accurately predicted multiple time-dependent apoptotic responses induced combination death-inducing cytokine tumor necrosis factor prosurvival factors epidermal growth factor insulin capturing rote unsuspected autocrine circuits activated transforming growth factor-alpha interteukin- alpha model revealed new molecular mechanisms connecting signaling apoptosis model derived two groupings intracellular signals constitute fundamental dimensions molecular "basis axes" within apoptotic signaling network projection along axes captures entire measured apoptotic network suggesting cell survival determined signaling canonical basis set
