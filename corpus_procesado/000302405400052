role implications bassanite stable precursor phase gypsum precipitation
calcium sulfate minerals gypsum play important roles natural industrial processes precipitation mechanisms remain largely unexplored used time-resolved sample quenching high-resolution microscopy demonstrate gypsum forms via three-stage process: homogeneous precipitation nanocrystalline hemihydrate bassanite predicted solubility ii self-assembly bassanite elongated aggregates co-oriented along c axis iii transformation dihydrate gypsum findings indicate stable nanocrystalline precursor phase can form bulk solubility caso4 system self-assembly nanoparticles plays crucial role understanding bassanite forms prior gypsum can lead efficient anti-scaling strategies water desalination may help explain persistence caso4 phases regions low water activity mars
