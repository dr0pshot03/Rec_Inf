first stars universe cosmic reionization 
earliest generation stars far mere novelty transformed universe darkness light first atoms form big bang filled universe atomic hydrogen light elements gravity pulled gas clouds together first stars ignited radiation turned surrounding atoms ions looking gas us distant galaxies know ionization eventually pervaded space hydrogen atoms remain today galaxies knowing exactly primary goal cosmologists tell us early stars formed kinds galaxies although ionization beginning understood using theoretical models computer simulations new generation telescopes built will map atomic hydrogen throughout universe
