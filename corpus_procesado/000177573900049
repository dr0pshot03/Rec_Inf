requirement caspase stress-induced apoptosis mitochondrial permeabilization 
current view cytotoxic stress dna damage induces apoptosis regulating permeability mitochondria mitochondria sequester several proteins released kill activating caspases proteases disassemble cell cytokines activate caspases different way assembling receptor complexes activate caspases directly case subsequent mitochondrial permeabilization accelerates cell disassembly amplifying caspase activity found cytotoxic stress causes activation caspase- caspase required permeabilization mitochondria therefore argue cytokine-induced stress-induced apoptosis act conceptually similar pathways mitochondria amplifiers caspase activity rather initiators caspase activation
