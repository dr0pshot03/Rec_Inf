amyloid-beta dynamics regulated orexin sleep-wake cycle 
amyloid-beta beta accumulation brain extracellular space hallmark alzheimers disease factors regulating process partly understood beta aggregation concentration-dependent process likely responsive changes brain interstitial fluid isf levels beta using vivo microdialysis mice found amount isf beta correlated wakefulness amount isf beta also significantly increased acute sleep deprivation orexin infusion decreased infusion dual orexin receptor antagonist chronic sleep restriction significantly increased dual orexin receptor antagonist decreased beta plaque formation amyloid precursor protein transgenic mice thus sleep-wake cycle orexin may play role pathogenesis alzheimers disease
