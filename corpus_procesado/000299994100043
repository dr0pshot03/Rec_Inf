gated regulation crac channel ion selectivity stim1
two defining functional features ion channels ion selectivity channel gating ion selectivity generally considered immutable property open channel structure whereas gating involves transitions open closed channel states typically without changes ion selectivity store-operated ca2+ release-activated ca2+ crac channels molecular mechanism channel gating crac channel activator stromal interaction molecule stim1 remains unknown crac channels distinguished high ca2+ selectivity instrumental generating sustained intracellular calcium concentration elevations necessary gene expression effector function many eukaryotic cells probe central features stim1 gating mechanism human crac channel protein orai1 identify v102 residue located extracellular region pore candidate channel gate mutations v102 produce constitutively active crac channels open even absence stim1 unexpectedly although stim1-free v102 mutant channels ca2+-selective ca2+ selectivity dose-dependently boosted interactions stim1 similar enhancement ca2+ selectivity also seen wild-type orai1 channels increasing number stim1 activation domains directly tethered orai1 channels increasing relative expression full-length stim1 thus exquisite ca2+ selectivity intrinsic property crac channels rather tuneable feature bestowed otherwise non-selective orai1 channels stim1 results demonstrate stim1-mediated gating crac channels occurs unusual mechanism permeation gating closely coupled
