target neuron prespecification olfactory map drosophila 
drosophila mice olfactory receptor neurons orns expressing receptors convergent axonal projections specific glomerular targets antennal lobe/olfactory bulb creating odour map first olfactory structure central nervous system- projection neurons drosophila antennal lobe send dendrites glomeruli axons higher brain centres thereby transferring odour map brain use marcm method perform systematic clonal analysis projection neurons allowing us correlate lineage birth time projection neurons glomerular choice demonstrate projection neurons prespecified lineage birth order form synapse specific incoming orn axons therefore carry specific olfactory information prespecification used hardwire flys olfactory system enabling stereotyped behavioural responses odorants developmental studies lead us hypothesize recognition molecules ensure reciprocally specific connections orns projection neurons studies also imply previously unanticipated role precise dendritic targeting postsynaptic neurons determining connection specificity
