heme export protein required red blood cell differentiation iron homeostasis
hemoproteins critical function integrity aerobic cells however free heme toxic therefore cells must balance heme synthesis use previously demonstrated feline leukemia virus subgroup c receptor flvcr exports cytoplasmic heme show flvcr null mice lack definitive erythropoiesis craniofacial limb deformities resembling patients diamond blackfan anemia die midgestation mice flvcr deleted neonatally develop severe macrocytic anemia proerythroblast maturation arrest suggests erythroid precursors export excess heme ensure survival demonstrate flvcr mediates heme export macrophages ingest senescent red cells regulates hepatic iron thus trafficking heme just elemental iron facilitates erythropoiesis systemic iron balance
