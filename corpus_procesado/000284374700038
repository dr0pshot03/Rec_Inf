loss carbon deep sea since last glacial maximum 
deep-ocean carbonate ion concentrations [co32-] carbon isotopic ratios delta13c place important constraints past redistributions carbon ocean-land-atmosphere system hence provide clues causes atmospheric co2 concentration changes however existing deep-sea [co32-] reconstructions conflict one another complicating paleoceanographic interpretations present deep-sea [co32-] five cores three major oceans quantified using benthic foraminiferal boron/calcium ratios since last glacial period combined benthic delta13c [co32-] results indicate deep-sea-released co2 early deglacial period thousand years ago preferentially stored atmosphere whereas late deglacial period thousand years ago besides contributing contemporary atmospheric co2 rise substantial portion co2 released oceans absorbed terrestrial biosphere
