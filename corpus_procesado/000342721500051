sister kinetochores mechanically fused meiosis yeast
production healthy gametes requires reductional meiosis division replicated sister chromatids comigrate rather separate mitosis meiosis ii fusion sister kinetochores meiosis may underlie sister chromatid comigration diverse organisms direct evidence fusion lacking used laser trapping quantitative fluorescence microscopy study native kinetochore particles isolated yeast meiosis kinetochores formed stronger attachments carried microtubule-binding elements kinetochores isolated cells mitosis meiosis ii meiosis i-specific monopolin complex necessary sufficient drive modifications thus kinetochore fusion directs sister chromatid comigration conserved feature meiosis fundamental mendelian inheritance
