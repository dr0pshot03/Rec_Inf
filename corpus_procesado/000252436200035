coastal ecosystem-based management nonlinear ecological functions values
common assumption ecosystem services respond linearly changes habitat size assumption leads frequently none choice either preserving coastal habitats converting human use however survey wave attenuation data field studies mangroves salt marshes seagrass beds nearshore coral reefs sand dunes reveals relationships rarely linear incorporating nonlinear wave attenuation estimating coastal protection values mangroves thailand show optimal land use option may instead integration development conservation consistent ecosystem based management goals result suggests reconciling competing demands coastal habitats always result stark preservation versus conversion choices
