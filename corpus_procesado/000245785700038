regioselective one-pot protection carbohydrates
carbohydrates involved wide range biological processes- structurally diverse compounds complex biological polymers often present heterogeneous mixtures nature chemical synthesis carbohydrates one way obtain pure oligosaccharides hampered difficulties associated regioselective protection polyhydroxyls challenges related stereoselective assembly glycosidic linkages- describe combinatorial highly-regioselective method can used protect individual hydroxy groups monosaccharide approach can used install orthogonal protecting group pattern single reaction vessel one-pot reaction removes need carry time-consuming isolation purification intermediates hundreds building blocks efficiently prepared starting d-glucose iterative coupling building blocks enabled us assemble beta--glucans library oligosaccharides based influenza-virus binding trisaccharide
