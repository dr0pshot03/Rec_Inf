stable prenucleation calcium carbonate clusters
calcium carbonate forms scales geological deposits biominerals ocean sediments huge amounts carbon dioxide retained carbonate ions calcium ions represent major contribution water hardness despite relevance little known precipitation mechanism calcium carbonate specified complex crystal structures challenge classical view nucleation considering formation metastable ion clusters demonstrate dissolved calcium carbonate fact contains stable prenucleation ion clusters forming even undersaturated solution cluster formation can characterized means equilibrium thermodynamics applying multiple binding model allows structural preformation stable clusters relevant species calcium carbonate nucleation mechanisms may also important crystallization minerals
