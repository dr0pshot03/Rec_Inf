environment-induced sudden death entanglement
demonstrate difference local single-particle dynamics global dynamics entangled quantum systems coupled independent environments using all-optical experimental setup showed even environment-induced decay system asymptotic quantum entanglement may suddenly disappear sudden death constitutes yet another distinct counterintuitive trait entanglement
