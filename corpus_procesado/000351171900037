ligand-enabled meta-c-h activation using transient mediator
achieving site selectivity c-h functionalization reactions significant challenge especially target c-h bond distant existing functional groups- coordination functional group metal often key driving force control element many important reactions including asymmetric hydrogenation epoxidation lithiation exploitation effect led development broad range directed c-h activation reactions- however c-h activation methods limited proximal c-h bonds spatially geometrically accessible directing functional group development meta-selective c-h functionalizations remains significant challenges-- recently developed u-shaped template can used overcome constraint shown can used selectively activate remote meta-c-h bonds although approach proved applicable various substrates catalytic transformations- need covalently attached complex template substantial drawback synthetic applications report alternative approach employing norbornene transient mediator achieve meta-selective c-h activation simple common orthodirecting group use newly developed pyridine-based ligand crucial relaying palladium catalyst meta position norbornene initial ortho-c-h activation catalytic reaction demonstrates feasibility switching ortho-selectivity metaselectivity c-h activation substrate catalyst control
