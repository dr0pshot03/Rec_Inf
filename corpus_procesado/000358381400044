phosphatidylserine transport orp/osh proteins driven phosphatidylinositol phosphate 
eukaryotic cells phosphatidylserine ps synthesized endoplasmic reticulum er highly enriched plasma membrane pm contributes negative charge specific recruitment signaling proteins distribution relies transport mechanisms whose nature remains elusive found ps transporter osh6p extracted phosphatidylinositol phosphate pi4p exchanged ps pi4p two membranes solved crystal structure osh6p: pi4p complex demonstrated transport ps osh6p depends pi4p recognition vivo finally showed pi4p-phosphatase sac1p maintaining pi4p gradient er/pm interface drove ps transport thus ps transport oxysterol-binding protein-related protein orp/oxysterol-binding homology osh proteins fueled pi4p metabolism ps/pi4p exchange cycles
