neural palmitoyl-proteomics reveals dynamic synaptic palmitoylation 
palmitoylation regulates diverse aspects neuronal protein trafficking function global characterization rat neural palmitoyl proteomes identifies known neural palmitoyl proteins total plus new palmitoyl protein candidates testing confirming palmitoylation candidates new palmitoyl proteins include neurotransmitter receptors transporters adhesion molecules scaffolding proteins well snares vesicular trafficking proteins particular interest finding palmitoylation brain specific cdc42 splice variant palmitoylated cdc42 isoform cdc42 palm differs canonical prenylated form cdc42 prenyl regard localization function: cdc42 palm concentrates dendritic spines special role inducing post synaptic structures furthermore assessing palmitoylation dynamics drug induced activity models identifies rapidly induced changes cdc42 well synaptic palmitoyl proteins suggesting palmitoylation may participate broadly activity driven changes shape synapse morphology function
