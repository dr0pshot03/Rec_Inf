carbon nanotube arrays strong shear binding-on easy normal lifting-off 
ability gecko lizards adhere vertical solid surface comes remarkable feet aligned microscopic elastic hairs using carbon nanotube arrays dominated straight body segment curly entangled top created gecko-foot-mimetic dry adhesives show macroscopic adhesive forces similar newtons per square centimeter almost times gecko foot much stronger shear adhesion force normal adhesion force ensure strong binding along shear direction easy lifting normal direction anisotropic force distribution due shear-induced alignments curly segments nanotubes mimetic adhesives can alternatively binding-on lifting-off various substrates simulating walking living gecko
