redox rhythm reinforces circadian clock gate immune response 
recent studies shown addition transcriptional circadian clock many organisms including arabidopsis circadian redox rhythm driven organisms metabolic activities1- hypothesized redox rhythm linked circadian clock mechanism biological significance link begun investigated4- report master immune regulator npr1 non-expressor pathogenesis-related gene arabidopsis sensor plants redox state regulates transcription core circadian clock genes even absence pathogen challenge surprisingly acute perturbation redox status triggered immune signal salicylic acid compromise circadian clock rather leads reinforcement mathematical modelling subsequent experiments show npr1 reinforces circadian clock without changing period regulating morning evening clock genes balanced network architecture helps plants gate immune responses towards morning minimize costs growth night study demonstrates sensitive redox rhythm interacts robust circadian clock ensure proper responsiveness environmental stimuli without compromising fitness organism
