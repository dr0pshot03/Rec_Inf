among key properties distinguish adult mammalian stem cells differentiated progeny ability stem cells remain quiescent state prolonged periods time however molecular pathways maintenance stem-cell quiescence remain elusive use adult mouse muscle stem cells satellite cells model system show microrna mirna pathway essential maintenance quiescent state satellite cells lack functional mirna pathway spontaneously exit quiescence enter cell cycle identified quiescence-specific mirnas satellite-cell lineage microarray analysis among mirna mir- highly expressed quiescent satellite cells quickly downregulated satellite-cell activation analysis revealed mir functions regulator satellite-cell quiescence post-transcriptionally suppresses oncogene dek protein product localizes differentiated daughter cell asymmetric division satellite cells promotes transient proliferative expansion myogenic progenitors results provide evidence mirna pathway general specific mirna mir- actively maintaining quiescent state adult stem-cell population
