translational tuning optimizes nascent protein folding cells
cells biosynthetic machinery coordinates protein synthesis folding optimize efficiency minimize off-pathway outcomes however difficult delineate experimentally mechanisms responsible using fluorescence resonance energy transfer studied cotranslational folding first nucleotide-binding domain cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator synthesis folding occurred discretely via sequential compaction n-terminal alpha-helical alpha/beta-core subdomains moreover timing events critical premature alpha-subdomain folding prevented subsequent core formation process facilitated modulating intrinsic folding propensity three distinct ways: delaying alpha-subdomain compaction facilitating b-strand intercalation optimizing translation kinetics via codon usage thus de novo folding translationally tuned integrated cellular response shapes cotranslational folding landscape critical stages synthesis
