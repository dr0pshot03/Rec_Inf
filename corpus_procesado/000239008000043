bacterial virulence protein suppresses host innate immunity cause plant disease
plants evolved powerful immune system defend infection microbial organisms however successful pathogens pseudomonas syringae developed countermeasures inject virulence proteins host plant cell suppress immunity cause devastating diseases despite intensive research efforts molecular targets bacterial virulence proteins important plant disease development remained obscure show conserved p syringae virulence protein hopm1 targets immunity-associated protein atmin7 arabidopsis thaliana hopm1 mediates destruction atmin7 via host proteasome results illustrate strategy bacterial pathogen exploits host proteasome subvert host immunity causes infection plants
