epigenetic modifications histone level affect gene regulation response extracellular signals however regulated epigenetic modifications dna level especially active dna demethylation gene activation well understood- report dna methylation/demethylation hormonally switched control transcription cytochrome p450 27b1 cyp27b1 gene reflecting vitamin-d-mediated transrepression cyp27b1 gene negative vitamin d response element nvdre methylation cpg sites 5mcpg induced vitamin d gene promoter conversely treatment parathyroid hormone hormone known activate cyp27b1 gene induces active demethylation 5mcpg sites promoter biochemical purification complex associated nvdre-binding protein vdir also known tcf3 identified two dna methyl-transferases dnmt1 dnmt3b methylation cpg sites well dna glycosylase mbd4 ref protein-kinase-c-phosphorylated mbd4 parathyroid hormone stimulation promotes incision methylated dna glycosylase activity base-excision repair process seems complete dna demethylation mbd4-bound promoter parathyroid-hormone induced dna demethylation subsequent transcriptional derepression impaired mbd4-/- mice thus present findings suggest methylation switching dna level contributes hormonal control transcription
