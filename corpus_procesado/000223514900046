argos inhibits epidermal growth factor receptor signalling ligand sequestration
epidermal growth factor receptor egfr critical functions development many human cancers- development spatial extent egfr signalling regulated feedback loops comprising well-understood activators less well-characterized inhibitors drosophila melanogaster secreted protein argos functions known extracellular inhibitor egfr clearly identified roles multiple stages development argos expressed drosophila egfr der activated high levels downregulates der signalling although ample genetic evidence argos inhibits der activation biochemical mechanism established show argos inhibits der signalling without interacting directly receptor instead sequestering der-activating ligand spitz argos binds tightly egf motif spitz forms : spitz: argos complex bind der vitro cell surface results provide insight mechanism argos function suggest new strategies egfr inhibitor design
