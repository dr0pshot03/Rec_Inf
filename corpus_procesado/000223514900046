argos inhibits epidermal growth factor receptor signalling ligand sequestration 
epidermal growth factor receptor egfr critical functions development many human cancers1- development spatial extent egfr signalling regulated feedback loops comprising well-understood activators less well-characterized inhibitors34 drosophila melanogaster secreted protein argos functions known extracellular inhibitor egfr5 clearly identified roles multiple stages development3 argos expressed drosophila egfr der activated high levels6 downregulates der signalling although ample genetic evidence argos inhibits der activation biochemical mechanism established show argos inhibits der signalling without interacting directly receptor instead sequestering der-activating ligand spitz argos binds tightly egf motif spitz forms : spitz: argos complex bind der vitro cell surface results provide insight mechanism argos function suggest new strategies egfr inhibitor design
