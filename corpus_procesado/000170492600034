ring closure carbon nanotubes
lightly etched single-waited carbon nanotubes chemically reacted form rings rings appear fully closed opposed open coils ring-opening reactions change structure observed rings average diameter rings nanometers narrow size distribution nanotubes solution modeled wormlike polymer chains yielding persistence length nanometers nanotubes shorter length behave stiffly stay nearly straight solution however nanotubes longer kuhn segment length nanometers undergo considerable thermal fluctuation suggesting greater flexibility materials generally assumed
