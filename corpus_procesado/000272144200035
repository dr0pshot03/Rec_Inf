structure formate transporter foca reveals pentameric aquaporin-like channel 
foca representative member formate-nitrite transporter family transports short-chain acids bacteria archaea fungi algae parasites structure transport mechanism formate-nitrite transporter family remain unknown report crystal structure escherichia coli foca angstrom resolution foca forms symmetric pentamer protomer consisting six transmembrane segments despite lack sequence homology overall structure foca protomer closely resembles aquaporin strongly argues foca channel rather transporter structural analysis identifies potentially important channel residues defines channel path reveals two constriction sites unlike aquaporin foca impermeable water allows passage formate structural biochemical investigation provides mechanistic insights channel activity foca
