avalon explosion: evolution ediacara morphospace
ediacara fossils [ million years ago ma] represent earths oldest known complex macroscopic life forms morphological history poorly understood comprehensive quantitative analysis fossils indicates oldest ediacara assemblage avalon assemblage ma already encompassed full range ediacara morphospace comparable morphospace range occupied subsequent white sea ma nama ma assemblages although populated differently contrast taxonomic richness increased white sea assemblage declined nama assemblage diversity changes occurring morphospace range remained relatively constant led inverse shifts morphological variance avalon morphospace expansion mirrors cambrian explosion events may reflect similar underlying mechanisms
