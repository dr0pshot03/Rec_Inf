motile cilia human airway epithelia chemosensory 
cilia microscopic projections extend eukaryotic cells two general types cilia primary cilia serve sensory organelles whereas motile cilia exert mechanical force motile cilia emerging human airway epithelial cells propel harmful inhaled material lung found cells express sensory bitter taste receptors localized motile cilia bitter compounds increased intracellular calcium ion concentration stimulated ciliary beat frequency thus airway epithelia contain cell-autonomous system motile cilia sense noxious substances entering airways initiate defensive mechanical mechanism eliminate offending compound hence like primary cilia classical motile cilia also contain sensors detect external environment
