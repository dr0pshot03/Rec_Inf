th cell differentiation regulated circadian clock
circadian clocks regulate numerous physiological processes vary across day-night diurnal cycle circadian clock regulates adaptive immune system mostly unclear interleukin--producing cd4+ t helper th cells proinflammatory immune cells protect bacterial fungal infections mucosal surfaces lineage specification regulated orphan nuclear receptor ror gamma t show transcription factor nfil3 suppresses th cell development directly binding repressing ror gamma t promoter nfil3 links th cell development circadian clock network transcription factor rev-erb alpha accordingly th lineage specification varies diurnally altered rev-erba-/- mice light-cycle disruption elevated intestinal th cell frequencies increased susceptibility inflammatory disease thus lineage specification key immune cell direct circadian control
