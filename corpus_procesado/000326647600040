th17 cell differentiation regulated circadian clock 
circadian clocks regulate numerous physiological processes vary across day-night diurnal cycle circadian clock regulates adaptive immune system mostly unclear interleukin--producing cd4+ t helper th17 cells proinflammatory immune cells protect bacterial fungal infections mucosal surfaces lineage specification regulated orphan nuclear receptor ror gamma t show transcription factor nfil3 suppresses th17 cell development directly binding repressing ror gamma t promoter nfil3 links th17 cell development circadian clock network transcription factor rev-erb alpha accordingly th17 lineage specification varies diurnally altered rev-erba-/- mice light-cycle disruption elevated intestinal th17 cell frequencies increased susceptibility inflammatory disease thus lineage specification key immune cell direct circadian control
