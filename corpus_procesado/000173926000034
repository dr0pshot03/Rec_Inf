protonic diffusion high-pressure ice vii 
near ambient pressures molecular diffusion dominates protonic diffusion ice theoretical studies predicted protonic diffusion will dominate high pressures ice measured protonic diffusion coefficient highest temperature molecular phase ice vii kelvin entire stable pressure region values ranged - - square meters per second pressures gigapascals diffusion coefficients extrapolated high temperatures close ice vii melting curve less factor superionic criterion similar to10- square meters per second protons diffuse freely
