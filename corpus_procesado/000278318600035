meiotic recombination provokes functional activation p53 regulatory network 
evolutionary appearance p53 protein probably preceded role tumor suppression suggesting may unappreciated functions protein using genetic reporters proxies follow vivo activation p53 network drosophila discovered process meiotic recombination instigates programmed activation p53 germ line specifically double-stranded breaks dna generated topoisomerase spo11 provoked functional p53 activity prolonged cells defective meiotic dna repair intrinsic stimulus p53 regulatory network highly conserved spo11-dependent activation p53 also occurs mice findings establish physiological role p53 meiosis suggest tumor-suppressive functions may co-opted primordial activities linked recombination
