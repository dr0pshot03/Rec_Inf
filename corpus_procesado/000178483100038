indistinguishable photons single-photon device 
single-photon sources recently demonstrated using variety devices including molecules- mesoscopic quantum wells colour centres trapped ions semiconductor quantum dots- compared poisson-distributed source intensity sources rarely emit two photons pulse numerous applications single-photon sources proposed field quantum information most-including linear-optical quantum computation-also require consecutive photons identical wave packets source based single quantum emitter emitter must therefore excited rapid deterministic way interact little surrounding environment test indistinguishability photons emitted semiconductor quantum dot microcavity hong-ou-mandel-type two-photon interference experiment find consecutive photons largely indistinguishable mean wave-packet overlap large making source useful variety experiments quantum optics quantum information
