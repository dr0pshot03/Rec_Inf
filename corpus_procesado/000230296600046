generation time temporal scaling bird population dynamics
theoretical studies shown variation density regulation strongly influences population dynamics yet understanding factors influencing strength density dependence natural populations still limited consequently general hypotheses advanced explain large differences species magnitude population fluctuations- one reason detection density regulation population time series complicated time lags induced life history species make difficult separate relative contributions intrinsic extrinsic factors population dynamics use population time series bird species estimate parameters stochastic density-dependent age-structured model show strength total density dependence life history magnitude environmental stochasticity including transient fluctuations age structure increase generation time results indicate relationships demographic life-history traits birds translate distinct population dynamical patterns apparent scale generations
