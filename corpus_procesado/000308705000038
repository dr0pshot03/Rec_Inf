bond-order discrimination atomic force microscopy 
show different bond orders individual carbon-carbon bonds polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons fullerenes can distinguished noncontact atomic force microscopy afm carbon monoxide co-functionalized tip found two different contrast mechanisms corroborated density functional theory calculations: greater electron density bonds higher bond order led stronger pauli repulsion enhanced brightness bonds high-resolution afm images apparent bond length afm images decreased increasing bond order tilting co molecule tip apex
