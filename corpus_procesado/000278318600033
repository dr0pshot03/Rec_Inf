permissive secondary mutations enable evolution influenza oseltamivir resistance
his-> tyr h274y mutation confers oseltamivir resistance n1 influenza neuraminidase long thought compromise viral fitness however beginning viruses containing h274y rapidly became predominant among human seasonal h1n1 isolates show h274y decreases amount neuraminidase reaches cell surface defect can counteracted secondary mutations also restore viral fitness two mutations occurred seasonal h1n1 shortly widespread appearance h274y evolution oseltamivir resistance therefore enabled permissive mutations allowed virus tolerate subsequent occurrences h274y understanding process may provide basis predicting evolution oseltamivir resistance influenza strains
