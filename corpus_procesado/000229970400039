stargazin modulates ampa receptor gating trafficking distinct domains 
ampa alpha-amino--hydroxy--methyl--isoxazole propionic acid receptors mediate fast excitatory synaptic transmission brain ion channels rapidly deactivate desensitize determine time course synaptic transmission find ampa receptor interacting protein stargazin mediates ampa receptor trafficking also shapes synaptic responses slowing channel deactivation desensitization cytoplasmic tail stargazin determines receptor trafficking whereas ectodomain controls channel properties stargazin alters ampa receptor kinetics increasing rate channel opening disrupting interaction stargazin ectodomain hippocampal ampa receptors alters amplitude shape synaptic responses establishing crucial function stargazin controlling efficacy synaptic transmission brain
