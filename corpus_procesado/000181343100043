regulated degradation class v myosin receptor directs movement yeast vacuole
normal cellular function requires organelles positioned specific locations direction molecular motors move organelles based part polarity microtubules actin filaments- however alone determine intracellular destination organelles example yeast class v myosin myo2p moves several organelles distinct locations cell cycle- thus movement type myo2p cargo must regulated uniquely report regulatory mechanism specifically provides directionality vacuole movement vacuole-specific myo2p receptor vac17p key function process vac17p binds simultaneously myo2p vac8p vacuolar membrane protein transport complex myo2p-vac17p-vac8p moves vacuole bud disrupted degradation vac17p vacuole ultimately deposited near centre bud removal pest sequence potential signal rapid protein degradation within vac17p causes stabilization subsequent backward movement vacuoles mistargets neck mother cell bud thus regulated disruption transport complex places vacuole proper location may general mechanism whereby organelles deposited terminal destination
