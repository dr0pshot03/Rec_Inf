antagonistic coevolution accelerates molecular evolution
red queen hypothesis proposes coevolution interacting species hosts parasites drive molecular evolution continual natural selection adaptation counter-adaptation- although divergence observed host-resistance- parasite-infectivity- genes consistent long time periods typically required study coevolution far prevented direct empirical test show using experimental populations bacterium pseudomonas fluorescens sbw25 viral parasite phage phi refs rate molecular evolution phage far higher bacterium phage coevolved phage evolved constant host genotype coevolution also resulted far greater genetic divergence replicate populations correlated range hosts coevolved phage able infect consistent rapidly evolving phage genes coevolution involved host infection results demonstrate genomic phenotypic level antagonistic coevolution cause rapid divergent evolution likely major driver evolutionary change within species
