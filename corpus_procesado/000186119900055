lysm domain receptor kinases regulating rhizobial nod factor-induced infection 
rhizobial infection legumes stringent demand toward nod factor structure host responses therefore specific nod factor entry receptor proposed sym2 gene identfied certain ecotypes pea pisum sativum good candidate entry receptor exploited close phylogenetic relationship pea model legume medicago truncatula identify genes specifically involved rhizobial infection sym2 orthologous region m truncatula contains putative receptor-like genes lysm domain-containing receptor-like kinases lyks using reverse genetics m truncatula show two lyk genes specifically involved infection thread formation well properties lysm domains strongly suggests nod factor entry receptors
