autophagy-dependent anticancer immune responses induced chemotherapeutic agents mice 
antineoplastic chemotherapies particularly efficient elicit immunogenic cell death thus provoking anticancer immune response demonstrate autophagy often disabled cancer dispensable chemotherapy-induced cell death required immunogenicity response chemotherapy autophagy-competent autophagy-deficient cancers attracted dendritic cells t lymphocytes tumor bed suppression autophagy inhibited release adenosine triphosphate atp dying tumor cells conversely inhibition extracellular atp-degrading enzymes increased pericellular atp autophagy-deficient tumors reestablished recruitment immune cells restored chemotherapeutic responses immunocompetent hosts thus autophagy essential immunogenic release atp dying cells increased extracellular atp concentrations improve efficacy antineoplastic chemotherapies autophagy disabled
