pause sequence enriched translation start sites drives transcription dynamics vivo 
transcription rna polymerase rnap interrupted pauses play diverse regulatory roles although individual pauses studied vitro determinants pauses vivo distribution throughout bacterial genome remain unknown using nascent transcript sequencing identified -nucleotide consensus pause sequence escherichia coli accounts known regulatory pause sites well similar new vivo pause sites vitro single-molecule ensemble analyses demonstrate pauses result rnap-nucleic acid interactions inhibit next-nucleotide addition consensus sequence also leads pausing rnaps diverse lineages enriched translation start sites e coli bacillus subtilis results thus reveal conserved mechanism unifying known newly identified pause events
