nuclear receptor rev-erb alpha controls circadian thermogenic plasticity 
circadian oscillation body temperature basic evolutionarily conserved feature mammalian biology addition homeostatic pathways allow organisms protect core temperatures response cold exposure however mechanism responsible coordinating daily body temperature rhythm adaptability environmental challenges unknown show nuclear receptor rev-erb alpha also known nr1d1 powerful transcriptional repressor links circadian thermogenic networks regulation brown adipose tissue bat function mice exposed cold fare considerably better : zeitgeber time rev-erb alpha barely expressed : zeitgeber time rev-erb alpha abundant deletion rev-erb alpha markedly improves cold tolerance : indicating overcoming rev-erb alpha-dependent repression fundamental feature thermogenic response cold physiological induction uncoupling protein ucp1 cold temperatures preceded rapid downregulation rev-erb alpha bat rev-erb alpha represses ucp1 brown-adipose-cell-autonomous manner bat ucp1 levels high rev-erb alpha-null mice even thermoneutrality genetic loss rev-erb alpha also abolishes normal rhythms body temperature bat activity thus rev-erb alpha acts thermogenic focal point required establishing maintaining body temperature rhythm manner adaptable environmental demands
