mass disruption oort cloud comets
calculated number dormant nearly isotropic oort cloud comets solar system combining orbital distribution models statistical models dormant comet discoveries well-defined surveys ii comparing model results observations population dormant comets dynamical models assume comets destroyed predict discovered similar to100 times dormant nearly isotropic comets actually seen thus comets evolve inward oort cloud majority must physically disrupt
