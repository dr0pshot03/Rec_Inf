structural origin slow diffusion protein folding
experimental theoretical computational studies small proteins suggest interresidue contacts present folded structure play little role self-assembly mechanism non-native contacts can however influence folding kinetics introducing additional local minima slow diffusion global free-energy barrier folded unfolded states combine single-molecule fluorescence all-atom molecular dynamics simulations discover structural origin slow diffusion markedly decreases folding rate designed a-helical protein experimental determination transition path times analysis simulations point non-native salt bridges helices source provides quantitative glimpse specific intramolecular interactions influence protein folding rates altering dynamics activation free energies
