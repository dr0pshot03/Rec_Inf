ratchet-like inter-subunit reorganization ribosome translocation 
ribosome macromolecular assembly responsible protein biosynthesis following genetic instructions organisms composed two unequal subunits: smaller subunit binds messenger rna anticodon end transfer rnas helps decode mrna; larger subunit interacts amino-acid-carrying end trnas catalyses formation peptide bonds peptide-bond formation elongation factor g ef-g binds ribosome triggering translocation peptidyl-trna aminoacyl site peptidyl site movement mrna one codon1 analyse three-dimensional cryo-electron microscopy maps escherichia coli 70s ribosome various functional states show ef-g binding subsequent gtp hydrolysis lead ratchet-like rotations small 30s subunit relative large 50s subunit furthermore finding indicates two-step mechanism translocation: first relative rotation subunits opening mrna channel following binding gtp ef-g; second advance mrna/trna2 complex direction rotation 30s subunit following gtp hydrolysis
