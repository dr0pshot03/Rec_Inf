array possibilities study autoimmunity
since completion sequencing human genome scientific focus shifted studying genes analysing much larger number proteins encoded several proteins can generated single gene depending genetic information read transcribed resultant protein modified following translation post-translational modification genomic proteomic technologies already providing useful information autoimmune disease likely lead important discoveries within next decade
