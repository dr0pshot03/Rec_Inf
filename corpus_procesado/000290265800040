saturns curiously corrugated c ring
august sun illuminated saturns rings almost exactly edge-on revealing subtle corrugation extends across entire c ring corrugations amplitude meters wavelength kilometers radial trends corrugations wavelength indicate structure-like similar corrugation previously identified d ring-results differential nodal regression within ring became tilted relative saturns equator plane suggest initial tilt arose interplanetary debris struck rings corrugations radial extent implies impacting material dispersed cloud debris instead single object corrugations amplitude indicates debris total mass similar kilograms
