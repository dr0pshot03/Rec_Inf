non-transcriptional control dna replication c-myc
c-myc proto-oncogene encodes transcription factor essential cell growth proliferation broadly implicated tumorigenesis however biological functions required c-myc induce oncogenesis remain elusive show c-myc direct role control dna replication c-myc interacts pre-replicative complex localizes early sites dna synthesis depletion c-myc mammalian human mouse cells well xenopus cell-free extracts devoid rna transcription demonstrates non-transcriptional role c-myc initiation dna replication overexpression c-myc causes increased replication origin activity subsequent dna damage checkpoint activation findings identify critical function c-myc dna replication suggest novel mechanism normal oncogenic functions
