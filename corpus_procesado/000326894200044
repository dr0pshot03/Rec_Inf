rna catalyses nuclear pre-mrna splicing 
nuclear pre-messenger rna splicing introns excised spliceosome dynamic machine composed proteins small nuclear rnas snrnas thirty years ago discovery self-splicing group ii intron rnas snrnas proposed catalyse splicing however definitive evidence role either rna protein catalysis spliceosome reported far using metal rescue strategies spliceosomes budding yeast show u6 snrna catalyses two splicing reactions positioning divalent metals stabilize leaving groups reaction notably u6 catalytic metal ligands identified correspond ligands observed position catalytic divalent metals crystal structures group ii intron rna findings indicate group ii introns spliceosome share common catalytic mechanisms probably common evolutionary origins results demonstrate rna mediates catalysis within spliceosome
