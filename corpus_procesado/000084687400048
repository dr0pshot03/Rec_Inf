reduced vas deferens contraction male infertility mice lacking p2x1 receptors 
p2x1 receptors atp ligand-gated cation channels present many excitable cells including vas deferens smooth muscle cells1- substantial component contractile response vas deferens sympathetic nerve stimulation propels sperm ejaculate mediated p2x receptors show male fertility reduced similar % mice targeted deletion p2x1 receptor gene male mice copulate normally-reduced fertility results reduction sperm ejaculate sperm dysfunction female mice heterozygote mice unaffected p2x1-receptor-deficient mice contraction vas deferens sympathetic nerve stimulation reduced % responses p2x receptor agonists abolished results show p2x1 receptors essential normal male reproductive function suggest development selective p2x1 receptor antagonists may provide effective non-hormonal male contraceptive pill also agents potentiate actions atp p2x1 receptors may useful treatment male infertility
