retinal repair transplantation photoreceptor precursors
photoreceptor loss causes irreversible blindness many retinal diseases repair damage cell transplantation one feasible types central nervous system repair photoreceptor degeneration initially leaves inner retinal circuitry intact new photoreceptors need make single short synaptic connections contribute retinotopic map far brain retina-derived stem cells transplanted adult retina shown little evidence able integrate outer nuclear layer differentiate new photoreceptors- furthermore demonstration transplanted cells form functional synaptic connections neurons recipient retina restore visual function might mature mammalian retina lacks ability accept incorporate stem cells promote photoreceptor differentiation hypothesized committed progenitor precursor cells later ontogenetic stages might higher probability success upon transplantation show donor cells can integrate adult degenerating retina taken developing retina time coincident peak rod genesis transplanted cells integrate differentiate rod photoreceptors form synaptic connections improve visual function furthermore use genetically tagged postmitotic rod precursors expressing transcription factor nrl ref neural retina leucine zipper show successfully integrated rod photoreceptors derived immature post-mitotic rod precursors proliferating progenitor stem cells findings define ontogenetic stage donor cells successful rod photoreceptor transplantation
