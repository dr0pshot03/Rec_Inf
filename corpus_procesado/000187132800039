undesirable evolutionary consequences trophy hunting 
phenotype based selective harvests including trophy hunting can important implications sustainable wildlife management target heritable traits show evolutionary response sport hunting bighorn trophy rams ovis canadensis body weight horn size declined significantly time used quantitative genetic analyses based partly genetically reconstructed pedigree year study wild population trophy hunting targeted rams rapidly growing horns explore evolutionary response hunter selection ram weight horn size traits highly heritable trophy harvested rams significantly higher genetic breeding value weight horn size rams harvested rams high breeding value also shot early age thus achieve high reproductive success declines mean breeding values weight horn size therefore occurred response unrestricted trophy hunting resulting production smaller horned lighter rams fewer trophies
