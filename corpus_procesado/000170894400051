recombination hemagglutinin gene "spanish flu" 
gene sequences influenza virus caused pandemic first compared related viruses yielded clues origins virulence reanalysis indicates hemagglutinin gene key virulence determinant originated recombination "globular domain" hemagglutinin protein encoded part gene derived swine-lineage influenza whereas "stalk" encoded parts derived human-lineage influenza phylogenetic analyses showed recombination probably changed virulence virus occurred start immediately pandemic thus may triggered
