molecular hydrogen beyond optical edge isolated spiral galaxy 
knowledge outermost portions galaxies limited owing small amount light coming known many cases atomic hydrogen h extends well beyond optical radius1 centres galaxies however molecular hydrogen h- usually dominates large factor2- raising question whether h- also abundant outer regions report detection emission carbon monoxide co abundant tracer h- beyond optical radius nearby galaxy ngc host molecular clouds probably formed regions relatively high h column density absence spiral density waves relative strength lines two lowest rotational levels indicates temperature density h- quite low compared conditions closer centre inferred surface density molecular material continues monotonic decrease inner regions conclude although molecular clouds can form outer region galaxy little mass associated
