engram cells retain memory retrograde amnesia
memory consolidation process newly formed unstable memory transforms stable long-term memory unknown whether process memory consolidation occurs exclusively stabilization memory engrams using learning-dependent cell labeling identified increase synaptic strength dendritic spine density specifically consolidated memory engram cells although properties lacking engram cells protein synthesis inhibitor-induced amnesia direct optogenetic activation cells results memory retrieval correlates retained engram cell-specific connectivity propose specific pattern connectivity engram cells may crucial memory information storage strengthened synapses cells critically contribute memory retrieval process
