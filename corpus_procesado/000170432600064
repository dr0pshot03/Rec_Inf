transitions distinct histone h3 methylation patterns heterochromatin domain boundaries 
eukaryotic genomes organized discrete structural functional chromatin domains show distinct site-specific histone h3 methylation patterns define euchromatic heterochromatic chromosomal domains within -kilobase region mating-type locus fission yeast h3 methylated lysine h3 lys9 interacting swi6 protein strictly localized -kilobase silent heterochromatic interval contrast h3 methylated lysine h3 lys4 specific surrounding euchromatic regions two inverted repeats flanking silent interval serve boundary elements mark borders heterochromatin euchromatin deletions boundary elements lead spreading h3 lys9 methylation swi6 neighboring sequences furthermore h3 lys9 methylation corresponding heterochromatin-associated complexes prevent h3 lys4 methylation silent domain
