aftershock signature supershear earthquakes
recent studies show earthquake faults may rupture speeds exceeding shear wave velocity rocks supershear rupture produces ground seismic shock wave similar sonic boom produced supersonic airplane shock wave may increase destruction caused earthquake report supershear earthquakes characterized specific pattern aftershocks: fault plane remarkably quiet whereas aftershocks cluster fault secondary structures activated supershear rupture post earthquake quiescence fault shows friction relatively uniform supershear segments whereas activation fault structures explained shock wave radiation produces high stresses wide zone surrounding fault
