beta camkii lateral habenula mediates core symptoms depression 
lateral habenula lhb recently emerged key brain region pathophysiology depression however molecular mechanism lhb becomes hyperactive depression remains unknown quantitative proteomic screen found expression beta form calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase type ii beta camkii significantly up-regulated lhb animal models depression down-regulated antidepressants increasing beta- alpha- camkii lhb strongly enhanced synaptic efficacy spike output lhb neurons sufficient produce profound depressive symptoms including anhedonia behavioral despair down-regulation beta camkii levels blocking activity target molecule glutamate receptor glur1 reversed depressive symptoms results identify beta camkii powerful regulator lhb neuron function key molecular determinant depression
