topological defect dynamics operando battery nanoparticles
topological defects can markedly alter nanomaterial properties presents opportunities defect engineering desired functionalities generated defect manipulation however imaging defects working devices nanoscale resolution remains elusive report three-dimensional imaging dislocation dynamics individual battery cathode nanoparticles operando conditions using bragg coherent diffractive imaging dislocations static room temperature mobile charge transport structural phase transformation lithium-rich phase nucleates near dislocation spreads inhomogeneously dislocation field local probe elastic properties find region material exhibits negative poissons ratio high voltage operando dislocation imaging thus opens powerful avenue facilitating improvement rational design nanostructured materials
