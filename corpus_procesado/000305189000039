atomic model type iii secretion system needle 
pathogenic bacteria using type iii secretion system t3ss manipulate host cells cause many different infections including shigella dysentery typhoid fever enterohaemorrhagic colitis bubonic plague essential part t3ss hollow needle-like protein filament effector proteins injected eukaryotic host cells- currently three-dimensional structure needle unknown amenable x-ray crystallography solution nmr result inherent non-crystallinity insolubility cryo-electron microscopy combined crystal solution nmr subunit structures recently provided powerful hybrid approach studying supramolecular assemblies- resulting low-resolution medium-resolution models- however approaches deliver atomic details especially crucial subunit-subunit interfaces limited cryo-electron microscopic resolution obtained studies report alternative approach combining recombinant wild-type needle production solid-state nmr electron microscopy rosetta modelling reveal supramolecular interfaces ultimately complete atomic structure salmonella typhimurium t3ss needle show residue subunits form right-handed helical assembly roughly subunits per two turns similar flagellar filament s typhimurium contrast established models needle amino terminus protein subunit assumed alpha-helical positioned inside needle model reveals extended amino-terminal domain positioned surface needle highly conserved carboxy terminus points towards lumen
