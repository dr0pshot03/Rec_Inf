cd3 delta couples t-cell receptor signalling erk activation thymocyte positive selection
thymocytes mice lacking cd3 delta chain t-cell receptor tcr unlike cd3-deficient mice progress cd4-cd8- double-negative cd4+cd8+ double-positive stage however cd3 delta-/- double-positive cells fail undergo positive selection double-positive cells differentiate mature thymocytes positive selection also impaired mice expressing inactive components ras/mitogen activated protein map kinase signalling pathway- show cd3 delta-/- thymocytes defective induction extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase erk map kinases upon tcr engagement whereas activation map kinases unaffected requirement cd3d maps extracellular transmembrane domains expression tail-less cd3d rescues erk activation positive selection cd3 delta-/- mice furthermore defect correlates severely impaired tyrosine phosphorylation linker protein lat cd3 zeta chain localized membrane lipid rafts upon tcr engagement data indicate blockade positive selection cd3 delta-/- thymocytes may derive defective tyrosine phosphorylation cd3z lipid rafts resulting impaired activation lat/ras/erk pathway
