consolidation sleep perceptual learning spoken language 
memory consolidation resulting sleep seen broadly: verbal list learning spatial learning skill acquisition visual- motor- tasks tasks generalize across spatial locations motor sequences different stimuli location although episodic rote learning constitutes large part organisms learning generalization hallmark adaptive behaviour speech phoneme often different acoustic patterns depending context training small set words improves performance novel words using phonemes different acoustic patterns demonstrating perceptual generalization show role sleep consolidation naturalistic spoken-language learning task produces generalization phonological categories across different acoustic patterns recognition performance immediately training showed significant improvement subsequently degraded span days retention interval completely recovered following sleep thus sleep facilitates recovery subsequent retention material learned opportunistically time throughout day performance recovery indicates representations mappings associated generalization refined stabilized sleep
