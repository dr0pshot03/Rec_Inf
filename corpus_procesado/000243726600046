virus fungus plant: three-way symbiosis required thermal tolerance 
mutualistic association fungal endophyte tropical panic grass allows organisms grow high soil temperatures characterized virus fungus involved mutualistic interaction fungal isolates cured virus unable confer heat tolerance heat tolerance restored virus reintroduced virus-infected fungus confers heat tolerance native monocot host also eudicot host suggests underlying mechanism involves pathways conserved two groups plants
