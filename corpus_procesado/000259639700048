unc-/netrin receptor unc locally exclude presynaptic components dendrites 
polarity essential feature many cell types including neurons receive information local inputs within dendrites propagate nerve impulses distant targets single axon generally believed intrinsic structural differences axons dendrites dictate polarized localization axonal dendritic proteins however whether extracellular cues also instruct process vivo explored show axon guidance cue unc-/netrin receptor unc act throughout development exclude synaptic vesicle active zone proteins dendrite caenorhabditis elegans motor neuron da9 proximal source unc / netrin unc / netrin unc loss of-function mutants presynaptic components mislocalize da9 dendrite addition ectopically expressed unc / netrin acting unc sufficient exclude endogenous synapses adjacent subcellular domains within da9 axon furthermore anti synaptogenic activity interchangeable lin / wnt despite transduced different receptors suggesting extracellular cues netrin wnts guide axon navigation also regulate polarized accumulation presynaptic components local exclusion
