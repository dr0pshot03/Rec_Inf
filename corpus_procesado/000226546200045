mathematical models become necessary tool organizing rapidly increasing amounts large-scale data biochemical pathways advanced evaluation structure regulation models addressed specific pathways using either stoichiometric flux-balance analysis fully kinetic michaelis menten representations metabolic control analysis biochemical systems theory- far predictions kinetic models rarely tested using direct experimentation validate experimentally biochemical systems theoretical model sphingolipid metabolism yeast simulations metabolic fluxes enzyme deletion effects inositol key regulator phospholipid metabolism led predictions show significant concordance experimental results generated post hoc model also allowed simulation effects acute perturbations fatty-acid precursors sphingolipids situation amenable direct experimentation results demonstrate modelling now allows testable predictions well design evaluation hypothetical thought experiments may generate new metabolomic approaches
