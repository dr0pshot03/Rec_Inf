apoptosis initiated bcl--regulated caspase activation independently cytochrome c/apaf-/caspase apoptosome 
apoptosis evolutionarily conserved cell suicide process executed cysteine proteases caspases regulated opposing factions bcl protein family mammalian caspase activator apaf thought essential mice lacking either display neuronal hyperplasia lymphocytes fibroblasts seem resistant certain apoptotic stimuli- apaf requires cytochrome c activate caspase- bcl prevents mitochondrial cytochrome c release bcl widely believed inhibit apoptosis safeguarding mitochondrial membrane integrity- results suggest different broader role bcl overexpression increased lymphocyte numbers mice inhibited many apoptotic stimuli absence apaf caspase caspase activity still discernible cells lacking apaf caspase- potent caspase antagonist inhibited apoptosis retarded cytochrome c release conclude bcl regulates caspase activation programme independently cytochrome c/apaf-/caspase apoptosome seems amplify rather initiate caspase cascade
