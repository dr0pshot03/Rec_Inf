enhanced ice sheet growth eurasia owing adjacent ice-dammed lakes 
large proglacial lakes cool regional summer climate large heat capacity shown modify precipitation mesoscale atmospheric feedbacks case lake agassiz several large ice-dammed lakes combined area twice caspian sea formed northern eurasia years ago last glacial period ice sheet centred barents kara seas blocked large northbound russian rivers present high-resolution simulations atmospheric general circulation model explicitly simulates surface mass balance ice sheet show main influence eurasian proglacial lakes significant reduction ice sheet melting southern margin barents kara ice sheet strong regional summer cooling large parts russia simulations summer melt reduction clearly outweighs lake-induced decreases moisture hence snowfall reported earlier lake agassiz1 conclude summer cooling mechanism proglacial lakes accelerated ice sheet growth delayed ice sheet decay eurasia probably also north america
