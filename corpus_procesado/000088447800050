rapid kimberlite ascent significance ar-ar ages xenolith phlogopites
kimberlite eruptions bring exotic rock fragments minerals including diamonds deep within mantle surface fragments rapidly absorbed kimberlite magma appearance surface implies rapid transport depth high spatial resolution ar-ar age data phlogopite grains xenoliths malaita solomon islands southwest pacific elovy island kola peninsula russia indicate transport times hours days depending upon magma temperature addition data show phlogopite grains preserve ar-ar ages recorded high temperature mantle degrees c conventional closure temperature
