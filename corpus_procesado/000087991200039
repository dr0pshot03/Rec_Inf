direct measurement hole transport dynamics dna
understanding oxidative damage double helical dna design dna-based devices molecular electronics crucially dependent upon elucidation mechanism dynamics electron hole transport dna- electrons holes can migrate locus formation trap sites migration can occur either single-step superexchange mechanism multistep charge transport hopping mechanism- rates single-step charge separation charge recombination processes found decrease rapidly increasing transfer distances- whereas multistep hole transport processes weakly distance dependent- however dynamics hole transport yet directly determined report spectroscopic measurements photoinduced electron transfer synthetic dna yield rate constants similar x s- x s- respectively forward return hole transport single guanine base double guanine base step across single adenine rates faster processes leading strand cleavage reaction guanine cation radical water thus permitting holes migrate long distances dna however slow compete charge recombination contact ion pairs process protects dna photochemical damage
