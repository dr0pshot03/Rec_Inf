following translation single ribosomes one codon time 
followed individual ribosomes translate single messenger rna hairpins tethered ends optical tweezers reveal translation occurs successive translocation pause cycles distribution pause lengths median s indicates least two rate determining processes control pause translocation step measures three bases one codon occurs less s analysis times required translocation reveals surprisingly three substeps step pause lengths thus overall rate translation depend secondary structure mrna; applied force destabilizes secondary structure decreases pause durations affect translocation times translocation rna unwinding strictly coupled ribosomal functions
