discretizing light behaviour linear nonlinear waveguide lattices 
light propagating linear nonlinear waveguide lattices exhibits behaviour characteristic encountered discrete systems diffraction properties systems can engineered opens new possibilities controlling flow light otherwise impossible bulk: effects can exploited achieve diffraction free propagation minimize power requirements nonlinear processes two-dimensional networks waveguides self-localized states-or discrete solitons-can travel along wire-like paths can routed destination port possibilities may useful photonic switching architectures
