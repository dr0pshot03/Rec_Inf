observation long supershear rupture magnitude kunlunshan earthquake 
kunlunshan earthquake extraordinary event produced -km-long surface rupture regional broadband recordings event provide opportunity accurately observe speed fault ruptures earthquake important implications seismic risk understanding earthquake physics determined rupture propagated -km-long fault average speed km/s exceeds shear velocity brittle part crust rupture started sub rayleigh wave velocity became supershear probably approaching km/s km propagation
