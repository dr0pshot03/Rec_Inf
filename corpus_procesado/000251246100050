solvent tuning electrochemical potentials active sites hipip versus ferredoxin 
persistent puzzle field biological electron transfer conserved iron-sulfur cluster motif high potential iron-sulfur protein hipip ferredoxin fd active sites despite structural similarity hipips react oxidatively physiological potentials whereas fds reduced sulfur k-edge x-ray absorption spectroscopy uncovers substantial influence hydration variation reactivity fe-s covalency much lower natively hydrated fd active sites hipips increases upon water removal; similarly hipip covalency decreases unfolding exposes otherwise hydrophobically shielded active site water studies model compounds accompanying density functional theory calculations support correlation fe-s covalency ease oxidation therefore suggest hydration accounts difference fd hipip reduction potentials
