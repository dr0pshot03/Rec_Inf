identification tumour suppressor network opposing nuclear akt function 
proto-oncogene akt also known pkb activated many human cancers mostly owing loss pten tumour suppressor1 tumours akt becomes enriched cell membranes activated phosphorylation yet many targets inhibited phosphorylated akt example foxo transcription factors nuclear; remained unclear relevant nuclear phosphorylated akt pakt function tumorigenesis show pml tumour suppressor prevents cancer inactivating pakt inside nucleus find mouse model pml loss markedly accelerates tumour onset incidence progression pten-heterozygous mutants leads female sterility features recapitulate phenotype foxo3a knockout mice2 show pml deficiency leads tumorigenesis prostate tissue exquisitely sensitive pakt levels demonstrate pml specifically recruits akt phosphatase pp2a well pakt pml nuclear bodies notably find pml-null cells impaired pp2a phosphatase activity towards akt thus accumulate nuclear pakt consequence progressive reduction pml dose leads inactivation foxo3a-mediated transcription proapoptotic bim cell cycle inhibitor p27kip1 results demonstrate pml orchestrates nuclear tumour suppressor network inactivation nuclear pakt thus highlight importance akt compartmentalization human cancer pathogenesis treatment
