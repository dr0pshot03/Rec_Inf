homeotic protein agamous controls microsporogenesis regulation sporocyteless
arabidopsis homeotic gene agamous ag necessary specification reproductive organs stamens carpels early steps flower development- ag encodes transcription factor mads-box family expressed stamen carpel primordia later stages development ag expressed distinct regions reproductive organs- suggests ag might function maturation stamens carpels well early development however developmental processes ag might control organogenesis genes regulated factor largely unknown show microsporogenesis process leading pollen formation induced ag activation sporocyteless gene spl also known nozzle nzz regulator sporogenesis furthermore demonstrate spl can induce microsporogenesis absence ag function suggesting ag controls specific process organogenesis activating another regulator performs subset functions
