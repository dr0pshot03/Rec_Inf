long noncoding rna modular scaffold histone modification complexes
long intergenic noncoding rnas lincrnas regulate chromatin states epigenetic inheritance show lincrna hotair serves scaffold least two distinct histone modification complexes domain hotair binds polycomb repressive complex prc2 whereas domain hotair binds lsd1/corest/rest complex ability tether two distinct complexes enables rna-mediated assembly prc2 lsd1 coordinates targeting prc2 lsd1 chromatin coupled histone h3 lysine methylation lysine demethylation results suggest lincrnas may serve scaffolds providing binding surfaces assemble select histone modification enzymes thereby specifying pattern histone modifications target genes
