functional overlap arabidopsis leaf root microbiota 
roots leaves healthy plants host taxonomically structured bacterial assemblies members communities contribute plant growth health established arabidopsis leaf-and root-derived microbiota culture collections representing majority bacterial species reproducibly detectable culture-independent community sequencing found extensive taxonomic overlap leaf root microbiota genome drafts isolates revealed large overlap genome-encoded functional capabilities leaf-and root-derived bacteria significant differences level individual functional categories using defined bacterial communities gnotobiotic arabidopsis plant system show isolates form assemblies resembling natural microbiota cognate host organs also capable ectopic leaf root colonization raises possibility reciprocal relocation root leaf microbiota members genome information recolonization experiments also provide evidence microbiota specialization respective niche
