surface tension transport prey feeding shorebirds: capillary ratchet 
variability bird beak morphology reflects diverse foraging strategies one feeding mechanism shorebirds involves surface tension-induced transport prey millimetric droplets: repeatedly opening closing beak tweezering motion bird moves drop tip beak mouth stepwise ratcheting fashion analyzed subtle physical mechanism responsible drop transport demonstrated experimentally beak geometry dynamics tweezering may tuned optimize transport efficiency also highlight critical dependence capillary ratchet beaks wetting properties thus making clear vulnerability capillary feeders surface pollutants
