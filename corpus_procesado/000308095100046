x-ray optical wave mixing 
light-matter interactions ubiquitous underpin wide range basic research fields applied technologies although optical interactions intensively studied microscopic details often poorly understood far directly measurable x-ray optical wave mixing proposed nearly half century ago atomic-scale probe optical interactions yet observed owing lack sufficiently intense x-ray sources use x-ray laser demonstrate x-ray optical sum-frequency generation underlying nonlinearity reciprocal-space probe optically induced charges associated microscopic fields arise illuminated material within experimental errors measured efficiency consistent first-principles calculations microscopic optical polarization diamond ability probe optical interactions atomic scale offers new opportunities basic applied areas science
