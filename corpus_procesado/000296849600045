global dna demethylation mouse erythropoiesis vivo
mammalian genome -cpg- dinucleotides frequently methylated correlating transcriptional silencing genome-wide demethylation thought occur twice development primordial germ cells pre-implantation embryo demethylation events followed de novo methylation setting pattern inherited throughout development modified tissue-specific loci studied dna methylation differentiating mouse erythroblasts vivo using genomic-scale reduced representation bisulfite sequencing rrbs demethylation erythroid-specific beta-globin locus coincident global dna demethylation genomic elements global demethylation continuous throughout differentiation required rapid dna replication hence dna demethylation can occur globally somatic cell differentiation providing experimental model study development disease
