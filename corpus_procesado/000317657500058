actin-propelled invasive membrane protrusions promote fusogenic protein engagement cell-cell fusion
cell-cell fusion critical conception development physiology multicellular organisms although cellular fusogenic proteins actin cytoskeleton implicated cell-cell fusion remains unclear whether coordinate promote plasma membrane fusion reconstituted high-efficiency inducible cell fusion culture system normally nonfusing drosophila s2r+ cells fusogenic proteins actin cytoskeletal rearrangements necessary cell fusion combination sufficient impart fusion competence localized actin polymerization triggered specific cell-cell cell-matrix adhesion molecules propelled invasive cell membrane protrusions turn promoted fusogenic protein engagement plasma membrane fusion de novo cell fusion culture system reveals general role actin-propelled invasive membrane protrusions driving fusogenic protein engagement cell-cell fusion
