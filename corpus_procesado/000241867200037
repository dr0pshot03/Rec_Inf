boundary lubrication water 
boundary lubrication rubbing surfaces coated molecular monolayers studied extensively half century- monolayers generally consist amphiphilic surfactants anchored polar headgroups sliding occurs interface layers greatly reducing friction especially wear underlying substrates process widespread engineering applications also predicted occur biological lubrication via phospholipid films though systematic studies friction surfactant layers aqueous environments carried show frictional stress two sliding surfaces bearing surfactant monolayers may decrease immersed water little one per cent less value air oil attribute shift slip plane surfactant layers surfactant/ substrate interface low friction due fluid hydration layers surrounding polar head groups attached substrate results may implications future technological biomedical applications
