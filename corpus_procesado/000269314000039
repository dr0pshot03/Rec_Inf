suppression induced pluripotent stem cell generation p53-p21 pathway 
induced pluripotent stemips cells can generated somatic cells introduction oct3/ also known pou5f1 sox2 klf4 c-myc mouse- human- efficiency process however low pluripotency can induced without c-myc even lower efficiency p53 also known tp53 humans trp53 mice short-interfering rna sirna recently shown promote human ips cell generation specificity mechanisms remain determined report % transduced mouse embryonic fibroblasts lacking p53 became ips cells even without myc retrovirus p53 deletion also promoted induction integration-free mouse ips cells plasmid transfection furthermore p53-null background ips cells generated terminally differentiated t lymphocytes suppression p53 also increased efficiency human ips cell generation dna microarray analyses identified p53-regulated genes common mouse human fibroblasts functional analyses genes demonstrate p53-p21 pathway serves barrier tumorigenicity also ips cell generation
