three-dimensional orientation mapping transmission electron microscope
past decade efforts made develop nondestructive techniques three-dimensional 3d grain-orientation mapping crystalline materials 3d x-ray diffraction microscopy differential-aperture x-ray microscopy can now used generate 3d orientation maps spatial resolution nanometers nm describe nondestructive technique enables 3d orientation mapping transmission electron microscope mono-and multiphase nanocrystalline materials spatial resolution reaching nm demonstrate technique experimental study nanocrystalline aluminum sample use simulations validate principles involved
