minimal-excitation states electron quantum optics using levitons
on-demand generation pure quantum excitations important operation quantum systems particularly difficult system fermions perturbation affects states fermi energy resulting complex superposition particle hole excitations however predicted nearly years ago- lorentzian time-dependent potential quantized flux generates minimal excitation one particle hole report quasiparticles hereafter termed levitons can generated demand conductor applying voltage pulses contact partitioning excitations electronic beam splitter generates current noise use measure number minimal-excitation states observed lorentzian pulses whereas pulse shapes significant contributions holes identification levitons provided energy domain shot-noise spectroscopy time domain electronic hong-ou-mandel noise correlations- latter obtained colliding synchronized levitons beam splitter exemplifies potential use levitons quantum information: using linear electron quantum optics ballistic conductors possible imagine flying-qubit operation fermi statistics exploited- entangle synchronized electrons emitted distinct sources- compared electron sources based quantum dots- generation levitons require delicate nanolithography considerably simplifying circuitry scalability levitons limited carrying single charge broader context n-particle levitons find application study full electron counting statistics- can also carry fraction charge implemented luttinger liquids fractional quantum hall edge channels allows study abelian non-abelian quasiparticles time domain finally generation technique applied cold atomic gases leading possibility atomic levitons
