humans integrate visual haptic information statistically optimal fashion 
person looks object exploring hand vision touch provide information estimating properties object vision frequently dominates integrated visual-haptic percept example judging size shape position- circumstances percept clearly affected haptics- propose general principle minimizes variance final estimate determines degree vision haptics dominates principle realized using maximum-likelihood estimation- combine inputs investigate cue combination quantitatively first measured variances associated visual haptic estimation height used measurements construct maximum-likelihood integrator model behaved similarly humans visual-haptic task thus nervous system seems combine visual haptic information fashion similar maximum-likelihood integrator visual dominance occurs variance associated visual estimation lower associated haptic estimation
