asymmetric distribution positrons galactic disk revealed gamma-rays
gamma ray line radiation kev signature electron positron annihilation radiation known years come general direction galactic centre origin positrons remained mystery stellar nucleosynthesis- accreting compact objects- even annihilation exotic dark matter particles suggested report distinct asymmetry kev line emission coming inner galactic disk similar degrees galactic centre asymmetry resembles asymmetry distribution low mass x ray binaries strong emission photon energies > kev hard lmxbs indicating may dominant origin positrons although long suspected electron positron pair plasmas may exist x ray binaries evident many positrons escape lose energy ultimately annihilate electrons interstellar medium thus lead emission narrow kev line models result implies times positrons escape per second typical hard lmxb positron production level hard lmxbs galactic bulge reduce possibly eliminate need exotic explanations involving dark matter
