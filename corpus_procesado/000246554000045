eddy/wind interactions stimulate extraordinary mid-ocean plankton blooms 
episodic eddy-driven upwelling may supply significant fraction nutrients required sustain primary productivity subtropical ocean new observations northwest atlantic reveal although plankton blooms occur cyclones mode-water eddies biological responses differ mode-water eddies can generate extraordinary diatom biomass primary production depth relative time series near bermuda blooms sustained eddy/wind interactions amplify eddy-induced upwelling contrast eddy/wind interactions dampen eddy-induced upwelling cyclones carbon export inferred oxygen anomalies eddy cores one three times much annual new production region
