molecular robots guided prescriptive landscapes 
traditional robots rely function computing store internal representations goals environment coordinate sensing actuation components required response moving robotics single-molecule level possible principle requires facing limited ability individual molecules store complex information programs one strategy overcome problem use systems can obtain complex behaviour interaction simple robots environment- first step direction development dna walkers developed non-autonomous capable directed brief motion one-dimensional tracks- demonstrate previously developed random walkers-so-called molecular spiders comprise streptavidin molecule inert body three deoxyribozymes catalytic legs-show elementary robotic behaviour interacting precisely defined environment single-molecule microscopy observations confirm walkers achieve directional movement sensing modifying tracks substrate molecules laid two-dimensional dna origami landscape using appropriately designed dna origami molecular spiders autonomously carry sequences actions start follow turn stop anticipate strategy will result complex robotic behaviour molecular level additional control mechanisms incorporated one example might interactions multiple molecular robots leading collective behaviour another might ability read transform secondary cues dna origami landscape means implementing turing-universal algorithmic behaviour
