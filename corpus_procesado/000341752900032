metabolic control cell death 
beyond contribution basic metabolism major cellular organelles particular mitochondria can determine whether cells respond stress adaptive suicidal manner thus mitochondria can continuously adapt shape changing bioenergetic demands subjected quality control autophagy can undergo lethal permeabilization process initiates apoptosis along similar lines multiple proteins involved metabolic circuitries including oxidative phosphorylation transport metabolites across membranes may participate regulated catastrophic dismantling organelles many factors initially characterized cell death regulators now known physically functionally interact metabolic enzymes thus several metabolic cues regulate propensity cells activate self-destructive programs part acting nutrient sensors suggests existence "metabolic checkpoints" dictate cell fate response metabolic fluctuations discuss recent insights intersection metabolism cell death regulation major implications comprehension manipulation unwarranted cell loss
