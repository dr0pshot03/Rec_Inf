phylogenomic analyses unravel annelid evolution 
annelida ringed worms highly diverse animal phylum includes described species constitutes dominant benthic macrofauna intertidal zone deep sea robust annelid phylogeny shape understanding animal body-plan evolution shed light bilaterian ground pattern traditionally annelida split two major groups: clitellata earthworms leeches polychaetes bristle worms recent evidence suggests taxa considered separate phyla sipuncula echiura siboglinidae also known pogonophora included annelida- however deep-level evolutionary relationships annelida still poorly understood robust reconstruction annelid evolutionary history needed show phylogenomic analyses annelid taxa using amino acid positions recovered well-supported phylogeny strong support major splits results recover chaetopterids myzostomids sipunculids basal part tree although position myzostomida remains uncertain owing long branch remaining taxa split two clades: errantia includes model annelid platynereis sedentaria includes clitellata ancestral character trait reconstructions indicate clades show adaptation either errant sedentary lifestyle alteration accompanying morphological traits peristaltic movement parapodia sensory perception finally life history characters annelida seem phylogenetically informative
