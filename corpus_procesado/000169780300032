approach high-resolution ex situ nmr spectroscopy
nuclear magnetic resonance nmr experiments typically performed samples immersed magnet shimmed high homogeneity however many circumstances impractical undesirable insert objects subjects bore high-field magnet present methodology based adaptation nutation echoes provides resolved spectra presence matched inhomogeneous static radiofrequency fields thereby opening way high-resolution exsitu nmr observation chemical shifts regained use multiple-pulse sequences correlated composite z-rotation pulses producing resolved nmr spectra liquid samples
