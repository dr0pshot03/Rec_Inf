salmonella inhibits retrograde trafficking mannose--phosphate receptors lysosome function
salmonella enterica intracellular bacterial pathogen replicates within membrane-bound vacuoles action effector proteins translocated host cells salmonella vacuoles characteristics lysosomes reduced hydrolytic enzymes transported mannose--phosphate receptors mprs found effector sifa subverted rab9-dependent retrograde trafficking mprs thereby attenuating lysosome function required binding sifa host cell target skip/plekhm2 furthermore skip regulated retrograde trafficking mprs noninfected cells translocated sifa formed stable complex skip rab9 infected cells sequestration rab9 sifa-skip accounted effect sifa mpr transport lysosome function growth salmonella increased cells reduced lysosomal activity decreased cells higher lysosomal activity results suggest salmonella vacuoles undergo fusion lysosomes whose potency reduced sifa
