increased wnt signaling aging alters muscle stem cell fate increases fibrosis 
regenerative potential skeletal muscle declines age impairment associated increase tissue fibrosis show muscle stem cells satellite cells aged mice tend convert myogenic fibrogenic lineage begin proliferate conversion mediated factors systemic environment old animals also show lineage conversion associated activation canonical wnt signaling pathway aged myogenic progenitors can suppressed wnt inhibitors furthermore components serum aged mice bind frizzled family proteins wnt receptors may account elevated wnt signaling aged cells results indicate wnt signaling pathway may play critical role tissue-specific stem cell aging increase tissue fibrosis age
