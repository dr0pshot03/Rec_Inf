molecular identification taste receptor gene trehalose drosophila 
molecular nature sweet taste receptors fully explored employing differential screening strategy identified taste receptor gene tre1 controls taste sensitivity trehalose drosophila melanogaster tre1 gene encodes novel protein similarity g protein-coupled seven-transmembrane receptors disruption tre1 gene lowered taste sensitivity trehalose whereas sensitivities sugars unaltered overexpression tre1 gene restored taste sensitivity trehalose tre1 deletion mutant tre1 gene expressed taste sensory cells results provide direct evidence tre1 encodes putative taste receptor trehalose drosophila
