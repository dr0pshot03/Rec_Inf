correlates sleep waking drosophila melanogaster
drosophila exhibits circadian rest-activity cycle known whether fly rest constitutes sleep mere inactivity shown like mammalian sleep rest drosophila characterized increased arousal threshold homeostatically regulated independently circadian clock mammals rest abundant young flies reduced older flies modulated stimulants hypnotics several molecular markers modulated sleep waking mammals modulated rest activity drosophila including cytochrome oxidase c endoplasmic reticulum chaperone protein bip enzymes implicated catabolism monoamines flies lacking one enzyme arylalkylamine n-acetyltransferase show increased rest rest deprivation results implicate catabolism monoamines regulation sleep waking fly suggest drosophila may serve model system genetic dissection sleep
