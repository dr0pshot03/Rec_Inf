polarized myosin produces unequal-size daughters asymmetric cell division
asymmetric positioning mitotic spindle cytokinesis can produce different-sized daughter cells distinct fates found asymmetric division caenorhabditis elegans q neuroblast lineage began centered spindle generated different-sized daughters smaller anterior underwent apoptosis division myosin ii accumulated anteriorly suggesting asymmetric contractile forces might produce different-sized daughters indeed partial inactivation anterior myosin chromophore-assisted laser inactivation created symmetric division allowed survival differentiation anterior daughter thus balance myosin activity two sides dividing cell can govern size fate daughters
