r2d2 bridge initiation effector steps drosophila rnai pathway 
rna interference rnai pathway initiated processing long double-stranded rna small interfering rna sirna sirna-generating enzyme purified drosophila s2 cells consists two stoichiometric subunits: dicer dcr- previously unknown protein named r2d2 r2d2 homologous caenorhabditis elegans rnai protein rde- association r2d2 affect enzymatic activity dcr- rather dcr-/r2d2 complex dcr alone binds sirna enhances sequence-specific messenger rna degradation mediated rna-initiated silencing complexrisc results indicate r2d2 bridges initiation effector steps drosophila rnai pathway facilitating sirna passage dicer risc
