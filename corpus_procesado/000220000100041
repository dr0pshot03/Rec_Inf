cross-linking cellular prion protein triggers neuronal apoptosis vivo
neuronal death prominent poorly understood pathological hallmark prion disease notably absence cellular prion protein prpc disease-associated isoform prpsc appears intrinsically neurotoxic suggesting prpc may participate directly prion neurodegenerative cascade cross-linking prpc vivo specific monoclonal antibodies found trigger rapid extensive apoptosis hippocampal cerebellar neurons findings suggest prpc functions control neuronal survival provides model explore whether cross-linking prpc oligomeric prpsc can promote neuronal loss prion infection
