magnetic field surrounding starburst nucleus galaxy m82 polarized dust emission 
magnetic fields may play important role star-formation process especially central regions starburst galaxies star formation vigorous field directions difficult determine dense molecular gas stars form hitherto impossible test hypothesis dust grains interstellar clouds tend magnetically aligned possible determine alignment direction based polarization optical light due preferential extinction along long axes aligned grains technique works however diffuse gas dense molecular gas report observations polarized thermal emission aligned dust grains central region m82 directly traces magnetic field structure projected onto plane sky organized field lines seen around brightest star-forming regions dusty halo field lines form giant magnetic bubble possibly blown galaxys superwind
