evolution complex life cycles helminth parasites 
fundamental question complex life cycles-where typically one host-evolve host-parasite systems remains largely unexplored suggest complex cycles helminths without penetrative infective stages evolve two essentially different processes depending cycle new host inserted upward incorporation new definitive host typically higher food web preys original definitive host added advantages parasite avoidance mortality due predator greater body size maturity higher fecundity original host typically becomes intermediate host reproduction suppressed downward incorporation new intermediate host added lower trophic level reduces mortality facilitates transmission original definitive host two processes also apply helminths penetrative infective stages although mathematical conditions differ
