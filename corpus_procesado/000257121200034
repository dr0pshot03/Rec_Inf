tryptophan-accelerated electron flow proteins 
energy flow biological structures often requires submillisecond charge transport long molecular distances kinetics modeling suggests charge transfer rates can greatly enhanced multistep electron tunneling redox active amino acid side chains act intermediate donors acceptors report transient optical infrared spectroscopic experiments quantify extent intervening tryptophan residue can facilitate electron transfer distant metal redox centers mutant pseudomonas aeruginosa azurin cu1 oxidation photoexcited re1 diimine position histidine glycine tryptophan -methionine beta strand occurs nanoseconds fully two orders magnitude faster documented single step electron tunneling angstrom donor acceptor distance
