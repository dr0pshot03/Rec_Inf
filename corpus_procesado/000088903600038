multiscale modelling plastic flow localization irradiated materials 
irradiation metals energetic particles causes significant degradation mechanical properties notably increased yield stress decreased ductility often accompanied plastic flow localization effects limit lifetime pressure vessels nuclear power plants constrain choice materials fusion-based alternative energy sources although phenomena known many years underlying fundamental mechanisms relation irradiation field clearly demonstrated use three-dimensional multiscale simulations irradiated metals reveal mechanisms underlying plastic flow localization defect-free channels observe dislocation pinning irradiation-induced clusters defects subsequent unpinning defects absorbed dislocations cross-slip latter stress increased width plastic flow channels limited interaction among opposing dislocation dipole segments remaining defect clusters
