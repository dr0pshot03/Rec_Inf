recent northern hemisphere tropical expansion primarily driven black carbon tropospheric ozone
observational analyses shown width tropical belt increasing recent decades world warmed expansion important associated shifts large-scale atmospheric circulation- major climate zones although recent studies attributed tropical expansion southern hemisphere ozone depletion- drivers northern hemisphere expansion well known expansion far reproduced climate models use climate model detailed aerosol physics show increases heterogeneous warming agents-including black carbon aerosols tropospheric ozone-are noticeably better greenhouse gases driving expansion can account observed summertime maximum tropical expansion mechanistically atmospheric heating black carbon tropospheric ozone occurred mid-latitudes generating poleward shift tropospheric jet thereby relocating main division tropical temperate air masses although still underestimate tropical expansion true aerosol forcing poorly known also underestimated thus although insensitivity models needs investigation black carbon tropospheric ozone strongly influenced human activities likely causes observed northern hemisphere tropical expansion
