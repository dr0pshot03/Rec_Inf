geomagnetic fluctuations reveal stable stratification top earths core
modern observations geomagnetic field reveal fluctuations- dominant period years fluctuations probably result waves liquid core although precise nature waves uncertain common suggestions include type magnetic wave known torsional oscillation recent studies favour periods short account year fluctuation another possibility involves mac waves arise interplay magnetic archimedes coriolis forces waves suitable period can emerge top core stably stratified show mac waves provide good description time-dependent zonal flow top core inferred geomagnetic secular variation wave motion can also account unexplained fluctuations dipole field independent predictions require kilometre-thick stratified layer buoyancy frequency comparable earths rotation rate stratified layer thermal origin implying core heat flow terawatts alternatively layer result chemical stratification either case existence stratified layer top core obscures nature flow deeper core magnetic field continually regenerated
