mass transfer origin blue stragglers ngc revealed half-solar-mass companions 
open star clusters members formed time blue straggler stars typically observed brighter bluer hydrogen-burning main-sequence stars therefore already evolved giant stars stellar remnants correlations blue straggler frequency cluster binary star fraction core mass radial position suggest mass transfer mergers binary stars dominates production blue stragglers open clusters analytic models detailed observations sophisticated n-body simulations however argue favour stellar collisions report blue stragglers long-period binaries old 7x10-year open cluster ngc companions masses half solar mass surprisingly narrow mass distribution conclusively rules collisional origin collision hypothesis predicts companion mass distribution significantly higher masses mergers hierarchical triple stars marginally permitted data observations favour hypothesis data highly consistent mass transfer origin long-period blue straggler binaries ngc companions white dwarfs half solar mass
