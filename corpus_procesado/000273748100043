mutational robustness can facilitate adaptation 
robustness seems opposite evolvability phenotypes robust mutation might expect population will difficulty adapting environmental change several studies suggested- however studies contend robust organisms adaptable- quantitative understanding relationship robustness evolvability will help resolve conflicting reports will clarify outstanding problems molecular experimental evolution evolutionary developmental biology protein engineering demonstrate using general population genetics model mutational robustness can either impede facilitate adaptation depending population size mutation rate structure fitness landscape particular neutral diversity robust population can accelerate adaptation long number phenotypes accessible individual mutation smaller total number phenotypes fitness landscape results provide quantitative resolution significant ambiguity evolutionary theory
