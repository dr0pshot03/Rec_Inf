hiv preferentially infects hiv-specific cd4+ t cells 
hiv infection associated progressive loss cd4+ t cells destruction decreased production central yet unresolved issue hiv disease mechanism loss particular whether hiv-specific cd4+ t cells preferentially affected- show hiv-specific memory cd4+ t cells infected individuals contain hiv viral dna memory cd4+ t cells stages hiv disease additionally following viral rebound interruption antiretroviral therapy frequency hiv viral dna hiv-specific pool memory cd4+ t cells increases greater extent memory cd4+ t cells specificities findings show hiv-specific cd4+ t cells preferentially infected hiv vivo provides potential mechanism explain loss hiv-specific cd4+ t-cell responses consequently loss immunological control hiv replication furthermore phenomenon hiv specifically infecting cells respond adds cautionary note practice structured therapy interruption
