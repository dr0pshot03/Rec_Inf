origin human bipedalism adaptation locomotion flexible branches
human bipedalism commonly thought evolved quadrupedal terrestrial precursor yet recent paleontological evidence suggests adaptations bipedalism arose arboreal context however adaptive benefit arboreal bipedalism unknown show allows arboreal great ape orangutan access supports flexible negotiated otherwise orangutans react branch flexibility like humans running springy tracks increasing knee hip extension whereas primates reverse human bipedalism thus less innovation exploitation locomotor behavior retained common great ape ancestor
