north atlantic ocean control surface heat flux multidecadal timescales 
nearly years ago bjerknes1 suggested character large-scale air-sea interaction mid-latitude north atlantic ocean differs timescales: atmosphere thought drive directly short-term-interannual-sea surface temperature sst variability ocean contribute significantly long-term-multidecadal-sst potentially atmospheric variability although conjecture short timescales well accepted understanding atlantic multidecadal variability amv sst23 remains challenge result limited ocean observations amv nonetheless major socio-economic importance linked important climate phenomena atlantic hurricane activity sahel rainfall hinders detection anthropogenic signals north atlantic sector4- direct evidence oceanic influence amv can provided surface heat fluxes language ocean-atmosphere communication provide observational evidence mid-latitude north atlantic timescales longer years surface turbulent heat fluxes indeed driven ocean may force atmosphere whereas shorter timescales converse true thereby confirming bjerknes conjecture result although strongest boreal winter found seasons findings suggest predictability mid-latitude north atlantic air-sea interaction extend beyond ocean climate surrounding continents
