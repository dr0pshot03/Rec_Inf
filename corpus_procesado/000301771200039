large-scale vortex lattice emerging collectively moving microtubules 
spontaneous collective motion flocks bird schools fish example emergent phenomenon phenomena present great interest- physicists put forward number theoretical results far lack experimental verification- animal behaviour studies large-scale data collection now technologically possible data still scarce arise observations rather controlled experiments multicellular biological systems bacterial colonies tissues allow control may many hidden variables interactions hindering proper tests theoretical ideas however systems subcellular scale tests may possible particularly vitro experiments purified components- motility assays protein filaments driven molecular motors grafted substrate presence atp can show collective motion high densities motors attached filaments demonstrated recently actomyosin system complete understanding mechanisms work still lacking report experiments microtubules propelled surface-bound dyneins system possible study local interaction: find colliding microtubules align high probability high densities alignment results self-organization microtubules average mu m long vortices diameters around mu m inside vortices microtubules circulate clockwise anticlockwise longer timescales vortices form lattice structure emergence structures verified mathematical model result smooth reptation-like motion single microtubules combination local interactions nematic alignment due collisions-there need long-range interactions apart potential relevance cortical arrays plant cells biological situations study provides evidence existence previously unsuspected universality classes collective motion phenomena
