gabaergic projection zona incerta cortex promotes cortical neuron development 
gamma-aminobutyric acid gaba major inhibitory transmitter mature brain excitatory developing cortex found mouse zona incerta zi projection neurons form gabaergic axon plexus neonatal cortical layer making synapses neurons deep superficial layers similar depolarizing gabaergic plexus exists developing human cortex selectively silencing mouse zi gabaergic neurons birth decreased synaptic activity apical dendritic complexity cortical neurons zi gabaergic projection becomes inhibitory maturation can block epileptiform activity adult brain data reveal early-developing gabaergic projection zi cortical layer essential proper development cortical neurons balances excitation inhibition adult cortex
