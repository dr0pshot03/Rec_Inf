computational improvements reveal great bacterial diversity high metal toxicity soil
complexity soil bacterial communities thus far confounded effective measurement however improved analytical methods show abundance distribution total diversity can deciphered reanalysis reassociation kinetics bacterial community dna pristine metal-polluted soils showed power law best described abundance distributions one million distinct genomes occurred pristine soil exceeding previous estimates two orders magnitude metal pollution reduced diversity % revealing highly toxic effect metal contamination especially rare taxa
