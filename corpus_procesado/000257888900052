manipulating metazoan mitochondrial genome targeted restriction enzymesu
high copy number random segregation confound genetic analysis mitochondrial genome developed efficient selection heritable mitochondrial genome mtdna mutations drosophila thereby enhancing metazoan model study mitochondrial genetics mutations causing human mitochondrial disease targeting restriction enzyme mitochondria germline compromised fertility escaper progeny carried homoplasmic mtdna mutations lacking cleavage site among mutations eliminating site cytochrome c oxidase gene mt:cola302t healthy mt:coir301l male sterile otherwise healthy mt: coir301s exhibited wide range defects including growth retardation neurodegeneration muscular atrophy male sterility reduced life span thus germline expression mitochondrial restriction enzymes creates powerful selection allowed direct isolation mitochondrial mutants metazoan
