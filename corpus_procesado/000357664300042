autoassociative dynamics generation sequences hippocampal place cells 
neuronal circuits produce self-sustaining sequences activity patterns precise mechanisms remain unknown provide evidence autoassociative dynamics sequence generation sharp-wave ripple swr events hippocampal neurons express sequenced reactivations show composed discrete attractors attractor corresponds single location representation sharpens course several milliseconds reactivation focuses location subsequently reactivation transitions rapidly spatially discontiguous location alternation sharpening transition occurs repeatedly within individual swrs locked slow-gamma hertz rhythm findings support theoretical notions neural network function reveal fundamental discretization retrieval memory hippocampus together function gamma oscillations control attractor dynamics
