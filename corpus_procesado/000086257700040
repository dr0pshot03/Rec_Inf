imaging localized electronic states quantum hall regime 
concept electron localization long accepted essential physics quantum hall effect two-dimensional electron gas exact quantization ball resistance zero diagonal resistance range filling factors close integral attributed localization electronic states fermi level interior gas electron density changed charging individual localized states may occur single-electron jumps causing associated oscillations local electrostatic potential search manifestation localized states quantum hall regime using scanning electrometer probe observe localized potential signals numerous locations oscillate changing electron density general corresponding spatial patterns complex well-defined objects often seen evidently arise individual localized states objects interact times form lattice-like arrangement
