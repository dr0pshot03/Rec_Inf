iron corrosion novel anaerobic microorganisms 
corrosion iron presents serious economic problem whereas aerobic corrosion chemical process anaerobic corrosion frequently linked activity sulphate-reducing bacteria srb- srb supposed act upon iron primarily produced hydrogen sulphide corrosive agent consumption cathodic hydrogen formed iron contact water- among srb desulfovibrio species capacity consume hydrogen effectively conventionally regarded main culprits anaerobic corrosion-- however underlying mechanisms complex insufficiently understood describe novel marine corrosive types srb obtained via isolation approach metallic iron electron donor particular desulfobacterium-like isolate reduced sulphate metallic iron much faster conventional hydrogen-scavenging desulfovibrio species suggesting novel surface-attached cell type obtained electrons metallic iron direct manner via free hydrogen similarly newly isolated methanobacterium-like archaeon produced methane iron faster known hydrogen-using methanogens suggesting direct access electrons iron via hydrogen consumption
