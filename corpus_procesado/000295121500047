human sperm binding mediated sialyl-lewisx oligosaccharide zona pellucida 
human fertilization begins spermatozoa bind extracellular matrix coating oocyte known zona pellucida zp one spermatozoan penetrates matrix fuses egg cell generating zygote although carbohydrate sequences zp implicated sperm binding nature ligand unknown ultrasensitive mass spectrometric analyses revealed sialyl-lewisx sequence [neuac alpha -3gal beta -4fuc alpha -3glcnac] well-known selectin ligand abundant terminal sequence n o-glycans human zp sperm-zp binding largely inhibited glycoconjugates terminated sialyl-lewisx sequences antibodies directed sequence thus sialyl-lewisx sequence represents major carbohydrate ligand human sperm-egg binding
