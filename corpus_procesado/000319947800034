kat5 tyrosine phosphorylation couples chromatin sensing atm signalling
detection dna lesions within chromatin represents critical step cellular responses dna damage however regulatory mechanisms couple chromatin sensing dna-damage signalling mammalian cells well understood show tyrosine phosphorylation protein acetyltransferase kat5 also known tip60 increases dna damage manner promotes kat5 binding histone mark h3k9me3 triggers kat5-mediated acetylation atm kinase promoting dna-damage-checkpoint activation cell survival also establish chromatin alterations can enhance kat5 tyrosine phosphorylation atm-dependent signalling identify proto-oncogene c-abl mediator modification findings define kat5 tyrosine phosphorylation key event sensing genomic chromatin perturbations highlight key role c-abl processes
