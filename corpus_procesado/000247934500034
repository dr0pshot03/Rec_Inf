structural basis transcription elongation bacterial rna polymerase 
rna polymerase elongation complex ec highly stable processive rapidly extending rna chains thousands nucleotides understanding mechanisms elongation regulation requires detailed information structural organization ec report -angstrom resolution structure thermus thermophilus ec; structure reveals post-translocated intermediate dna template active site available pairing substrate dna strand separation occurs one position downstream active site implying one substrate time can specifically bind ec upstream edge rna/dna hybrid stacks beta-subunit lid loop whereas first displaced rna base trapped within protein pocket suggesting mechanism rna displacement rna threaded rna exit channel adopts conformation mimicking single strand within double helix providing insight mechanism hairpin-dependent pausing termination
