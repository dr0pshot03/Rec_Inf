strong interactions multimode random lasers
unlike conventional lasers diffusive random lasers drls resonator trap light high q resonances support lasing lack sharp resonances drl presented challenge conventional laser theory present theory able treat drl rigorously provide results lasing spectra internal fields output intensities drls typically drls highly multimode lasers emitting light number wavelengths show modal interactions gain medium lasers extremely strong lead uniformly spaced frequency spectrum agreement recent experimental observations
