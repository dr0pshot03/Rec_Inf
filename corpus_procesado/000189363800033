polar ocean stratification cold climate
low-latitude ocean strongly stratified warmth surface water result great volume deep ocean easiest access atmosphere polar surface ocean modern polar ocean winter vertical distribution temperature promotes overturning colder water warmer salinity distribution typically promotes stratification fresher water saltier however sensitivity seawater density temperature reduced temperature approaches freezing point potential consequences global ocean circulation cold climates present deep-sea records biogenic opal accumulation sedimentary nitrogen isotopic composition sub-arctic north pacific ocean southern ocean records indicate vertical stratification increased northern southern high latitudes million years ago northern hemisphere glaciation intensified association global cooling late pliocene epoch propose cooling caused increased stratification weakening role temperature polar ocean density structure reduce opposition stratifying effect vertical salinity distribution shift towards stratification polar ocean million years ago may increased quantity carbon dioxide trapped abyss amplifying global cooling
