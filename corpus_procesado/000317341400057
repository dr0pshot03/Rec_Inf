blockade chronic type interferon signaling control persistent lcmv infection 
type interferons ifn-i critical antiviral immunity however chronic ifn-i signaling associated hyperimmune activation disease progression persistent infections demonstrated mice blockade ifn-i signaling diminished chronic immune activation immune suppression restored lymphoid tissue architecture increased immune parameters associated control virus replication ultimately facilitating clearance persistent infection accelerated control persistent infection induced blocking ifn-i signaling required cd4 t cells associated enhanced ifn-gamma production thus demonstrated interfering chronic ifn-i signaling persistent infection redirects immune environment enable control infection
