turning surface superrepellent even completely wetting liquids 
superhydrophobic superoleophobic surfaces far made roughening hydrophobic material however surfaces able repel extremely-low-energy liquids fluorinated solvents completely wet even hydrophobic material show roughness alone made specific doubly reentrant structure enables low liquid-solid contact fraction can render surface material superrepellent starting completely wettable material silica micro-and nanostructure surface make superomniphobic bounce available liquids including perfluorohexane superomniphobicity confirmed identical surfaces metal polymer free hydrophobic coating superomniphobic silica surface also withstands temperatures degrees c resists biofouling
