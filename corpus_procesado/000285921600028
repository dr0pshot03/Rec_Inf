reversing ephb2 depletion rescues cognitive functions alzheimer model
amyloid-beta oligomers may cause cognitive deficits alzheimers disease impairing neuronal nmda-type glutamate receptors whose function regulated receptor tyrosine kinase ephb2 show amyloid-beta oligomers bind fibronectin repeats domain ephb2 trigger ephb2 degradation proteasome determine pathogenic importance ephb2 depletions alzheimers disease related models used lentiviral constructs reduce increase neuronal expression ephb2 memory centres mouse brain nontransgenic mice knockdown ephb2 mediated short hairpin rna reduced nmda receptor currents impaired long-term potentiation dentate gyrus important memory formation increasing ephb2 expression dentate gyrus human amyloid precursor protein transgenic mice reversed deficits nmda receptor-dependent long-term potentiation memory impairments thus depletion ephb2 critical amyloid-beta-induced neuronal dysfunction increasing ephb2 levels function beneficial alzheimers disease
