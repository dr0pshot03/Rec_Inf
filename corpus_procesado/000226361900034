time-domain measurements nanomagnet dynamics driven spin-transfer torques
present time-resolved measurements gigahertz-scale magnetic dynamics caused torque spin-polarized current working time domain determined motion magnetic moment throughout process spin-transfer-driven switching measured turn-on times steady-state precessional modes time-resolved studies magnetic relaxation allow direct measurement magnetic damping nanomagnet prove damping can controlled electrically using spin-polarized currents
