somatic control germline stem cell lineage drosophila spermatogenesis
stem cells divide produce new stem cells generate daughter cells can differentiate underlying mechanisms well understood conceptually two kinds intrinsic mechanisms may control unequal partitioning determinants leading asymmetric cell divisions yield one stem cell one differentiated daughter cell alternatively extrinsic mechanisms involving stromal cell signals cause daughter cells remain proper niche stay stem cells whereas daughter cells leave niche differentiate use drosophila spermatogenesis model stem cell system show excess stem cells gonialblasts testes deficient raf activity addition germline stem cell population remains active longer fraction lifespan wild type finally raf required somatic cells surround germ cells conclude cell-extrinsic mechanism regulates germline stem cell behaviour
