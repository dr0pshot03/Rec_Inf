somatic control germline stem cell lineage drosophila spermatogenesis 
stem cells divide produce new stem cells generate daughter cells can differentiate1 underlying mechanisms well understood conceptually two kinds2 intrinsic mechanisms may control unequal partitioning determinants leading asymmetric cell divisions yield one stem cell one differentiated daughter cell alternatively extrinsic mechanisms involving stromal cell signals cause daughter cells remain proper niche stay stem cells whereas daughter cells leave niche differentiate use drosophila spermatogenesis model stem cell system3 show excess stem cells gonialblasts testes deficient raf activity addition germline stem cell population remains active longer fraction lifespan wild type finally raf required somatic cells surround germ cells conclude cell-extrinsic mechanism regulates germline stem cell behaviour
