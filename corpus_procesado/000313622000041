metamaterial apertures computational imaging 
leveraging metamaterials compressive imaging low-profile aperture capable microwave imaging without lenses moving parts phase shifters demonstrated designer aperture allows image compression performed physical hardware layer rather postprocessing stage thus averting detector storage transmission costs associated full diffraction-limited sampling scene guided-wave metamaterial aperture used perform compressive image reconstruction frames per second two-dimensional range angle sparse still video scenes k-band gigahertz frequencies using frequency diversity avoid mechanical scanning image acquisition accomplished : compression ratio
