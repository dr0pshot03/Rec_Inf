circadian molecular clock creates epidermal stem cell heterogeneity
murine epidermal stem cells undergo alternate cycles dormancy activation fuelling tissue renewal however subset stem cells becomes active round morphogenesis indicating stem cells coexist heterogeneous responsive states using circadian-clock reporter-mouse model show dormant hair-follicle stem cell niche contains coexisting populations cells opposite phases clock differentially predisposed respond homeostatic cues core clock protein bmal1 modulates expression stem cell regulatory genes oscillatory manner create populations either predisposed less prone activation disrupting clock equilibrium deletion bmal1 also known arntl per1/ resulted progressive accumulation depletion dormant stem cells respectively stem cell arrhythmia also led premature epidermal ageing reduction development squamous tumours results indicate circadian clock fine-tunes temporal behaviour epidermal stem cells perturbation affects homeostasis predisposition tumorigenesis
