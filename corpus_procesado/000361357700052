rna-seq single prostate ctcs implicates noncanonical wnt signaling antiandrogen resistance
prostate cancer initially responsive androgen deprivation effectiveness androgen receptor ar inhibitors recurrent disease variable biopsy bone metastases challenging hence sampling circulating tumor cells ctcs may reveal drug-resistance mechanisms established single-cell rna-sequencing rna-seq profiles intact ctcs isolated patients mean six ctcs per patient using microfluidic enrichment single ctcs individual display considerable heterogeneity including expression ar gene mutations splicing variants retrospective analysis ctcs patients progressing treatment ar inhibitor compared untreated cases indicates activation noncanonical wnt signaling p ectopic expression wnt5a prostate cancer cells attenuates antiproliferative effect ar inhibition whereas suppression drug-resistant cells restores partial sensitivity correlation also evident established mouse model thus single-cell analysis prostate ctcs reveals heterogeneity signaling pathways contribute treatment failure
