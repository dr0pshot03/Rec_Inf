amplification chirality two-dimensional enantiomorphous lattices 
concept chirality dates back pasteur manually separated left-handed right-handed sodium ammonium tartrate crystals crystallization still important means separating chiral molecules two different mirror-image isomers enantiomers yet remains poorly understood example firm rules predict whether particular pair chiral partners will follow behaviour vast majority chiral molecules crystallize together racemic crystals separate enantiomers somewhat simpler tractable version phenomenon crystallization two dimensions formation surface structures adsorbed molecules relatively simple spatial molecular arrangement systems makes easier study effects specific chiral interactions moreover chiral assembly recognition processes can observed directly molecular resolution using scanning tunnelling microscopy- enantioseparation chiral molecules two dimensions expected occur readily planar confinement excludes bulk crystal symmetry elements enhances chiral interactions however many surface structures found racemic- show chiral hydrocarbon heptahelicene cu surface undergo two-dimensional spontaneous resolution enantiomers still shows enantiomorphism mesoscopic length scale readily amplified observe formation racemic heptahelicene domains non-superimposable mirror-like lattice structures small excess one heptahelicene enantiomers suppressing formation one domain type similar induction homochirality achiral enantiomorphous monolayers chiral modifier small enantiomeric excess suffices ensure entire molecular monolayer consists domains one two possible non-superimposable mirror-like lattice structures
