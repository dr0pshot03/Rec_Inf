creb-binding protein modulates repeat instability drosophila model polyq disease
although expansion trinucleotide repeats accounts human diseases mechanisms repeat instability remain poorly understood show drosophila model cag/polyglutamine polyq disease spinocerebellar ataxia type recapitulates key features human cag-repeat instability including large repeat changes strong expansion bias instability dramatically enhanced transcription modulated nuclear excision repair regulator dna repair adenosine monophosphate camp response element-binding protein creb-binding protein-a histone acetyltransferase hat whose decreased activity contributes polyq disease pharmacological treatment normalize acetylation suppressed instability thus toxic consequences pathogenic polyq protein may include enhancing repeat instability
