single-cell rna-seq highlights intratumoral heterogeneity primary glioblastoma
human cancers complex ecosystems composed cells distinct phenotypes genotypes epigenetic states current models adequately reflect tumor composition patients used single-cell rna sequencing rna-seq profile cells five primary glioblastomas found inherently variable expression diverse transcriptional programs related oncogenic signaling proliferation complement/immune response hypoxia also observed continuum stemness-related expression states enabled us identify putative regulators stemness vivo finally show established glioblastoma subtype classifiers variably expressed across individual cells within tumor demonstrate potential prognostic implications intratumoral heterogeneity thus reveal previously unappreciated heterogeneity diverse regulatory programs central glioblastoma biology prognosis therapy
