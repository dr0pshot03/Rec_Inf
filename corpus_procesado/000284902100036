manufacturing molecules metabolic engineering 
metabolic engineering potential produce simple readily available inexpensive starting materials large number chemicals currently derived nonrenewable resources limited natural resources microbial production natural products achieved transferring product-specific enzymes entire metabolic pathways rare genetically intractable organisms can readily engineered production unnatural specialty chemicals bulk chemicals fuels enabled combining enzymes pathways different hosts single microorganism engineering enzymes new function whereas existing production routes use well-known safe industrial microorganisms future production schemes may include designer cells tailor-made desired chemical production process future metabolic engineering will soon rival potentially eclipse synthetic organic chemistry
