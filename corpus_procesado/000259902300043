base sequence higher-order structure induce complex excited-state dynamics dna
high photostability dna commonly attributed efficient radiationless electronic relaxation processes used femtosecond time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy reveal ensuing dynamics strongly dependent base sequence also affected higher-order structure excited electronic state lifetimes dg-doped da single-stranded dna dg center dot dc-doped dacenter dot dt double-stranded dna decrease sharply substitution bases duplexes containing daga center dot dtct dag center dot dtc repeats deactivation fluorescing states occurs subpicosecond time scale excited-state lifetimes increase extended dg runs results point complex molecule-specific photodynamics native dna may evident simpler model systems
