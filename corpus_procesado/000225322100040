experimental demonstration quantum memory light 
information carrier todays communications weak pulse light intrinsically quantum object consequence complete information pulse perfectly recorded classical memory even principle field quantum information led long-standing challenge achieve high-fidelity transfer independently prepared quantum state light onto atomic quantum state1- propose experimentally demonstrate protocol quantum memory based atomic ensembles recording externally provided quantum state light onto atomic quantum memory achieved per cent fidelity significantly higher limit classical recording quantum storage light achieved three steps: first interaction input pulse entangling field spin-polarized caesium atoms; second subsequent measurement transmitted light; third feedback onto atoms using radio-frequency magnetic pulse conditioned measurement result density recorded states per cent higher best classical recording light onto atoms quantum memory lifetime milliseconds
