apoe-directed therapeutics rapidly clear beta-amyloid reverse deficits ad mouse models 
alzheimers disease ad associated impaired clearance beta-amyloid beta brain process normally facilitated apolipoprotein e apoe apoe expression transcriptionally induced action nuclear receptors peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma liver x receptors coordination retinoid x receptors rxrs oral administration rxr agonist bexarotene mouse model ad resulted enhanced clearance soluble beta within hours apoe-dependent manner beta plaque area reduced % within just hours furthermore bexarotene stimulated rapid reversal cognitive social olfactory deficits improved neural circuit function thus rxr activation stimulates physiological beta clearance mechanisms resulting rapid reversal broad range beta-induced deficits
