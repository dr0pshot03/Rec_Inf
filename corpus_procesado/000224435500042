metal-insulator-semiconductor optoelectronic fibres 
combination conductors semiconductors insulators well-defined geometries prescribed length scales forming intimate interfaces essential functional electronic optoelectronic devices typically produced using variety elaborate wafer-based processes allow small features restricted planar geometries limited coverage area1- contrast technique fibre drawing preformed reel tube simpler yields extended lengths highly uniform fibres well-controlled geometries good optical transport characteristics4 far technique restricted particular materials5- larger features8- report design fabrication characterization fibres made conducting semiconducting insulating materials intimate contact variety geometries demonstrate approach can used construct tunable fibre photodetector comprising amorphous semiconductor core contacted metallic microwires surrounded cylindrical-shell resonant optical cavity fibre sensitive illumination along entire length tens meters thus forming photodetecting element dimensionality one also construct grid fibres can identify location illumination point advantage type photodetector array needs number elements order n contrast conventional order n2 detector arrays made photodetecting elements dimensionality zero
