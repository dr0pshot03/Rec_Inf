topology links rna secondary structure global conformation dynamics adaptation
thermodynamic rules link rna sequences secondary structure well established link secondary structure three-dimensional global conformation remains poorly understood constructed comprehensive three-dimensional maps depicting orientation a-form helices across rna junctions protein data bank rationalized findings modeling nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy show secondary structures junctions encode readily computable topological constraints accurately predict three-dimensional orientation helices across two-way junctions results suggest rna global conformation largely defined topological constraints encoded secondary structural level tertiary contacts intermolecular interactions serve stabilize specific conformers within topologically allowed ensemble
