vivo cardiac reprogramming contributes zebrafish heart regeneration 
despite current treatment regimens heart failure remains leading cause morbidity mortality developed world due limited capacity adult mammalian ventricular cardiomyocytes divide replace ventricular myocardium lost ischaemia-induced infarct hence great interest identify potential cellular sources strategies generate new ventricular myocardium past studies shown fish amphibians early postnatal mammalian ventricular cardiomyocytes can proliferate help regenerate injured ventricles- however recent studies suggested additional endogenous cellular sources may contribute overall ventricular regeneration developed zebrafish danio rerio combination fluorescent reporter transgenes genetic fate-mapping strategies ventricle-specific genetic ablation system discover differentiated atrial cardiomyocytes can transdifferentiate ventricular cardiomyocytes contribute zebrafish cardiac ventricular regeneration using vivo time-lapse confocal imaging monitored dynamic cellular events atrial-to-ventricular cardiomyocyte transdifferentiation define intermediate cardiac reprogramming stages observed notch signalling becomes activated atrial endocardium following ventricular ablation discovered inhibiting notch signalling blocked atrial-to-ventricular transdifferentiation cardiac regeneration overall studies provide evidence plasticity cardiac lineages myocardial injury importantly reveal abundant new potential cardiac resident cellular source cardiac ventricular regeneration
