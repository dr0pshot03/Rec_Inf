prospects detecting supersymmetric dark matter galactic halo
dark matter dominant form matter universe nature unknown plausibly elementary particle perhaps lightest supersymmetric partner known particle species case annihilation dark matter halo milky way produce gamma-rays level may soon observable previous work argued annihilation signal will dominated emission small clumps perhaps smaller even earth easily detected cluster together dark matter haloes dwarf satellite galaxies report small scale structure will fact negligible impact dark matter detectability rather dominant probably easily detectable signal will produced diffuse dark matter main halo milkyway main halo strongly detected small dark matter clumps also visible may well contain stars thereby confirming key prediction cold dark matter model
