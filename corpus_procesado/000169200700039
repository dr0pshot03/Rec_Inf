structural basis transcription: rna polymerase ii angstrom ngstrom resolution
structures subunit yeast rna polymerase ii derived two crystal forms angstrom resolution comparison structures reveals division polymerase four mobile modules including clamp shown previously swing active center angstrom structure clamp open state allowing entry straight promoter dna initiation transcription three loops extending clamp may play roles rna unwinding dna rewinding transcription angstrom difference fourier map reveals two metal ions active site one persistently bound possibly exchangeable rna synthesis results also provide evidence rna exit vicinity carboxyl-terminal repeat domain coupling synthesis rna processing enzymes bound domain
