plasticity-driven individualization olfactory coding mushroom body output neurons 
although sensory circuits ascend higher brain areas stimuli represented sparse stimulus-specific activity patterns relatively little known sensory coding descending side neural circuits network converges insects mushroom bodies important model system studying sparse coding olfactory system- format important accurate memory formation- drosophila recently shown kenyon cells mushroom body converge onto population mushroom body output neurons mbons fall anatomically distinct cell types provide first knowledge comprehensive view olfactory representations fourth layer circuit find clear transition principles sensory coding show mbon tuning curves highly correlated one another sharp contrast process progressive decorrelation tuning earlier layers circuit instead population level odour representations reformatted positive negative correlations arise representations different odours single-cell level show uniquely identifiable mbons display profoundly different tuning across different animals tuning neuron across two hemispheres individual fly nearly identical thus individualized coordination tuning arises level olfactory circuit furthermore find individualization active process requires learning-related gene rutabaga ultimately neural circuits flexibly map highly stimulus-specific information sparse layers onto limited number different motor outputs reformatting sensory representations observe may mark beginning sensory-motor transition olfactory system
