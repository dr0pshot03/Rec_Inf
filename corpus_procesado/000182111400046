exocyst complex required targeting glut4 plasma membrane insulin 
insulin stimulates glucose transport promoting exocytosis glucose transporter glut4 refs dynamic processes involved trafficking glut4-containing vesicles targeting docking fusion plasma membrane well signalling processes govern events well understood recently described tyrosine-phosphorylation events restricted subdomains plasma membrane result activation g protein tc10 refs show tc10 interacts one components exocyst complex exo70 exo70 translocates plasma membrane response insulin activation tc10 assembles multiprotein complex includes sec6 sec8 overexpression exo70 mutant blocked insulin-stimulated glucose uptake trafficking glut4 plasma membrane however mutant block extracellular exposure glut4 protein exocyst might crucial role targeting glut4 vesicle plasma membrane perhaps directing vesicle precise site fusion
