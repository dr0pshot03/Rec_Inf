single neurons prefrontal cortex encode abstract rules 
ability abstract principles rules direct experience allows behaviour extend beyond specific circumstances general situations example learn rules restaurant dining specific experiences can apply new restaurants use rules thought depend prefrontal cortex pfc damage often results difficulty following rules explore neural basis recording single neurons pfc monkeys trained use two abstract rules required indicate whether two successively presented pictures different depending rule currently effect monkeys performed task new pictures thus showing learned two general principles applied stimuli yet experienced prevalent neuronal activity observed pfc reflected coding abstract rules
