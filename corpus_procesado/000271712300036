phase transformation generally begins nucleation small aggregate atoms organizes different structural symmetry thermodynamic driving forces kinetic rates predicted classical nucleation theory observation nanometer-scale nuclei possible except exposed surfaces used statistical technique called fluctuation transmission electron microscopy detect nuclei embedded glassy solid used laser pump-probe technique determine role nuclei crystallization study provides convincing proof time temperature-dependent development nuclei information will play critical role development advanced materials phase-change memories
