increased proteasome activity human embryonic stem cells regulated psmd11 
embryonic stem cells can replicate continuously absence senescence therefore immortal culture although genome stability essential survival stem cells proteome stability may equally important role stem-cell identity function furthermore asymmetric divisions invoked stem cells passage damaged proteins daughter cells potentially destroy resulting lineage cells therefore firm understanding stem cells maintain proteome central importance show human embryonic stem cells hescs exhibit high proteasome activity correlated increased levels 19s proteasome subunit psmd11 known rpn caenorhabditis elegans- corresponding increased assembly 26s/30s proteasome ectopic expression psmd11 sufficient increase proteasome assembly activity foxo4 insulin/insulin-like growth factor-i igf-i responsive transcription factor associated long lifespan invertebrates regulates proteasome activity modulating expression psmd11 hescs proteasome inhibition hescs affects expression pluripotency markers levels specific markers distinct germ layers results suggest new regulation proteostasis hescs links longevity stress resistance invertebrates hesc function identity
