mechanistic considerations halogenating enzymes
nature halogenation strategy used increase biological activity secondary metabolites compounds often effective drugs however halides particularly reactive unless activated typically oxidation pace discovery new enzymes halogenation increasing revealing new metalloenzymes flavoenzymes s-adenosyl-l-methionine sam-dependent enzymes others catalyse halide oxidation using dioxygen hydrogen peroxide hydroperoxides promote nucleophilic halide addition reactions
