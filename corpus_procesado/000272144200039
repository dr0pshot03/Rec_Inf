two-dimensional normal-state quantum oscillations superconducting heterostructure 
semiconductor heterostructures provide ideal platform studying high-mobility low-density electrons reduced dimensions- realization superconductivity heavily doped diamond silicon silicon carbide germanium suggests cooper pairs eventually may directly incorporated semiconductor heterostructures newly discovered superconductors currently limited extremely large electronic disorder similarly electron mean free path low-dimensional superconducting thin films usually limited interface scattering single-crystal polycrystalline samples atomic-scale disorder amorphous materials confining examples extreme dirty limit report fabrication high-quality superconducting layer within thin-film heterostructure based srtio first known superconducting semiconductor selectively doping narrow region srtio electron-donor niobium form superconductor two-dimensional probed anisotropy upper critical magnetic field unlike previous examples however electron mobility high enough normal state resistance exhibits shubnikov-de haas oscillations scale perpendicular field indicating two-dimensional states results suggest delta-doped srtio provides model system explore quantum transport interplay superconducting normal electrons also demonstrate high-quality complex oxide heterostructures can maintain electron coherence macroscopic scales probed transport well microscopic scales demonstrated previously
