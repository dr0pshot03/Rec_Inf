spin-torque diode effect magnetic tunnel junctions
currently much interest development spin-tronic devices harnessing spins electrons rather just charges anticipated provide new functionalities go beyond possible conventional electronic devices one widely studied example effect roots electrons spin degree freedom torque exerted spin-polarized electric current spin moment nanometre-scale magnet torque causes magnetic moment rotate- potentially useful frequencies report different phenomenon also based interplay spin dynamics spin-dependent transport arises unusual diode behaviour show application small radio-frequency alternating current nanometre-scale magnetic tunnel junction- can generate measurable direct-current dc voltage across device frequency resonant spin oscillations arise spin-torque effect: resonance can tuned external magnetic field structure exhibits different resistance states depending direction current behaviour markedly different conventional semiconductor diode form basis nanometre-scale radio-frequency detector telecommunication circuits
