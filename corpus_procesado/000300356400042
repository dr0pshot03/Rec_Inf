rna editing underlies temperature adaptation k+ channels polar octopuses 
operate extreme cold ion channels psychrophiles must evolved structural changes compensate thermal environment reasonable assumption underlying adaptations lie within encoding genes show delayed rectifier k+ channel genes antarctic tropical octopus encode channels differ four positions display similar behavior expressed xenopus oocytes however transcribed messenger rnas extensively edited creating functional diversity one editing site recodes isoleucine valine channels pore greatly accelerates gating kinetics destabilizing open state site extensively edited antarctic arctic species mostly unedited tropical species thus adenosine-to-inosine rna editing can respond physical environment
