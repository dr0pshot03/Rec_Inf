recent expansion toxoplasma enhanced oral transmission 
global predominance three clonal toxoplasma gondii lineages suggests endowed exceptional trait responsible current parasitism nearly warm-blooded vertebrates genetic polymorphism analyses indicate clonal lineages emerged within last years single genetic cross comparison ancient strains similar to1 million years suggests success clonal lineages resulted concurrent acquisition direct oral infectivity key adaptation circumvented sexual recombination simultaneously promoting transmission successive hosts hence leading clonal expansion thus changes complex life cycles can occur rapidly can profoundly influence pathogenicity
