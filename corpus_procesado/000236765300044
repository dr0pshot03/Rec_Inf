diels-alder aqueous molecular hosts: unusual regioselectivity efficient catalysis 
self-assembled hollow molecular structures appealing synthetic hosts mediating chemical reactions however product binding inhibited catalytic turnover systems selectivity rarely approached levels observed structurally elaborate natural enzymes found aqueous organopalladium cage induces highly unusual regioselectivity diels-alder coupling anthracene phthalimide guests promoting reaction terminal rather central anthracene ring moreover similar bowl-shaped host attains efficient catalytic turnover coupling substrates although conventional regiochemistry likely product geometry inhibits aromatic stacking interactions attract planar reagents host
