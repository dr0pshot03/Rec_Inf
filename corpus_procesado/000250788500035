wave nature particles rarely observed part short de broglie wavelengths situations however even wavelengths close size surroundings particles couple environment example gravity coulomb interaction thermal radiation couplings shift wave phases often uncontrolled way resulting decoherence loss phase integrity thought main cause transition quantum classical behavior much interaction needed induce transition show photoelectron two protons form minimum particle/ slit system single additional electron constitutes minimum environment interference fringes observed angular distribution single electron lost coulomb interaction second electron though correlated momenta entangled electron pair continue exhibit quantum interference
