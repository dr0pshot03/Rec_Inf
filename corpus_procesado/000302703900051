ribosome profiling shows mir- reduces translation causing mrna decay zebrafish 
micrornas regulate gene expression deadenylation repression messenger rna mrna decay however contribution mechanism non-steady-state situations remains unclear monitored impact mir- ribosome occupancy endogenous mrnas wild-type dicer mutant zebrafish embryos found mir- reduces number ribosomes target mrnas causing mrna decay translational repression occurs complete deadenylation disrupting deadenylation use internal polyadenylate tail block target repression lastly observed ribosome density along length message remains constant suggesting translational repression occurs reducing rate initiation rather affecting elongation causing ribosomal drop-off results show mir- regulates translation initiation inducing mrna decay zebrafish development
