decreased stability methane hydrates marine sediments owing phase-boundary roughness
water depths metres pressure temperature conditions cause methane form ice-like crystals methane hydrate marine deposits methane hydrate estimated large amassing gigatonnes carbon thought important global change seafloor stability well representing potentially exploitable energy resource extent deposits can usually inferred seismic imaging base methane hydrate stability zone frequently identifiable smooth reflector runs parallel sea floor using high-resolution seismic sections seafloor sediments cascadia margin coast vancouver island canada observe lateral variations base hydrate stability zone including gas-rich vertical intrusions hydrate stability zone suggest vertical intrusions associated upward flow warmer fluids therefore seafloor fluid expulsion methane hydrate deposits coincide base hydrate stability zone might exhibit significant roughness increased surface area increased area implies significantly methane hydrate lies close unstable hence closer dissociation event lowering pressure due sea-level fall
