stability body-centred-cubic phase iron earths inner core
iron thought main constituent earths core considerable efforts- therefore made understand properties high pressure temperature efforts expanded knowledge iron phase diagram remain significant inconsistencies notable difference low high melting curves report results molecular dynamics simulations iron based embedded atom models fitted results two implementations density functional theory tested two model approximations found point stability body-centred-cubic bcc iron phase high temperature pressure calculated melting curve agreement high melting curve calculated phase boundary hexagonal close packed h c p bcc iron phases good agreement low melting curve suggest hcp-bcc transition previously misinterpreted melting transition similar case xenon- bcc phase iron stable phase earths inner core
