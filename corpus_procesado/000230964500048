normal mammalian cells finite lifespan thought constitute protective mechanism unlimited proliferation- phenomenon called senescence driven telomere attrition triggers induction tumour suppressors including p16ink4a ref cultured cells senescence can elicited prematurely oncogenes however whether oncogene-induced senescence represents physiological process long debated human naevi moles benign tumours melanocytes frequently harbour oncogenic mutations predominantly v600e valine substituted glutamic acid braf protein kinase downstream effector ras nonetheless naevi typically remain growth-arrested state decades rarely progress malignancy melanoma- raises question whether naevi undergo brafv600e induced senescence show sustained brafv600e expression human melanocytes induces cell cycle arrest accompanied induction p16ink4a senescence associated acidic beta-galactosidase sa-beta-gal activity commonly used senescence marker validating results vivo congenital naevi invariably positive sa-beta-gal demonstrating presence classical senescence-associated marker largely growth-arrested neoplastic human lesion growth-arrested melanocytes vitro situ observed marked mosaic induction p16ink4a suggesting factors p16ink4a contribute protection brafv600e driven proliferation naevi appear suffer telomere attrition arguing favour active oncogene-driven senescence process rather loss replicative potential thus vitro vivo brafv600e-expressing melanocytes display classical hallmarks senescence suggesting oncogene-induced senescence represents genuine protective physiological process
