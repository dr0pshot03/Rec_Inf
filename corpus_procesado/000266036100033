select drosophila glomeruli mediate innate olfactory attraction aversion
fruitflies show robust attraction food odours usually excite several glomeruli understand representation odours leads behaviour used genetic tools dissect contribution activated glomerulus apple cider vinegar triggers robust innate attraction relatively low concentration activates six glomeruli silencing individual glomeruli show absence activity two glomeruli dm1 va2 markedly reduces attraction conversely two glomeruli selectively activated flies showed robust attraction vinegar wild-type flies notably higher concentration vinegar excites additional glomerulus less attractive flies show activation extra glomerulus necessary sufficient mediate behavioural switch together results indicate individual glomeruli rather entire pattern active glomeruli mediate innate behavioural output
