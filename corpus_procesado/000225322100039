building blocks planets within terrestrial region protoplanetary disks 
solar system formed cloud gas dust dust mass contained amorphous silicates yet crystalline silicates abundant throughout solar system reflecting thermal chemical alteration solids planet formation even primitive bodies comets contain crystalline silicates little known evolution dust forms earth-like planets report spatially resolved detections compositional analyses building blocks innermost two astronomical units three proto-planetary disks find dust regions highly crystallized dust observed young stars now addition outer region one star equal amounts pyroxene olivine whereas inner regions dominated olivine spectral shape inner-disk spectra shows surprising similarity solar system comets radial-mixing models naturally explain resemblance well gradient chemical composition observations imply silicates crystallize terrestrial planets formed consistent composition meteorites solar system
