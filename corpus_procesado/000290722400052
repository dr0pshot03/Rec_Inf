dual functions tet1 transcriptional regulation mouse embryonic stem cells 
epigenetic modification mammalian genome dna methylation -methylcytosine profound impact chromatin structure gene expression maintenance cellular identity recent demonstration members ten-eleven translocation tet family proteins can convert methylcytosine hydroxymethylcytosine raised possibility tet proteins capable establishing distinct epigenetic state recently demonstrated tet1 specifically expressed murine embryonic stem es cells required es cell maintenance using chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled high-throughput dna sequencing show mouse es cells tet1 preferentially bound cpg-rich sequences promoters transcriptionally active polycomb-repressed genes despite increase levels dna methylation many tet1-binding sites tet1 depletion lead downregulation tet1 targets interestingly although tet1-mediated promoter hypomethylation required maintaining expression group transcriptionally active genes also involved repression polycomb-targeted developmental regulators tet1 contributes silencing group genes facilitating recruitment prc2 cpg-rich gene promoters thus study establishes role tet1 modulating dna methylation levels cpg-rich promoters also reveals dual function tet1 promoting transcription pluripotency factors well participating repression polycomb-targeted developmental regulators
