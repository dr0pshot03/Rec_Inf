protein structure determination living cells in-cell nmr spectroscopy
investigating proteins work living environment atomic resolution major goal molecular biology achieved even though methods three-dimensional 3d structure determination purified proteins single crystals solution widely used recent developments nmr hardware methodology enabled measurement high-resolution heteronuclear multi-dimensional nmr spectra macromolecules living cells in-cell nmr- various intracellular events conformational changes dynamics binding events investigated method however low sensitivity short lifetime samples far prevented acquisition sufficient structural information determine protein structures in-cell nmr show first knowledge 3d protein structure calculated exclusively basis information obtained living cells structure putative heavy-metal binding protein ttha1718 thermus thermophilus hb8 overexpressed escherichia coli cells solved in-cell nmr rapid measurement 3d nmr spectra nonlinear sampling indirectly acquired dimensions used overcome problems caused instability low sensitivity living e coli samples almost expected backbone nmr resonances side-chain nmr resonances observed assigned enabling high quality angstrom backbone root mean squared deviation structures calculated similar vitro structure ttha1718 determined independently in-cell nmr approach can thus provide accurate high-resolution structures proteins living environments
