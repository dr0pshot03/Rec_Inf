near-unity photoluminescence quantum yield mos2
two-dimensional 2d transition metal dichalcogenides emerged promising material system optoelectronic applications primary figure merit room-temperature photoluminescence quantum yield qy extremely low prototypical 2d material molybdenum disulfide mos2 reported maximum qy % indicates considerable defect density herewe report air-stable solution-based chemical treatment organic superacid uniformly enhances photoluminescence minority carrier lifetime mos2 monolayers two orders magnitude treatment eliminates defect-mediated nonradiative recombination thus resulting final qy % longest-observed lifetime nanoseconds ability obtain optoelectronic monolayers near-perfect properties opens door development highly efficient light-emitting diodes lasers solar cells based 2d materials
