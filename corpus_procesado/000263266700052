stress-responsive rna switch regulates vegfa expression
ligand binding structural elements non coding regions messenger rna modulates gene expression ligands free metabolites small molecules directly bind induce conformational changes regulatory rna elements known riboswitches- types rna switches activated complexed metabolites example rna ligated metabolites aminoacyl charged transfer rna t box system protein-bound metabolites glucose amino acid stimulated terminator-anti terminator systems switch types found bacteria fungi plants- report rna switch human vascular endothelial growth factor vegfa also known vegf mrna untranslated region utr integrates signals interferon ifn-gamma hypoxia regulate vegfa translation myeloid cells analogous riboswitches vegfa utr undergoes binary conformational change response environmental signals however vegfa utr switch metabolite independent conformational change dictated mutually exclusive stimulus dependent binding proteins namely ifn-gamma-activated inhibitor translation complex heterogeneous
