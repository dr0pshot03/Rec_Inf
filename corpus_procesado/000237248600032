metallic transport polyaniline 
despite nearly three decades materials development transport properties metallic state so-called conducting polymers still typical conventional metals1- hallmark metallic resistivity-a monotonic decrease resistivity temperature-has obtained temperatures full range room temperature; frequency dependent conductivity sigmaomega typical metals also observed contrast low-temperature behaviour metallic polymers previous cases exhibited increase resistivity temperature decreased result disorder-induced localization charge carriers1- disorder-induced localization also changes infrared response sigmaomega deviates prediction drude theory5- report classic metallic transport data obtained truly metallic polymers polyaniline samples prepared using self-stabilized dispersion polymerization8 find samples room-temperature conductivities excess s cm- resistivity decreases monotonically temperature lowered k infrared spectra characteristic conventional drude model even lowest frequencies measured
