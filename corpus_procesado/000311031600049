serine natural ligand allosteric activator pyruvate kinase m2 
cancer cells exhibit several unique metabolic phenotypes critical cell growth proliferation1 specifically overexpress m2 isoform tightly regulated enzyme pyruvate kinase pkm2 controls glycolytic flux highly dependent de novo biosynthesis serine glycine2 describe new rheostat-like mechanistic relationship pkm2 activity serine biosynthesis show serine can bind activate human pkm2 pkm2 activity cells reduced response serine deprivation reduction pkm2 activity shifts cells fuel-efficient mode pyruvate diverted mitochondria glucose-derived carbon channelled serine biosynthesis support cell proliferation
