common regulatory variation impacts gene expression cell type-dependent manner 
studies correlating genetic variation gene expression facilitate interpretation common human phenotypes disease functional variants may operating tissue-dependent manner performed gene expression profiling association genetic variants single-nucleotide polymorphisms three cell types individuals detected cell type-specific genetic effects % regulatory variants operating cell type-specific manner identified multiple expressive quantitative trait loci eqtls per gene unique shared among cell types positively correlated number transcripts per gene cell type-specific eqtls found larger distances genes lower effect size similar known enhancers data suggest complete regulatory variant repertoire can uncovered context cell-type specificity
