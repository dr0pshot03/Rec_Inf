porphyry-copper ore shells form stable pressure-temperature fronts within dynamic fluid plumes 
porphyry-type ore deposits major resources copper gold precipitated fluids expelled crustal magma chambers metals typically concentrated confined ore shells within vertically extensive vein networks formed hydraulic fracturing rock ascending fluids numerical modeling shows dynamic permeability responses magmatic fluid expulsion can stabilize front metal precipitation boundary lithostatically pressured up-flow hot magmatic fluids hydrostatically pressured convection cooler meteoric fluids balance focused heat advection lateral cooling controls important economic characteristics including size shape ore grade self-sustaining process may extend epithermal gold deposits venting active volcanoes regions potential geothermal energy production
