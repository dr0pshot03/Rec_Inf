reproductive isolation caused colour pattern mimicry 
speciation facilitated ecological adaptation directly causes assortative mating1 natural examples known show shift colour pattern mimicry crucial origin two butterfly species sister species heliconius melpomene heliconius cydno recently diverged mimic different model taxa experiments show mimetic coloration also important choosing mates assortative mating sister species means hybridization rare nature hybrids produced nonmimetic poorly adapted intermediates thus mimetic shift caused pre-mating post-mating isolation addition individuals population h melpomene allopatric h cydno court mate h cydno readily sympatric population suggests assortative mating enhanced sympatry
