photoredox activation direct beta-arylation ketones aldehydes
direct beta-activation saturated aldehydes ketones long elusive transformation found photoredox catalysis combination organocatalysis can lead transient generation pi-electron beta-enaminyl radicals ketones aldehydes rapidly couple cyano-substituted aryl rings carbonyl beta-position mode activation suitable broad range carbonyl beta-functionalization reactions amenable enantioselective catalysis
