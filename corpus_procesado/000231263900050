global hotspots species richness congruent endemism threat 
biodiversity hotspots prominent role conservation biology- remains controversial extent different types hotspot congruent- previous studies unable provide general answer used single biodiversity index geographically restricted compared areas unequal size quantitatively compare hotspot types-- use new global database breeding distribution known extant bird species test congruence across three types hotspot demonstrate hotspots species richness threat endemism show geographical distribution % hotspot areas common three aspects diversity % hotspots idiosyncratic generally surprisingly low overall congruence biodiversity indices one index explaining less % variation indices results suggest even within single taxonomic class different mechanisms responsible origin maintenance different aspects diversity consequently different types hotspots also vary greatly utility conservation tools
