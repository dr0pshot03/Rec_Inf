niche conservatism-the tendency closely related species ecologically similar widespread- however studies compare closely related taxa occur allopatry sympatry stabilizing forces promote niche conservatism thus inhibit niche shifts may countered natural selection favouring ecological divergence minimize intensity interspecific interactions consequently relative importance niche conservatism versus niche divergence determining community structure received little attention examine tropical lizard community species long evolutionary history ecological interaction find evolutionary divergence overcomes niche conservatism: closely related species ecologically similar expected random divergence distantly related species ecologically similar leading community relationship ecological similarity phylogenetic relatedness weak despite lack niche conservatism ecological structuring community phylogenetic component: niche complementarity occurs among distantly related species suggests strength ecological interactions among species may related phylogeny necessarily closely related species interact strongly
