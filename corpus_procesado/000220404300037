mass volume contributions twentieth-century global sea level rise
rate twentieth-century global sea level rise causes subjects intense controversy- direct estimates tide gauges give - mm yr- whereas indirect estimates based two processes responsible global sea level rise namely mass volume change fall far range estimates volume increase due ocean warming give rate mm yr- ref rate due mass increase primarily melting continental ice thought even smaller therefore either tide gauge estimates high suggested recently one mass volume estimates low present analysis sea level measurements tide gauges combined observations temperature salinity pacific atlantic oceans close gauges find gauge-determined rates sea level rise encompass mass volume changes two three times higher rates due volume change derived temperature salinity data analysis supports earlier studies put twentieth-century rate - mm yr- range importantly suggests mass increase plays larger role ocean warming twentieth-century global sea level rise
