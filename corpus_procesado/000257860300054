imbalance psmad3 notch induces cdk inhibitors old muscle stem cells
adult skeletal muscle robustly regenerates throughout organisms life muscle ages ability repair diminishes eventually fails previous work suggests regenerative potential muscle stem cells satellite cells triggered old muscle decline notch activation can rejuvenated forced local activation notch report addition loss notch activation old muscle produces excessive transforming growth factor tgf-beta myostatin induces unusually high levels tgf-beta psmad3 resident satellite cells interferes regenerative capacity importantly endogenous notch psmad3 antagonize control satellite-cell proliferation activation notch blocks tgf-beta-dependent upregulation cyclin-dependent kinase cdk inhibitors p15 p16 p21 p27 whereas inhibition notch induces furthermore muscle stem cells notch activity determines binding psmad3 promoters negative regulators cell-cycle progression attenuation tgf-beta/psmad3 old injured muscle restores regeneration satellite cells vivo thus balance endogenous psmad3 active notch controls regenerative competence muscle stem cells deregulation balance old muscle microniche interferes regeneration
