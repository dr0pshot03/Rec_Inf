balanced inhibition underlies tuning sharpens spike timing auditory cortex
neurons primary auditory cortex tuned intensity specific frequencies sounds synaptic mechanisms underlying tuning remain uncertain inhibition seems functional role formation cortical receptive fields stimuli often suppress similar neighbouring responses- pharmacological blockade inhibition broadens tuning curves use whole-cell recordings vivo disentangle roles excitatory inhibitory activity tone-evoked responses single neurons auditory cortex excitatory inhibitory receptive fields cover almost exactly areas contrast predictions classical lateral inhibition models thus although inhibition typically strong excitation necessary establish tuning even receptive field surround however inhibition excitation occurred precise stereotyped temporal sequence: initial barrage excitatory input rapidly quenched inhibition truncating spiking response within - milliseconds balanced inhibition might thus serve increase temporal precision thereby reduce randomness cortical operation rather increase noise proposed previously
