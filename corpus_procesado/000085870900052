attention modulates synchronized neuronal firing primate somatosensory cortex 
potentially powerful information processing strategy brain take advantage thetemporal structure neuronal spike trains increase synchrony within neural representation object location increases efficacy neural representation next synaptic stage brain thus increasing synchrony candidate neural correlate attentional selection investigated synchronous firing pairs neurons secondary somatosensory cortex sii three monkeys trained switch attention visual task tactile discrimination task found neuron pairs sii cortex fired synchronously furthermore degree synchrony affected monkeys attentional state monkey performing difficult task % neuron pairs fired synchronously changed degree synchrony monkey switched attention tactile visual tasks synchrony increased % decreased % neuron pairs affected attention
