evolution alternative parasitic life histories large blue butterflies 
large blue maculinea butterflies highly endangered throughout palaearctic region focus intense conservation research1- addition extraordinary parasitic lifestyles make ideal studies life history evolution early instars consume flower buds specific host plants later instars live ant nests either devour brood predators fed mouth-to-mouth adult ants cuckoos present phylogeny group shows monophyletic clade nested within phengaris rare oriental genus whose species similar life histories45 cuckoo species likely evolved predatory ancestors early five million years ago two maculinea clades diverged leading different parasitic strategies seen genus today contrary current belief two recognized cuckoo species show little genetic divergence probably single ecologically differentiated species6- hand predatory morphospecies exhibit considerable genetic divergence may contain cryptic species findings important implications conservation reintroduction efforts
