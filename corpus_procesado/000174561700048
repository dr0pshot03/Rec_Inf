common rule scaling carnivore density
population density plants animals thought scale size result mass-related energy requirements variation resources however naturally limits population density may alter expected scaling patterns develop test general model variation within species population density across order carnivora find kilograms prey supports kilograms given species carnivore irrespective body mass ratio carnivore number prey biomass scales reciprocal carnivore mass using mass-specific equations prey productivity show carnivore number per unit prey productivity scales carnivore mass near scaling rule can predict population density across three orders magnitude relationship provides basis identifying declining carnivore species require conservation measures
