odorant receptor-derived camp signals direct axonal targeting 
mammals odorant receptors ors direct axons olfactory sensory neurons osns toward targets olfactory bulb show cyclic adenosine monophosphate camp signals regulate expression axon guidance molecules essential or-instructed axonal projection genetic manipulations ors stimulatory g protein camp-dependent protein kinase camp response element binding protein shifted axonal projection sites along anterior-posterior axis olfactory bulb thus or-derived camp signals rather direct action molecules determine target destinations osns
