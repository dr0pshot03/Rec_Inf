foxg1 suppresses early cortical cell fate 
mammalian cerebral corticogenesis progenitor cells become progressively restricted types neurons can produce molecular mechanism determines earlier versus later born neuron fate unknown demonstrate generation earliest born neurons cajal-retzius cells suppressed telencephalic transcription factor foxg1 foxg1 null mutants observed excess cajal-retzius neuron production cortex conditionally inactivating foxg1 cortical progenitors normally produce deep-layer cortical neurons demonstrate foxg1 constitutively required suppress cajal-retzius cell fate hence competence generate earliest born neurons later cortical development actively suppressed lost
