cell type regulates selective segregation mouse chromosome dna strands mitosis 
chromosome replication sister chromatid copies generally thought segregate randomly daughter cells however sister chromatids differ dna strands chromatid inheriting one older strand paired newly synthesized strand genetic analysis homologous chromosome pair indicated nonrandom chromatid distribution embryonic stem cells biased segregation pattern also found endoderm cells examined neuroectoderm cells contrast mesoderm cardiomyocyte pancreatic cells exhibited random mode segregation strand distribution mechanisms regulated cell type may consequences cellular differentiation evolving strategies developmental mechanisms
