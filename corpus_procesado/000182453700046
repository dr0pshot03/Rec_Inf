reversing inactivation peroxiredoxins caused cysteine sulfinic acid formation
active-site cysteine peroxiredoxins selectively oxidized cysteine sulfinic acid catalysis leads inactivation peroxidase activity oxidation thought irreversible however metabolic labeling mammalian cells s- show sulfinic form peroxiredoxin produced exposure cells h2o2 rapidly reduced catalytically active thiol form mammalian cells ability reduce protein sulfinic acid might serve mechanism repair oxidatively damaged proteins represent new type cyclic modification function various proteins regulated
