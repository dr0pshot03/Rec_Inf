nanoparticle superlattice engineering dna
current limitation nanoparticle superlattice engineering identities particles assembled often determine structures can synthesized therefore specific crystallographic symmetries lattice parameters can achieved using specific nanoparticles building blocks vice versa present six design rules can used deliberately prepare nine distinct colloidal crystal structures control lattice parameters nanometer length scale design rules outline strategy independently adjust relevant crystallographic parameters including particle size nanometers periodicity interparticle distance work represents advance synthesizing tailorable macroscale architectures comprising nanoscale materials predictable fashion
