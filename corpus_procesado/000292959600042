dinosaur body temperatures determined isotopic c--o- ordering fossil biominerals
nature physiology thermal regulation nonavian dinosaurs subject debate previously arguments made endothermic ectothermic metabolisms basis differing methodologies used clumped isotope thermometry determine body temperatures fossilized teeth large jurassic sauropods data indicate body temperatures degrees degrees c similar modern mammals temperature range degrees degrees c lower predicted model showed scaling dinosaur body temperature mass indicate sauropods mechanisms prevent excessively high body temperatures reached gigantic size
