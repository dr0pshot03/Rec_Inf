asynchronous state cortical circuits
correlated spiking often observed cortical circuits functional role controversial believed correlations consequence shared inputs nearby neurons severely constrain information decoding show theoretically recurrent neural networks can generate asynchronous state characterized arbitrarily low mean spiking correlations despite substantial amounts shared input state spontaneous fluctuations activity excitatory inhibitory populations accurately track generating negative correlations synaptic currents cancel effect shared input near-zero mean correlations seen experimentally recordings rodent neocortex vivo results suggest reexamination sources underlying observed correlations functional consequences information processing
