spontaneous droplet trampolining rigid superhydrophobic surfaces 
spontaneous removal condensed matter surfaces exploited nature broad range technologies achieve self-cleaning anti-icing- condensation control despite much progress-- understanding phenomena leading behaviour remains incomplete makes challenging rationally design surfaces benefit manifestation- show water droplets resting superhydrophobic textured surfaces low-pressure environment can self-remove sudden spontaneous levitation subsequent trampoline-like bouncing behaviour sequential collisions surface accelerate droplets collisions restitution coefficients ratios relative speeds collision greater unity despite complete rigidity surface thus seemingly violate second law thermodynamics however restitution coefficients result overpressure beneath droplet produced fast droplet vaporization substrate adhesion surface texture restrict vapour flow also show high vaporization rates experienced droplets associated cooling can result freezing supercooled state triggers sudden increase vaporization turn boosts levitation process effect can spontaneously remove surface icing lifting away icy drops moment freeze although observations relevant systems low-pressure environment show surface texturing can produce droplet-surface interactions prohibit liquid freezing water-droplet retention surfaces
