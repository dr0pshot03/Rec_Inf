tonks-girardeau gas ultracold atoms optical lattice 
strongly correlated quantum systems among intriguing fundamental systems physics one example tonks-girardeau gas proposed years ago now lacking experimental realization gas repulsive interactions bosonic particles confined one dimension dominate physics system order minimize mutual repulsion bosons prevented occupying position space mimics pauli exclusion principle fermions causing bosonic particles exhibit fermionic properties however bosons exhibit completely ideal fermionic bosonic quantum behaviour example reflected characteristic momentum distribution report preparation tonks-girardeau gas ultracold rubidium atoms held two-dimensional optical lattice formed two orthogonal standing waves addition third shallower lattice potential along long axis quantum gases allows us enter tonks-girardeau regime increasing atoms effective mass thereby enhancing role interactions make theoretical prediction momentum distribution based approach trapped bosons acquire fermionic properties finding agrees closely measured distribution
