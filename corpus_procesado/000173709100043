unsuspected diversity among marine aerobic anoxygenic phototrophs 
aerobic anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria containing bacteriochlorophyll bchla require oxygen growth bchla synthesis1- recent reports suggest bacteria widely distributed marine plankton may account % surface ocean photosynthetic electron transport % total microbial community8 known planktonic anoxygenic phototrophs belong restricted groups within proteobacteria a-subclass report genomic analyses photosynthetic gene content operon organization naturally occurring marine bacteria photosynthetic gene clusters included closely resembled proteobacteria beta-subclass never observed marine environments furthermore photosynthetic genes broadly distributed marine plankton actively expressed neritic bacterioplankton assemblages indicating newly identified phototrophs photosynthetically competent data demonstrate planktonic bacterial assemblages simply composed one uniform widespread class anoxygenic phototrophs previously proposed8; rather assemblages contain multiple distantly related photosynthetically active bacterial groups including unrelated known cultivated types
