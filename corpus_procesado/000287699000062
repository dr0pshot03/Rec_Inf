developmental role agouti color pattern evolution 
animal color patterns can affect fitness wild however little known mechanisms control formation subsequent evolution took advantage two locally camouflaged populations peromyscus mice show negative regulator adult pigmentation agouti also plays key developmental role color pattern evolution genetic functional analyses showed ventral-specific embryonic expression agouti establishes prepattern delaying terminal differentiation ventral melanocytes moreover skin-specific increase level spatial domain agouti expression prevents melanocyte maturation regionalized manner resulting novel adaptive color pattern thus natural selection favors late-acting tissue-specific changes embryonic agouti expression produce large changes adult color pattern
