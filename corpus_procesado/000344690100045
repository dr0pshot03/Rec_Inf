phylogenomics resolves timing pattern insect evolution 
insects speciose group animals phylogenetic relationships many major lineages remain unresolved inferred phylogeny insects protein-coding genes phylogenomic analyses nucleotide amino acid sequences site-specific nucleotide domain-specific amino acid substitution models produced statistically robust congruent results resolving previously controversial phylogenetic relationships dated origin insects early ordovician [similar million years ago ma] insect flight early devonian similar ma major extant lineages mississippian similar ma major diversification holometabolous insects early cretaceous phylogenomic study provides comprehensive reliable scaffold future comparative analyses evolutionary innovations among insects
