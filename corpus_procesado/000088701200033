calcium sensitivity glutamate release calyx-type terminal
synaptic efficacy critically depends presynaptic intracellular calcium concentration [ca2+]i measured calcium sensitivity glutamate release rat auditory brainstem synapse laser photolysis caged calcium rise [ca2+]i micromolar readily evoked release increase > micromolar depleted releasable vesicle pool < millisecond comparison action potential-evoked release suggested brief increase [ca2+]i similar micromolar sufficient reproduce physiological release pattern thus calcium sensitivity release synapse high distinction phasic delayed release less pronounced previously thought
