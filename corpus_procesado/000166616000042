dna replication-independent silencing s-cerevisiae 
saccharomyces cerevisiae silent mating loci repressed assembly heterochromatin formation heterochromatin requires cell cycle event occurs early s phase g/m phase widely assumed dna replication determine whether dna replication silent mating-type locus hmra required silencing established monitored heterochromatin formation hmra chromosome nonreplicating extrachromosomal cassette cells passed s phase cells passed s phase established silencing chromosomal hmra locus extrachromosomal hmra locus equal efficiency thus contrast prevailing view establishment silencing occurred absence passage dna replication fork near hmr locus retained cell cycle dependence
