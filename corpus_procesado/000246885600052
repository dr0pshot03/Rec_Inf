complex binding virally encoded rna regulates mitochondria-induced cell death 
human cytomegalovirus infection perturbs multiple cellular processes promote release proapoptotic stimuli consequently encodes mechanisms prevent cell death infection using rotenone potent inhibitor mitochondrial enzyme complex reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-ubiquinone oxido-reductase found human cytomegalovirus infection protected cells rotenone-induced apoptosis protection mediated -kilobase virally encoded rna beta infection beta rna interacted complex prevented relocalization essential subunit genes associated retinoid/interferon-induced mortality- response apoptotic stimuli interaction important stabilizing mitochondrial membrane potential resulted continued adenosine triphosphate production critical successful completion virus life cycle complex targeting viral rna represents refined strategy modulate metabolic viability infected host cell
