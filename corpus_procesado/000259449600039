fast optical flaring possible new galactic magnetar 
highly luminous rapid flares characteristic processes around compact objects like white dwarfs neutron stars black holes high energy regime x rays gamma-rays outbursts variabilities timescales seconds less routinely observed example gamma-ray bursts1 soft gamma-ray repeaters2 optical wavelengths flaring activity timescales observed prompt phase one exceptional gamma-ray burst3 mostly due fact outbursts strong fast flaring usually discovered high energy regime; optical follow-up observations transients use instruments integration times exceeding tens seconds therefore unable resolve fast variability show observation extremely bright rapid optical flaring galactic transient4- swift j1955096+ optical light curves phenomenologically similar high energy light curves soft gamma-ray repeaters anomalous x ray pulsars8 thought neutron stars extremely high magnetic fields magnetars suggests similar processes operation strong emission optical unlike case known magnetars
