fast optical flaring possible new galactic magnetar
highly luminous rapid flares characteristic processes around compact objects like white dwarfs neutron stars black holes high energy regime x rays gamma-rays outbursts variabilities timescales seconds less routinely observed example gamma-ray bursts soft gamma-ray repeaters optical wavelengths flaring activity timescales observed prompt phase one exceptional gamma-ray burst mostly due fact outbursts strong fast flaring usually discovered high energy regime optical follow-up observations transients use instruments integration times exceeding tens seconds therefore unable resolve fast variability show observation extremely bright rapid optical flaring galactic transient- swift j195509+ optical light curves phenomenologically similar high energy light curves soft gamma-ray repeaters anomalous x ray pulsars thought neutron stars extremely high magnetic fields magnetars suggests similar processes operation strong emission optical unlike case known magnetars
