cancer wnt signaling oncogenesis embryogenesis look outside nucleus
wnt cell-cell signaling pathway plays critical evolutionarily conserved role directing cell fates embryogenesis addition inappropriate activation wnt signal transduction pathway plays role variety human cancers many recent studies wnt signaling provided mechanistic insight dual roles focus two areas rapid advance: machinery regulates stability key signal transducer beta-catenin ii effect wnt signaling cellular targets outside nucleus actin microtubule cytoskeletons
