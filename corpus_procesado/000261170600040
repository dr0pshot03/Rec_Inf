chromosome alignment transvection antagonized condensin ii
polytene chromosome structure characteristic polyploid cells several thousands chromatids closely associated perfect alignment homologous dna sequences show drosophila condensin ii promotes disassembly polytene structure chromosomal components condensin ii also negatively regulates transvection process whereby certain alleles influenced transcriptionally via interallelic physical associations propose condensin ii restricts trans chromosomal interactions affect transcription ability spatially separate aligned interphase chromosomes
