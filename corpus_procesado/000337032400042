search majorana neutrinos first two years exo data
many extensions standard model particle physics suggest neutrinos majorana-type fermions-that neutrinos anti-particles-but assumption difficult confirm observation neutrinoless double-beta decay nu beta beta spontaneous transition may occur several candidate nuclei verify majorana nature neutrino constrain absolute scale neutrino mass spectrum recent searches carried ge gerda experiment xe kamland-zen exo enriched xenon observatory experiments established lifetime decay longer years corresponding limit neutrino mass - electronvolts report new results exo based large xe exposure represents almost fourfold increase earlier published data sets improved detector resolution revised data analysis half-life sensitivity obtain 9x10 years improvement factor previous exo results find statistically significant evidence nu beta beta decay set half-life limit 1x10 years per cent confidence level high sensitivity holds promise running exo detector future nu beta beta decay searches improved xe-based experiment nexo
