reconstructing farallon plate subduction beneath north america back late cretaceous 
using inverse mantle convection model assimilates seismic structure plate motions reconstruct farallon plate subduction back million years ago models consistent stratigraphy constrain depth dependence mantle viscosity buoyancy requiring farallon slab flat lying late cretaceous consistent geological reconstructions simulation predicts extensive zone shallow dipping subduction extended beyond flat-lying slab farther east north kilometers limited region flat subduction consistent notion subduction oceanic plateau caused slab flatten results imply seismic images current mantle provide constraints past tectonic events previously recognized
