bicycle can self-stable without gyroscopic caster effects
riderless bicycle can automatically steer recover falls common view self-steering caused gyroscopic precession front wheel wheel contact trailing like caster behind steer axis show neither effect necessary self-stability using linearized stability calculations guide built bicycle extra counter-rotating wheels canceling wheel spin angular momentum front-wheel ground-contact forward steer axis making trailing distance negative laterally disturbed rolling straight bicycle automatically recovers upright travel results show various design variables like front mass location steer axis tilt contribute stability complex interacting ways
