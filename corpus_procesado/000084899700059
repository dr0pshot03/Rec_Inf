synthetic oscillatory network transcriptional regulators 
networks interacting biomolecules carry many essential functions living cells1 design principles underlying functioning intracellular networks remain poorly understood despite intensive efforts including quantitative analysis relatively simple systems2 present complementary approach problem: design construction synthetic network implement particular function used three transcriptional repressor systems part natural biological clock3- build oscillating network termed repressilator escherichia coli network periodically induces synthesis green fluorescent protein readout state individual cells resulting oscillations typical periods hours slower cell-division cycle state oscillator transmitted generation generation artificial clock displays noisy behaviour possibly stochastic fluctuations components rational network design may lead engineering new cellular behaviours improved understanding naturally occurring networks
