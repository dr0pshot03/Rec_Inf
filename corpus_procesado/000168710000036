glia-derived acetylcholine-binding protein modulates synaptic transmission 
accumulating evidence glial cells actively modulate neuronal synaptic transmission identified glia-derived soluble acetylcholine-binding protein achbp naturally occurring analogue ligand-binding domains nicotinic acetylcholine receptors nachrs like nachrs assembles homopentamer ligand-binding characteristics typical nicotinic receptor; unlike nachrs however lacks domains form transmembrane ion channel presynaptic release acetylcholine induces secretion achbp glial secretory pathway describe molecular cellular mechanism glial cells release achbp synaptic cleft propose model actively regulate cholinergic transmission neurons central nervous system
