structural basis gate-dna recognition bending type iia topoisomerases
type ii topoisomerases disentangle dna facilitate chromosome segregation represent major class therapeutic targets although enzymes studied extensively molecular understanding dna binding lacking present structure complex dna binding cleavage core saccharomyces cerevisiae topo ii also known top2 gate dna segment structure reveals enzyme enforces degrees dna bend mechanism similar remodelling proteins integration host factor large protein conformational changes accompany dna deformation creating bipartite catalytic site positions dna backbone near reactive tyrosine coordinated magnesium ion configuration closely resembles catalytic site type ia topoisomerases reinforcing evolutionary link structurally functionally distinct enzymes binding dna facilitates opening enzyme dimerization interface providing visual evidence key step dna transport
