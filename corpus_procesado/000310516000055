trade-offs chemotactic foraging turbulent water
bacteria play indispensable role marine biogeochemistry recycling dissolved organic matter motile species can exploit small ephemeral solute patches chemotaxis thereby gain fitness advantage nonmotile competitors competition occurs turbulent environment yet turbulence generally considered inconsequential bacterial uptake contrast show turbulence affects uptake stirring nutrient patches networks thin filaments motile bacteria can readily exploit find chemotactic motility subject trade-off uptake benefit due chemotaxis cost locomotion resulting optimal swimming speed second trade-off results competing effects stirring mixing leads prediction chemotaxis optimally favored intermediate turbulence intensities
