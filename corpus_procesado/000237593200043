links annual milankovitch continuum temperature variability 
climate variability exists timescales climatic processes intimately coupled understanding variability one timescale requires understanding whole records earths surface temperature illustrate interdependence continuum variability following power-law scaling1- although specific modes interannual variability relatively well understood89 general controls continuum variability uncertain usually described purely stochastic processes10- show power-law relationships surface temperature variability scale annual milankovitch-period year cycles annual cycle corresponds scaling monthly decadal periods millennial longer periods tied milankovitch cycles thus annual milankovitch continuum temperature variability together represent response deterministic insolation forcing identification deterministic control continuum provides insight mechanisms governing interannual longer-period climate variability
