neuronal activity regulates diffusion across neck dendritic spines 
mammalian excitatory neurons dendritic spines separated dendrites thin necks diffusion across neck limits chemical electrical isolation spine found spine/dendrite diffusional coupling heterogeneous uncovered class diffusionally isolated spines barrier diffusion posed neck number diffusionally isolated spines bidirectionally regulated neuronal activity furthermore coincident synaptic activation postsynaptic action potentials rapidly restrict diffusion across neck regulation diffusional coupling provides possible mechanism determining amplitude postsynaptic potentials accumulation plasticity-inducing molecules within spine head
