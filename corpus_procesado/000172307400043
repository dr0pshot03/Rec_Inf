atr atrip: partners checkpoint signaling
checkpoint kinases atm ataxia telangiectasia mutated atr atm rad3 related transduce genomic stress signals halt cell cycle progression promote dna repair report identification atr-interacting protein atrip phosphorylated atr regulates atr expression essential component dna damage checkpoint pathway atr atrip localize intranuclear foci dna damage inhibition replication deletion atr mediated cre recombinase caused loss atr atrip expression loss dna damage checkpoint responses cell death therefore atr essential viability human somatic cells small interfering rna directed atrip caused loss atrip atr expression toss checkpoint responses dna damage thus atrip atr mutually dependent partners cell cycle checkpoint signaling pathways
