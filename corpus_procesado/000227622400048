transmembrane intracellular estrogen receptor mediates rapid cell signaling
steroid hormone estrogen regulates many functionally unrelated processes numerous tissues although traditionally thought control transcriptional activation classical nuclear estrogen receptors also initiates many rapid nongenomic signaling events w found g protein-coupled receptors characterized date gpr30 uniquely localized endoplasmic reticulum specifically bind estrogen fluorescent estrogen derivatives activating gpr30 estrogen resulted intracellular calcium mobilization synthesis phosphatidylinositol -trisphosphate nucleus thus gpr30 represents intracellular transmembrane estrogen receptor may contribute normal estrogen physiology well pathophysiology
