feedback inhibition controls spike transfer hybrid thalamic circuits
sensory information reaches cerebral cortex thalamus differentially relays input depending state arousal- gating involves inhibition thalamocortical relay neurons reticular nucleus thalamus- underlying mechanisms poorly understood reconstructed thalamocortical circuit artificial biological hybrid network vitro visual input simulated retinal cell activity show gain thalamic inhibitory feedback loop greater critical value circuit tends towards oscillations-and thus imposes temporal decorrelation retinal cell input thalamic relay output results functional disconnection cortex sensory drive feature typical sleep states conversely low gain feedback inhibition action noradrenaline known modulator arousal converge increase input-output correlation relay neurons combining gain control feedback inhibition modulation membrane excitability thus enables thalamic circuits finely tune gating spike transmission sensory organs cortex
