rapid formation selective stabilization synapses enduring motor memories 
novel motor skills learned repetitive practice acquired persist long training stops earlier studies shown learning induces increase efficacy synapses primary motor cortex persistence associated retention task- however motor learning affects neuronal circuitry level individual synapses long-lasting memory structurally encoded intact brain remain unknown show synaptic connections living mouse brain rapidly respond motor-skill learning permanently rewire training forelimb reaching task leads rapid within hour formation postsynaptic dendritic spines output pyramidal neurons contralateral motor cortex although selective elimination spines existed training gradually returns overall spine density back original level new spines induced learning preferentially stabilized subsequent training endure long training stops furthermore show different motor skills encoded different sets synapses practice novel previously learned tasks promotes dendritic spine formation adulthood findings reveal rapid long-lasting synaptic reorganization closely associated motor learning data also suggest stabilized neuronal connections foundation durable motor memory
