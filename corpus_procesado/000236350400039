controlled multiple reversals ratchet effect
single particle confined asymmetric potential demonstrates anticipated ratchet effect drifting along easy ratchet direction subjected non-equilibrium fluctuations- well-known effect can however dramatically changed potential captures several interacting particles demonstrate inter-particle interactions chain repelling particles captured ratchet potential can controllable way lead multiple drift reversals drift sign alternating positive negative number particles per ratchet period changes odd even demonstrate experimentally validity general prediction performed transport measurements c-driven vortices trapped superconductor array nanometre-scale asymmetric traps found direction vortex drift undergo multiple reversals vortex density increased excellent agreement model predictions drastic change drift behaviour single multiparticle systems can shed light different behaviour ratchets biomembranes two drift regimes: diluted single particles concentrated interacting particles
