spatiotemporal regulation myd88-irf signalling robust type-i interferon induction 
robust type-i interferon ifn-alpha/beta induction plasmacytoid dendritic cells activation toll-like receptor tlr9 constitutes critical aspect immunity- absolutely dependent transcription factor irf- interacts activated adaptor myd88 ref plasmacytoid dendritic cells cell types conventional dendritic cells able activate myd88 irf--dependent ifn induction pathway remains unknown show spatiotemporal regulation myd88 irf signalling critical high-level ifn induction response tlr9 activation ifn-inducing tlr9 ligand a/d-type cpg oligodeoxynucleotide cpg-a- retained long periods endosomal vesicles plasmacytoid dendritic cells together myd88-irf complex however conventional dendritic cells cpg-a rapidly transferred lysosomal vesicles show conventional dendritic cells can also mount robust ifn induction cpg-a manipulated endosomal retention using cationic lipid strategy also allows us demonstrate endosomal activation ifn pathway otherwise inactive tlr9 ligand b/k-type oligodeoxynucleotide cpg-b- thus study offers insights regulation tlr9 signalling space potentially suggesting new avenue therapeutic intervention
