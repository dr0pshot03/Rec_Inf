t cell receptor signaling precedes immunological synapse formation
area contact t cell antigen-presenting cell apc known immunological synapse although exact function unknown one model suggests allows t cell receptor tcr clustering sustained signaling t cells many hours demonstrate tcr-mediated tyrosine kinase signaling naive t cells occurred primarily periphery synapse largely abated mature immunological synapses formed data suggest many hours tcr signaling required t cell activation observations challenge current ideas role immunological synapses t cell activation
