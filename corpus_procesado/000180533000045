nicotinic acetylcholine receptor alpha subunit essential regulator inflammation
excessive inflammation tumour-necrosis factor tnf synthesis cause morbidity mortality diverse human diseases including endotoxaemia sepsis rheumatoid arthritis inflammatory bowel disease- highly conserved endogenous mechanisms normally regulate magnitude innate immune responses prevent excessive inflammation nervous system vagus nerve can inhibit significantly rapidly release macrophage tnf attenuate systemic inflammatory responses- physiological mechanism termed cholinergic anti inflammatory pathway major implications immunology therapeutics however identity essential macrophage acetylcholine-mediated cholinergic receptor responds vagus nerve signals previously unknown report nicotinic acetylcholine receptor alpha7 subunit required acetylcholine inhibition macrophage tnf release electrical stimulation vagus nerve inhibits tnf synthesis wild-type mice fails inhibit tnf synthesis alpha7-deficient mice thus nicotinic acetylcholine receptor alpha7 subunit essential inhibiting cytokine synthesis cholinergic anti inflammatory pathway
