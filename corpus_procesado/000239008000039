atomic-scale control friction actuation nanometer-sized contacts
stiction wear demanding problems nanoelectromechanical devices large surface-to-volume ratios inapplicability traditional liquid lubricants efficient way switch friction atomic scale achieved exciting mechanical resonances sliding system perpendicular contact plane resulting variations interaction energy reduce friction piconewtons finite range excitation load without noticeable wear without actuation atomic stick-slip motion leads dissipation observed range even normal oscillations require energy actuate technique represents valuable way minimize energy dissipation nanocontacts
