chemical speciation drives hydrothermal vent ecology
physiology biochemistry many taxa inhabiting deep-sea hydrothermal vents elucidated- however physicochemical factors controlling distribution organisms given vent site remain enigma years research- chemical speciation particular elements suggested key controlling biological community structure extreme aquatic environments implementation electrochemical technology allowed us make situ measurements chemical speciation vents located east pacific rise degrees n scale relevant biology report significant differences oxygen iron sulphur speciation strongly correlate distribution specific taxa different microhabitats higher temperature > degreesc microhabitats appreciable formation soluble iron-sulphide molecular clusters markedly reduces availability free h2s/ hs vent microorganisms thus controlling available habitat
