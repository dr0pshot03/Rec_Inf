structural identification bacterial quorum-sensing signal containing boron 
cell-cell communication bacteria accomplished exchange extracellular signalling molecules called autoinducers process termed quorum sensing allows bacterial populations coordinate gene expression community cooperation probably enhances effectiveness processes bioluminescence virulence factor expression antibiotic production biofilm development- unlike autoinducers specific particular species bacteria recently discovered autoinducer ai- produced large number bacterial species ai proposed serve universal signal inter-species communication chemical identity ai however proved elusive present crystal structure ai sensor protein luxp complex autoinducer bound ligand furanosyl borate diester bears resemblance previously characterized autoinducers findings suggest addition naturally occurring borate ai precursor generates active ai- furthermore indicate potential biological role boron element required number organisms unknown reasons
