serial deletions duplications suggest mechanism collinearity hoxd genes limbs
hox genes located one end hoxd cluster essential development extremities limbs digits collinear correspondence accompanied gradual decrease transcriptional efficiency genes decipher underlying regulatory mechanisms thus understand better digits develop engineered series deletions duplications vivo find hoxd genes compete remote enhancer recognizes locus polar fashion preference extremity modifications either number topography hoxd loci induced regulatory reallocations affecting number morphology digits results demonstrate genes located extremity cluster expressed distal end limbs following gradual reduction transcriptional efficiency thus highlight mechanistic nature collinearity limbs
