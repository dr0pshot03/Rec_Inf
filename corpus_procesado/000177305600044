isolation human gene inhibits hiv infection suppressed viral vif protein 
viruses developed diverse non-immune strategies counteract host-mediated mechanisms confer resistance infection vif virion infectivity factor proteins encoded primate immunodeficiency viruses notably human immunodeficiency virus hiv- proteins potent regulators virus infection replication consequently essential pathogenic infections vivo- hiv vif seems required late stages virus production suppression innate antiviral phenotype resides human t lymphocytes thus absence vif expression phenotype renders progeny virions non-infectious describe unique cellular gene cem15 whose transient stable expression cells normally express cem15 recreates phenotype whose antiviral action overcome presence vif vif: cem15 regulatory circuit critical hiv replication perturbing circuit may promising target future hiv/aids therapies
