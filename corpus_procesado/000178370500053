evolution supergene families associated insecticide resistance
emergence insecticide resistance mosquito poses serious threat efficacy many malaria control programs searched anopheles gambiae genome members three major enzyme families-the carboxylesterases glutathione transferases cytochrome p450s-that primarily responsible metabolic resistance insecticides comparative genomic analysis drosophila melanogaster reveals considerable expansion supergene families occurred mosquito low gene orthology little chromosomal synteny paradoxically contrast easily identified orthologous groups genes presumably seeded common ancestors gambiae independent expansion paralogous genes mainly consequence formation clusters among locally duplicated genes expansions may reflect functional diversification supergene families consistent major differences life history ecology organisms data provide basis identifying resistance-associated enzymes within families will enable resistance status mosquitoes flies possibly holometabolous insects monitored analyses also provide means identifying previously unknown molecules involved fundamental biological processes development
