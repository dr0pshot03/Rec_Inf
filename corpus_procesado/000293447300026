non-co2 greenhouse gases climate change
earths climate warming result anthropogenic emissions greenhouse gases particularly carbon dioxide co2 fossil fuel combustion anthropogenic emissions non-co2 greenhouse gases methane nitrous oxide ozone-depleting substances largely sources fossil fuels also contribute significantly warming non-co2 greenhouse gases much shorter lifetimes co2 reducing emissions offers additional opportunity lessen future climate change although clear sustainably reducing warming influence greenhouse gases will possible substantial cuts emissions co2 reducing non-co2 greenhouse gas emissions relatively quick way contributing goal
