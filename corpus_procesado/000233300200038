potential impacts warming climate water availability snow-dominated regions
currently available climate models predict near-surface warming trend influence rising levels greenhouse gases atmosphere addition direct effects climate-for example frequency heatwaves-this increase surface temperatures important consequences hydrological cycle particularly regions water supply currently dominated melting snow ice warmer world less winter precipitation falls snow melting winter snow occurs earlier spring even without changes precipitation intensity effects lead shift peak river runoff winter early spring away summer autumn demand highest storage capacities sufficient much winter runoff will immediately lost oceans one-sixth earths population relying glaciers seasonal snow packs water supply consequences hydrological changes future water availability-predicted high confidence already diagnosed regions-are likely severe
