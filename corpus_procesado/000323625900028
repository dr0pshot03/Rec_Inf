rigid weathered ice shell titan 
several lines evidence suggest saturns largest moon titan global subsurface ocean beneath outer ice shell kilometres thick- convection occurring rigid portion shell expected thin similarly weak isostatically compensated shell proposed explain observed topography report strong inverse correlation gravity topography long wavelengths dominated tides rotation argue negative gravity anomalies mass deficits produced crustal thickening base ice shell overwhelm positive gravity anomalies mass excesses produced small surface topography giving rise inverse correlation show situation requires substantially rigid ice shell elastic thickness exceeding kilometres hundreds metres surface erosion deposition consistent recent estimates local features results therefore compatible geologically active low-rigidity ice shell extrapolating wavelengths controlled tides rotation suggest titans moment inertia may even higher titan may even less centrally condensed currently thought
