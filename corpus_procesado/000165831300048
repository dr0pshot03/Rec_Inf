fluorescent pigments corals photoprotective
reef-forming corals depend photosynthesis performed algal symbiont corals therefore restricted photic zone intensity light zone declines several orders magnitude-from high damaging levels surface extreme shade conditions lower limit ability corals tolerate range implies effective mechanisms light acclimation adaptation show fluorescent pigments- fps corals provide photobiological system regulating light environment coral host tissue previous studies suggested low light fps may enhance light availability now report excessive sunlight fps photoprotective achieve dissipating excess energy wavelengths low photosynthetic activity well reflecting visible infrared light fp-containing chromatophores also show fps enhance resistance mass bleaching corals periods heat stress implications effect environmental stress diversity reef-building corals enhanced survival broad range corals allowing maintenance habitat diversity
