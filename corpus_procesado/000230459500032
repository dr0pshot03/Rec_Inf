mammalian mutagenesis using highly mobile somatic sleeping beauty transposon system 
transposons provided important genetic tools functional genomic screens lower eukaryotes proven less useful higher eukaryotes low transposition frequency show sleeping beauty sb member tc1/mariner class transposons can mobilized mouse somatic cells frequencies high enough induce embryonic death cancer wild-type mice tumours aggressive animals developing two even three different types cancer within months birth tumours result sb insertional mutagenesis cancer genes thus facilitating identification genes pathways induce disease sb transposition can easily controlled mutagenize target tissue can therefore principle used induce many cancers affecting humans including little known aetiology uses sb also restricted mouse potentially used forward genetic screens higher eukaryote transgenesis possible
