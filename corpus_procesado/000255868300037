stress fold localization thin elastic membranes
thin elastic membranes supported much softer elastic solid fluid deviate flat geometries upon compression demonstrate periodic wrinkling one possible solution strained membranes folds involve highly localized curvature appear whenever membrane compressed beyond third initial wrinkle wavelength eventually surface transforms symmetry-broken state flat regions membrane coexisting locally folded points reminiscent crumpled unsupported membrane provide general scaling laws wrinkled folded states proved transition numerical experimental supported membranes work provides insight interfacial stability diverse systems biological membranes lung surfactant nanoparticle thin films
