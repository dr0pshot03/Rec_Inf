global analysis short rnas reveals widespread promoter-proximal stalling arrest pol ii drosophila
emerging evidence indicates gene expression higher organisms regulated rna polymerase ii stalling early transcription elongation probe mechanisms responsible regulation developed methods isolate characterize short rnas derived stalled rna polymerase ii drosophila cells significant levels short rnas generated one-third genes indicating promoter-proximal stalling general feature early polymerase elongation nucleotide composition initially transcribed sequence played important role promoting transcriptional stalling rendering polymerase elongation complexes highly susceptible backtracking arrest results indicate intrinsic efficiency early elongation can greatly affect gene expression
