bright coherent ultrahigh harmonics kev x-ray regime mid-infrared femtosecond lasers 
high-harmonic generation hhg traditionally combines similar near-infrared laser photons generate bright phase-matched extreme ultraviolet beams emission many atoms adds constructively show guiding mid-infrared femtosecond laser high-pressure gas ultrahigh harmonics can generated orders greater emerge bright supercontinuum spans entire electromagnetic spectrum ultraviolet kilo-electron volts allowing principle generation pulses short attoseconds multiatmosphere gas pressures required bright phase-matched emission also support laser beam self-confinement enhancing x-ray yield finally x-ray beam exhibits high spatial coherence even though high gas density recolliding electrons responsible hhg encounter atoms emission process
