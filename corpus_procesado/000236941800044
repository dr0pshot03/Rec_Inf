atomic pillar-based nanoprecipitates strengthen almgsi alloys
atomic-resolution electron microscopy reveals pillarlike silicon double columns exist hardening nanoprecipitates almgsi alloys vary structure composition upon annealing si pillars provide skeleton nanoparticles evolve composition structure morphology show begin tiny nuclei composition close mg2si2al7 minimal mismatch aluminum matrix subsequently undergo one-dimensional growth association compositional change becoming elongated particles evolution toward final mg5si6 particles compositional change accompanied characteristic structural change study explains nanoscopic reasons alloys make excellent automotive materials
