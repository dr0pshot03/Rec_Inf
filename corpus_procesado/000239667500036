neurospora checkpoint kinase : regulatory link circadian cell cycles 
clock gene period prd- neurospora identified single allele displaying shortened circadian period altered temperature compensation positional cloning followed functional tests show prd ortholog mammalian checkpoint kinase chk2 expression prd regulated circadian clock reciprocally prd physically interacts clock component frq promoting phosphorylation dna-damaging agents can reset clock manner depends time day resetting dependent prd- thus prd- neurospora chk2 identifies molecular link feeds back conditionally circadian output input cell cycle
