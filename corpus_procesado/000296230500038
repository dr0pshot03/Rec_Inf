clonal production organization inhibitory interneurons neocortex 
neocortex contains excitatory neurons inhibitory interneurons clones neocortical excitatory neurons originating progenitor cell spatially organized contribute formation functional microcircuits contrast relatively little known production organization neocortical inhibitory interneurons found neocortical inhibitory interneurons produced spatially organized clonal units developing ventral telencephalon furthermore clonally related interneurons randomly disperse formed spatially isolated clusters neocortex individual clonal clusters consisting interneurons expressing distinct neurochemical markers exhibited clear vertical horizontal organization results suggest lineage relationship plays pivotal role organization inhibitory interneurons neocortex
