ectodomain toll-like receptor cleaved generate functional receptor 
mammalian toll-like receptors tlrs initiate immune responses infection recognizing microbial nucleic acids12; however responses come cost potential autoimmunity owing inappropriate recognition self nucleic acids3 localization tlr9 tlr7 intracellular compartments seems role facilitating responses viral nucleic acids maintaining tolerance self nucleic acids yet cell biology regulating transport localization receptors remains poorly understood4- define route tlr9 tlr7 exit endoplasmic reticulum travel endolysosomes mouse macrophages dendritic cells ectodomains tlr9 tlr7 cleaved endolysosome full length protein detectable compartment ligand recognized notably although full length cleaved forms tlr9 capable binding ligand processed form recruits myd88 activation indicating truncated receptor rather full length form functional furthermore conditions prevent receptor proteolysis including forced tlr9 surface localization render receptor non functional propose ectodomain cleavage represents strategy restrict receptor activation endolysosomal compartments prevent tlrs responding self nucleic acids
