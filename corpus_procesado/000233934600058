hypomethylation-linked activation pax2 mediates tamoxifen-stimulated endometrial carcinogenesis
tamoxifen selective oestrogen receptor modulator used treatment stages hormone-responsive breast cancer however tamoxifen shows partial oestrogenic activity uterus use associated increased incidence endometrial cancer molecular explanation observations known show tamoxifen oestrogen distinct overlapping target gene profiles among overlapping target genes identify paired-box gene pax2 crucially involved cell proliferation carcinogenesis endometrium experiments show pax2 activated oestrogen tamoxifen endometrial carcinomas normal endometrium activation associated cancer-linked hypomethylation pax2 promoter
