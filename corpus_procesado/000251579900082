infinite-layer iron oxide square-planar coordination 
conventional high temperature reactions limit control coordination polyhedra transition metal oxides obtainable within bounds known coordination geometries given transition metal example iron atoms almost exclusively coordinated three dimensional polyhedra tetrahedra octahedra however recent works shown binary metal hydrides act reducing agents low temperatures allowing access unprecedented structures- show reaction perovskite srfeo3 cah2 yield srfeo2 new compound bearing square planar oxygen coordination around fe2+ srfeo2 isostructural infinite layer cupric oxides- exhibits magnetic order far room temperature spite two-dimensional structure indicating strong in-layer magnetic interactions due strong fe d o p hybridization surprisingly srfeo2 remains free structural instability might well expected low temperatures owing twofold orbital degeneracy fe2+ ground state d-4h point symmetry reduction oxidation srfeo2 srfeo3 proceed via brownmillerite type intermediate srfeo2 start relatively low temperature similar k making material appealing variety applications including oxygen ion conduction oxygen gas absorption catalysis
