c-elegans odour discrimination requires asymmetric diversity olfactory neurons
caenorhabditis elegans senses least five attractive odours single pair olfactory neurons awc can distinguish among odours behavioural assays two awc neurons structurally functionally similar g-protein-coupled receptor str randomly expressed either left right awc neuron never describe isolation mutant ky542 specific defects odour discrimination odour chemotaxis ky542 allele nsy- neuronal symmetry nsy mutant str expressed awc neurons nsy mutants exhibit discrimination olfactory defects like nsy mutants laser ablation awc neuron express str awcoff recapitulates behavioural phenotype nsy mutants whereas laser ablation str--expressing awc neuron awcon causes different chemotaxis defects propose odour discrimination can achieved segregating detection different odours distinct olfactory neurons unique combinations olfactory neurons
