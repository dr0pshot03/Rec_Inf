highly ordered arrangement single neurons orientation pinwheels
visual cortex higher mammals neurons arranged across cortical surface orderly map preferred stimulus orientations map contains orientation pinwheels structures arranged like spokes wheel orientation changes continuously around centre conventional optical imaging first demonstrated pinwheels technique lacked spatial resolution determine response properties arrangement cells near pinwheel centres electrophysiological recordings later demonstrated sharply selective neurons near pinwheel centres remained unclear whether arranged randomly orderly fashion use two-photon calcium imaging vivo- determine microstructure pinwheel centres cat visual cortex single-cell resolution find pinwheel centres highly ordered: neurons selective different orientations clearly segregated even centre thus pinwheel centres truly represent singularities cortical map highly ordered arrangement level single cells suggests great precision development cortical circuits underlying orientation selectivity
