pollen factor linking inter intraspecific pollen rejection tomato
self-incompatibility si-intraspecific pollen recognition systems allow plants avoid inbreeding-in solanaceae nightshade family controlled polymorphic s locus self pollen rejected pistils matching s alleles contrast unilateral interspecific incompatibility ui prevents hybridization related species commonly pollen donor self-compatible sc recipient si observed solanum pollen-expressed cullin1 gene high similarity petunia si factors interacts genetically gene near s locus control ui cultivated tomato related red-or orange-fruited species sc exhibit loss-of-function mutation gene whereas green-fruited species mostly si contain functional allele hence similar biochemical mechanisms underlie rejection self interspecific pollen
