directional switching kinesin cin8 motor coupling 
kinesin motor proteins thought move exclusively either one direction along microtubules proteins kinesin- family tetrameric microtubule cross-linking motors important cell division differentiation various organisms kinesin- motors considered plus-end-directed however found purified kinesin- cin8 budding yeast behave bidirectional kinesin individual microtubules single cin8 motors minus-end-directed motors whereas switched plus-end-directed motility working team motors sliding antiparallel microtubules apart kinesin can thus change directionality movement depending whether acts alone ensemble
