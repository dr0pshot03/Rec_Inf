scale invariance universality force networks static granular matter
force networks form skeleton static granular matter key factor determines mechanical properties stability elasticity sound transmission important civil engineering industrial processing previous studies focused investigations global structure external forces- boundary condition probability distribution individual contact forces far however precise knowledge disordered spatial structure force network remained elusive report molecular dynamics simulations realistic granular packings reveal scale invariance clusters particles interacting means relatively strong forces despite visual variation force networks various values confining pressure parameters identical scaling exponents scaling function thereby determining universality class unexpectedly flat ensemble force configurations- simple generalization equilibrium statistical mechanics belongs universality class whereas widely studied simplified models- implies elasticity grains geometrical disorder affect universal mechanical properties
