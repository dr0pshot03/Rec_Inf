mechanochemical analysis dna gyrase using rotor bead tracking 
dna gyrase molecular machine uses energy atp hydrolysis introduce essential negative supercoils dna- directionality supercoiling ensured chiral wrapping dna around specialized domain- enzyme strand passage observe activity gyrase real time tracking rotation submicrometre bead attached side stretched dna molecule presence gyrase atp observe bursts rotation corresponding processive stepwise introduction negative supercoils strict multiples two changes dna tension detectable effect supercoiling velocity enzyme becomes markedly less processive tension increased range tenths piconewtons behaviour quantitatively explained simple mechanochemical model processivity depends kinetic competition dissociation rapid tension-sensitive dna wrapping high-resolution variant assay directly detect rotational pauses corresponding two kinetic substeps: atp-independent step end reaction cycle atp-binding step middle cycle subsequent dna wrapping
