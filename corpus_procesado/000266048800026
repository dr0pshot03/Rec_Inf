tail integrins talin kindlins 
integrins transmembrane cell-adhesion molecules carry signals outside inside cell vice versa like cell surface receptors integrins signal response ligand binding; however events within cell can also regulate affinity integrins ligands feature important physiological situations blood cells always close proximity ligands yet cell-ligand interactions occur integrin activation response specific external cues review focuses mechanisms whereby two key proteins talin kindlins regulate integrin activation binding tails integrin-beta subunits
