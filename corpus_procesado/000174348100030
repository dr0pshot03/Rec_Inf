electrical discharge thundercloud top lower ionosphere
century numerous undocumented reports appeared unusual large-scale luminous phenomena thunderclouds- years ago suggested electrical discharge bridge gap thundercloud upper atmosphere since two classes vertically extensive optical flashes thunderclouds identified-sprites- blue jets- sprites initiate near base ionosphere develop rapidly downwards speeds can exceed m s- ref assume many different geometrical forms- contrast blue jets develop upwards cloud tops speeds order m s- characterized blue conical shape- experimental data related sprites blue jets reported conclusively indicate establish direct path electrical contact thundercloud lower ionosphere report video recording blue jet propagating upwards thundercloud altitude km taken arecibo observatory puerto rico altitude km normally upper limit blue jets lower terminal altitude sprites-the flash exhibited features normally observed sprites observed phenomenon relatively small thunderstorm cell speculate may common therefore represent unaccounted component global electric circuit
