driving fast-spiking cells induces gamma rhythm controls sensory responses 
cortical gamma oscillations hz predict increases focused attention failure gamma regulation hallmark neurological psychiatric disease current theory predicts gamma oscillations generated synchronous activity fast-spiking inhibitory interneurons resulting rhythmic inhibition producing neural ensemble synchrony generating narrow window effective excitation causally tested hypotheses barrel cortex vivo targeting optogenetic manipulation selectively fast-spiking interneurons show light-driven activation fast-spiking interneurons varied frequencies hz selectively amplifies gamma oscillations contrast pyramidal neuron activation amplifies lower frequency oscillations cell-type-specific double dissociation found timing sensory input relative gamma cycle determined amplitude precision evoked responses data directly support fast-spiking-gamma hypothesis provide first causal evidence distinct network activity states can induced vivo cell-type-specific activation
