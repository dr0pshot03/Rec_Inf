radical site chlamydial ribonucleotide reductase defines new r2 subclass
ribonucleotide reductase rnr synthesizes deoxyribonucleotides dna synthesis r2 protein normal class ribonucleotide reductases contains diiron site produces stable tyrosyl free radical essential enzymatic activity structural electron paramagnetic resonance studies r2 chlamydia trachomatis reveal protein lacking tyrosyl radical site instead protein yields iron-coupled radical upon reconstitution coordinating structure diiron site similar diiron oxidases/monoxygenases supports role radical rnr mechanism specific ligand pattern c trachomatis r2 metal site characterizes new group r2 proteins far found eight organisms three human pathogens
