detection branched alkyl molecule interstellar medium: iso-propyl cyanide
largest noncyclic molecules detected interstellar medium ism organic straight-chain carbon backbone report interstellar detection branched alkyl molecule iso-propyl cyanide i-c3h7cn abundance times straight-chain structural isomer detection suggests branched carbon-chain molecules may generally abundant ism astrochemical model indicates isomers produced within upon dust grain ice mantles addition molecular radicals albeit via differing reaction pathways production iso-propyl cyanide appears require addition functional group nonterminal carbon chain detection therefore bodes well presence ism amino acids side-chain structure key characteristic
