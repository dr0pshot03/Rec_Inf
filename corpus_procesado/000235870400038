synthesis characterization nitrides platinum iridium
transition metal nitrides great technological fundamental importance strength durability useful optical electronic magnetic properties evaluated recently synthesized platinum nitride ptn shown large bulk modulus propose structure isostructural pyrite stoichiometry ptn2 also synthesized recoverable nitride iridium nearly conditions pressure temperature ptn2 although stoichiometry exhibits much lower structural symmetry preliminary results suggest bulk modulus material also large
