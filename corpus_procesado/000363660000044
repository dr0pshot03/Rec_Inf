quantum griffiths singularity superconductor-metal transition ga thin films 
griffiths singularity phase transition caused disorder effects predicted years ago signature divergence dynamical critical exponent challenging observe experimentally report experimental observation quantum griffiths singularity two-dimensional superconducting system measured transport properties atomically thin gallium films found films undergo superconductor-metal transitions increasing magnetic field approaching zero-temperature quantum critical point observed divergence dynamical critical exponent consistent griffiths singularity behavior interpret observed superconductor-metal quantum phase transition infinite-randomness critical point properties system controlled rare large superconducting regions
