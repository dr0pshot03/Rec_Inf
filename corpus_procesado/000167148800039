prediction absolute crystal-nucleation rate hard-sphere colloids
crystal nucleation much-studied phenomenon yet rate occurs remains difficult predict small crystal nuclei form spontaneously supersaturated solutions unless size exceeds critical value-the so-called critical nucleus-they will re-dissolve rather grow rate-limiting step proved difficult probe experimentally crystal nucleation rate depends p-crit small probability critical nucleus forms spontaneously kinetic factor kappa measures rate critical nuclei subsequently grow given absence priori knowledge either quantity classical nucleation theory commonly used analyse crystal nucleation experiments unconstrained parameters adjusted fit observations approach yields first principles prediction absolute nucleation rates approach problem different angle simulating nucleation process suspension hard colloidal spheres obtain quantitative numerical predictions crystal nucleation rate find large discrepancies computed nucleation rates deduced experiments-: best experimental estimates p-crit seem large several orders magnitude
