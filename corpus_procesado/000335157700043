greater sensitivity drought accompanies maize yield increase us midwest 
key question climate change adaptation whether existing cropping systems can become less sensitive climate variations use field-level data set maize soybean yields central united states examine changes drought sensitivity although yields increased absolute value levels stress crops sensitivity maize yields drought stress associated high vapor pressure deficits increased greater sensitivity occurred despite cultivar improvements increased carbon dioxide reflects agronomic trend toward higher sowing densities results suggest agronomic changes tend translate improved drought tolerance plants higher average yields decreasing drought sensitivity yields field scale
