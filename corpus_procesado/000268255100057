er-mitochondria tethering complex revealed synthetic biology screen
communication organelles important feature eukaryotic cells uncover components involved mitochondria/endoplasmic reticulum er junctions screened mutants complemented synthetic protein designed artificially tether two organelles identified mmm1/mdm10/mdm12/mdm34 complex molecular tether er mitochondria tethering complex composed proteins resident er mitochondria use genome-wide mapping genetic interactions showed components tethering complex functionally connected phospholipid biosynthesis calcium-signaling genes mutant cells phospholipid biosynthesis impaired tethering complex localized discrete foci suggesting discrete sites close apposition er mitochondria facilitate interorganelle calcium phospholipid exchange
