spontaneously emerging cortical representations visual attributes
spontaneous cortical activity ongoing activity absence intentional sensory input studied extensively using methods ranging eeg electroencephalography- voltage sensitive dye imaging- recordings single neurons ongoing cortical activity shown play critical role development- must also essential processing sensory perception modulates stimulus-evoked activity correlated behaviour yet role processing external information relationship internal representations sensory attributes remains unknown using voltage sensitive dye imaging previously established close link ongoing activity visual cortex anaesthetized cats spontaneous firing single neuron report activity encompasses set dynamically switching cortical states many correspond closely orientation maps orientation state emerged spontaneously spanned several hypercolumns often followed state corresponding proximal orientation suggest dynamically switching cortical states represent brains internal context therefore reflect influence memory perception behaviour
