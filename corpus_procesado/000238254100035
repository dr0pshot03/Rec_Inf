single-cell proteomic analysis s-cerevisiae reveals architecture biological noise
major goal biology provide quantitative description cellular behaviour task however hampered difficulty measuring protein abundances variation present strategy pairs high-throughput flow cytometry library gfp-tagged yeast strains monitor rapidly precisely protein levels single-cell resolution bulk protein abundance measurements > proteins rich minimal media provide detailed view cellular response conditions capture many changes observed dna microarray analyses single-cell data argue noise protein expression dominated stochastic production/destruction messenger rnas beyond global trend dramatic protein-specific differences noise strongly correlated proteins mode transcription function example proteins respond environmental changes noisy whereas involved protein synthesis quiet thus studies reveal remarkable structure biological noise suggest protein noise levels selected reflect costs potential benefits variation
