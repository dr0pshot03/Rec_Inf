initiation subduction: criticality addition water 
subduction major process plate tectonics however initiation understood used high-resolution less kilometer finite-element models based rheological data lithosphere investigate role played water initiating subduction solid-fluid thermomechanical instability needed drive cold stiff negatively buoyant lithosphere mantle instability can triggered slowly sedimentary loading time span million years results indicate subduction can proceed double feedback mechanism thermoelastic thermal-rheological promoted lubrication due water
