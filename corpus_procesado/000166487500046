crystal structure initiation factor bound 30s ribosomal subunit
initiation translation correct position messenger rna essential accurate protein synthesis prokaryotes process requires three initiation factors: if1 if2 if3 report crystal structure complex if1 30s ribosomal subunit binding if1 occludes ribosomal site flips functionally important bases a1492 a1493 helix 16s rna burying pockets if1 binding if1 causes long-range changes conformation h44 leads movement domains 30s respect structure explains localized changes ribosomal site lead global alterations conformation 30s subunit
