polo kinase controls cell-cycle-dependent transcription targeting coactivator protein
polo kinases crucial conserved functions controlling eukaryotic cell cycle orchestrating several events mitosis essential element cell cycle control exerted altering expression key regulators show important function polo kinase cdc5p controlling cell-cycle-dependent gene expression crucial execution mitosis model eukaryote saccharomyces cerevisiae particular find cdc5p temporally recruited promoters cell-cycle-regulated clb2 gene cluster targets mcm1p-fkh2p-ndd1p transcription factor complex direct phosphorylation coactivator protein ndd1p phosphorylation event required normal temporal expression cell-cycle-regulated genes clb2 swi5 g2/m phases furthermore severe defects cell division occur absence cdc5p-mediated phosphorylation ndd1p thus polo kinase required production key mitotic regulators addition previously defined roles controlling mitotic events
