exome sequencing identifies rare ldlr apoa5 alleles conferring risk myocardial infarction
myocardial infarction mi leading cause death around world displays complex pattern inheritance mi occurs early life genetic inheritance major component risk previously rare mutations low-density lipoprotein ldl genes shown contribute mi risk inindividual families- whereas common variants loci associated mi risk population- evaluate rare mutations contribute early-onset mi risk population sequenced protein-coding regions genomes patients mi early age < years inmales < years females along mi-free controls identified two genes rare coding-sequence mutations frequent mi cases versus controls exome-wide significance low-density lipoprotein receptor ldlr carriers rare non-synonymous mutations -fold increased risk mi carriers null alleles ldlr even higher risk -fold difference approximately % early mi cases harbour rare damaging mutation ldlr estimate similar one made years ago using analysis total cholesterol among controls carried ldlr coding-sequence mutation plasma ldl cholesterol > mg dl- apolipoprotein a-v apoa5 carriers rare non-synonymous mutations -fold increased risk mi compared non-carriers ldlr mutation carriers higher plasma ldl cholesterol whereas apoa5 mutation carriers higher plasma triglycerides recent evidence connected mi risk coding-sequence mutations two genes functionally related apoa5 namely lipoprotein lipase apolipoprotein c-iii refs combined observations suggest well ldl cholesterol disordered metabolism triglyceride-rich lipoproteins contributes mi risk
