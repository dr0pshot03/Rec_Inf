stability magnesite high-pressure form lowermost mantle 
carbonates important constituents marine sediments play fundamental role recycling carbon earths deep interior via subduction oceanic crust sediments- study stability carbonates high pressure temperature thus important modelling carbon budget entire earth system studies however rarely performed appropriate lower-mantle conditions experimental data exist pressures greater gpa refs report situ x-ray diffraction study stability magnesite mgco3 major component subducted carbonates pressure temperature conditions approaching core-mantle boundary found magnesite transforms unknown form pressures similar to115 gpa temperatures - k depths similar to2 km without dissociation suggesting magnesite high-pressure form may major hosts carbon throughout parts earths lower mantle
