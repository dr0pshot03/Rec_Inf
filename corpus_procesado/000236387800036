cenozoic plant diversity neotropics
several mechanisms proposed explain high levels plant diversity neotropics today little known diversification patterns neotropical floras geological time present longest time series compiled palynological plant diversity neotropics stratigraphic sections samples morphospecies occurrences paleocene early miocene million years ago central colombia western venezuela record shows low-diversity paleocene flora significantly diverse early middle eocene flora exceeding holocene levels decline diversity end eocene early oligocene good correlation diversity fluctuations changes global temperature found suggesting tropical climate change may directly driving observed diversity pattern alternatively good correspondence may result control climate exerts area available tropical plants grow
