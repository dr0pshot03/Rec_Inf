toll-like receptor recognizes bacterial dna 
dna bacteria stimulatory effects mammalian immune cells- depend presence unmethylated cpg dinucleotides bacterial dna contrast mammalian dna low frequency cpg dinucleotides mostly methylated therefore mammalian dna immune-stimulatory activity cpg dna induces strong t-helper--like inflammatory response- accumulating evidence revealed therapeutic potential cpg dna adjuvants vaccination strategies cancer allergy infectious diseasess- despite promising clinical use molecular mechanism cpg dna activates immune cells remains unclear show cellular response cpg dna mediated toll-like receptor tlr9 tlr9-deficient tlr9-/- mice show response cpg dna including proliferation splenocytes inflammatory cytokine production macrophages maturation dendritic cells tlr9-/- mice showed resistance lethal effect cpg dna without elevation serum pro-inflammatory cytokine levels vivo cpg-dna-mediated t-helper type response also abolished tlr9-/- mice thus vertebrate immune systems appear evolved specific toll-like receptor distinguishes bacterial dna self-dna
