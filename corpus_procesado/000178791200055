heterogeneous atmospheric aerosol production acid-catalyzed particle-phase reactions 
according evidence laboratory acidic surfaces atmospheric aerosols lead potentially multifold increases secondary organic aerosol soa mass experimental observations using multichannel flow reactor teflon polytetrauoroethylene film bag batch reactors outdoor teflon-film smog chambers strongly confirm inorganic acids sulfuric acid catalyze particle-phase heterogeneous reactions atmospheric organic carbonyl species net result large increase soa mass stabilized organic layers particles age acid-catalyzed heterogeneous reactions soa products included current models predicted soa formation will much greater much larger impact climate forcing effects now predict
