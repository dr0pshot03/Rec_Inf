thylakoid-located two-pore k+ channel controls photosynthetic light utilization plants 
size light-induced proton motive force pmf across thylakoid membrane chloroplasts regulated response environmental stimuli describe component thylakoid membrane two-pore potassium k+ channel tpk3 modulates composition pmf ion counterbalancing recombinant tpk3 exhibited potassium-selective channel activity sensitive ca2+ h+ arabidopsis plants channel found thylakoid stromal lamellae arabidopsis plants silenced tpk3 gene display reduced growth altered thylakoid membrane organization phenotype reflects impaired capacity generate normal pmf results reduced co2 assimilation deficient nonphotochemical dissipation excess absorbed light thus tpk3 channel manages pmf necessary convert photochemical energy physiological functions
