necessity afferent activity maintain eye-specific segregation ferret lateral geniculate nucleus 
adult mammal retinal ganglion cell axon arbors restricted eye-specific layers lateral geniculate nucleus blocking neuronal activity early development prevents segregation occurring test whether activity also required maintain eye-specific segregation ganglion cell activity blocked segregation established caused desegregation eyes axons became concentrated lumina normally occupied contralateral afferents results show activity-dependent process necessary maintaining eye-specific segregation suggest activity-independent cues may favor lamina target arborization afferents eyes
