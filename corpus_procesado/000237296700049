sv2 protein receptor botulinum neurotoxin 
widely used botulinum neurotoxin bont/a recognizes enters neurons poorly understood found bont/a enters neurons binding synaptic vesicle protein sv2 isoforms b c fragments sv2 harbor toxin interaction domain inhibited bont/a binding neurons bont/a binding sv2a sv2b knockout hippocampal neurons abolished restored expressing sv2a sv2b sv2c reduction sv2 expression pc12 neuro-2a cells also inhibited entry bont/a restored expressing sv2 isoforms finally mice lacked sv2 isoform sv2b displayed reduced sensitivity bont/a thus sv2 acts protein receptor bont/a
