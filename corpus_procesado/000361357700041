fractal atomic-level percolation metallic glasses
metallic glasses metallic alloys exhibit exotic material properties may fractal structures atomic level physical mechanism organization without ordering identified demonstrated crossover fractal short-range < atomic diameters homogeneous long-range structures using situ x-ray diffraction tomography molecular dynamics simulations specific class fractal percolation cluster explains structural details several metallic-glass compositions postulate atoms percolate liquid phase percolating cluster becomes rigid glass transition temperature
