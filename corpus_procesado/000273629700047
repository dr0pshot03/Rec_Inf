functional evolutionary insights genomes three parasitoid nasonia species 
report genome sequences comparative analyses three closely related parasitoid wasps: nasonia vitripennis n giraulti n longicornis parasitoids important regulators arthropod populations including major agricultural pests disease vectors nasonia emerging genetic model particularly evolutionary developmental genetics key findings include identification functional dna methylation tool kit; hymenopteran-specific genes including diverse venoms; lateral gene transfers among pox viruses wolbachia nasonia; rapid evolution genes involved nuclear-mitochondrial interactions implicated speciation newly developed genome resources advance nasonia genetic research accelerate mapping cloning quantitative trait loci will ultimately provide tools knowledge increasing utility parasitoids pest insect-control agents
