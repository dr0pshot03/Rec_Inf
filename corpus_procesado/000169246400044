anisotropy thermal diffusivity upper mantle
heat transfer mantle key process controlling earths dynamics upper-mantle mineral phases especially olivine shown display highly anisotropic thermal diffusivity ambient conditions seismic anisotropy data show preferred orientations olivine induced deformation coherent large scales > km upper mantle thus heat transport upper mantle anisotropic thermal anisotropy mantle minerals high temperature relationship deformation well constrained present petrophysical modelling laboratory measurements thermal diffusivity deformed mantle rocks temperatures k demonstrate deformation may induce significant anisotropy thermal diffusivity uppermost mantle found heat transport parallel flow direction per cent faster normal flow plane strain-induced thermal anisotropy implies upper-mantle temperature distribution rheology consequently dynamics will depend deformation history oceans resistive drag flow result lower vertical diffusivities lithosphere asthenosphere hence less effective heat transfer convective mantle continents olivine orientations frozen lithosphere may induce anisotropic heating mantle plumes favouring reactivation pre-existing structures
