regulation gene expression metabolic enzyme
gene expression eukaryotes normally believed controlled transcriptional regulators activate genes encoding structural proteins enzymes identify previously unrecognized dna binding activities yeast proteome microarray screened dna probes arg5 well-characterized mitochondrial enzyme involved arginine biosynthesis identified chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments revealed arg5 associated specific nuclear mitochondrial loci vivo arg5 binds specific fragments vitro deletion arg5 causes altered transcript levels nuclear mitochondrial target genes results indicate metabolic enzymes can directly regulate eukaryotic gene expression
