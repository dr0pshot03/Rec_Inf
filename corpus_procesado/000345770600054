structures bacterial homologues sweet transporters two distinct conformations 
sweets prokaryotic homologues monosaccharide disaccharide transporters present archaea plants humans- sweets play crucial roles cellular sugar efflux processes: phloem loading pollen nutrition nectar secretion bacterial homologues called semisweets among smallest known transporters show semisweet molecules consist triple-helix bundle form symmetrical parallel dimers thereby generating translocation pathway two semisweet isoforms crystallized one apparently open state one occluded state indicating semisweets sweets transporters undergo rocking-type movements transport cycle topology triple-helix bundle similar yet distinct basic building block animal plant major facilitator superfamily mfs transporters example gluts suts finding indicates two possibilities: sweets mfs transporters evolved ancestral triple-helix bundle triple-helix bundle represents convergent evolution semisweets sweets two triple-helix bundles arranged parallel configuration produce +-transmembranehelix pores respectively transmembrane-helix mfs transporters four triple-helix bundles arranged alternating antiparallel configuration resulting much larger x triplehelix bundle forming pore given similarity semisweets sweets pq-loop amino acid transporters mitochondrial pyruvate carriers mpcs structures characterized may also relevant transporters mtn3 clan- insight gained structures transporters analysis mutations conserved residues will improve understanding transport mechanism well allow comparative studies different superfamilies involved sugar transport evolution transporters general
