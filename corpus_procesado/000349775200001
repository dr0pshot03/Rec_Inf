intracellular sensing complement c3 activates cell autonomous immunity 
pathogens traverse multiple barriers infection including cell membranes found transition pathogens carried covalently attached complement c3 cell triggering immediate signaling effector responses sensing c3 cytosol activated mitochondrial antiviral signaling mavs-dependent signaling cascades induced proinflammatory cytokine secretion c3 also flagged viruses rapid proteasomal degradation preventing replication system detect viral bacterial pathogens antagonized enteroviruses rhinovirus poliovirus cleave c3 using 3c protease antiviral rupintrivir inhibited 3c protease prevented c3 cleavage rendering enteroviruses susceptible intracellular complement sensing thus complement c3 allows cells detect disable pathogens invaded cytosol
