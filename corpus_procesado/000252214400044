ultra-fine frequency tuning revealed single neurons human auditory cortex 
just noticeable differences physical parameters often limited resolution peripheral sensory apparatus thus two point discrimination vision limited size individual photoreceptors frequency selectivity basic property neurons mammalian auditory pathway however just noticeable differences frequency substantially smaller bandwidth peripheral sensors report frequency tuning single neurons recorded human auditory cortex response random chord stimuli far narrower typically described mammalian species besides bats substantially exceeds attributed human auditory periphery interestingly simple spectral filter models failed predict neuronal responses natural stimuli including speech music thus natural sounds engage additional processing mechanisms beyond exquisite frequency tuning probed random chord stimuli
