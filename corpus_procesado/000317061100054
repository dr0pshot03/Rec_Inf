rats humans can optimally accumulate evidence decision-making
gradual noisy accumulation evidence fundamental component decision-making noise playing key role source variability errors however origins noise never determined developed decision-making tasks sensory evidence delivered randomly timed pulses analyzed resulting data models use richly detailed information trials pulse timing distinguish different decision-making mechanisms analysis allowed measurement magnitude noise accumulators memory separately noise associated incoming sensory evidence tasks accumulators memory noiseless rats humans contrast addition new sensory evidence primary source variability suggest task modeling approach powerful method revealing internal properties decision-making processes
