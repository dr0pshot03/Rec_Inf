lmo2-associated clonal t cell proliferation two patients gene therapy scid-x1
previously shown correction x-linked severe combined immunodeficiency [scid-x1 also known gamma chain gammac deficiency] patients retrovirus-mediated gammac gene transfer autologous cd34 bone marrow cells however almost years gene therapy uncontrolled exponential clonal proliferation mature t cells gammadelta+ alphabeta+ t cell receptors occurred two youngest patients patients clones showed retrovirus vector integration proximity lmo2 proto-oncogene promoter leading aberrant transcription expression lmo2 thus retrovirus vector insertion can trigger deregulated premalignant cell proliferation unexpected frequency likely driven retrovirus enhancer activity lmo2 gene promoter
