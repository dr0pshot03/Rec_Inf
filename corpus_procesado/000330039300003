mineralogy mudstone yellowknife bay gale crater mars
sedimentary rocks yellowknife bay gale crater mars include mudstone sampled curiosity rover samples john klein cumberland contain detrital basaltic minerals calcium sulfates iron oxide hydroxides iron sulfides amorphous material trioctahedral smectites john klein smectite basal spacing similar angstroms indicating little interlayer hydration cumberland smectite basal spacing similar similar angstroms larger spacing suggests partially chloritized interlayer interlayer magnesium calcium facilitating h2o retention basaltic minerals mudstone similar nearby eolian deposits however mudstone far less fe-forsterite possibly lost formation smectite plus magnetite late noachian/early hesperian younger age indicates clay mineral formation mars extended beyond noachian time
