generating exploiting polarity bacteria 
bacteria often highly polarized exhibiting specialized structures near ends cell among structures actin-organizing centers mediate movement certain pathogenic bacteria within cytoplasm animal host cell; organized arrays membrane receptors govern chemosensory behavior swimming bacteria; asymmetrically positioned septa generate specialized progeny differentiating bacteria polarization orchestrated complex dynamic changes subcellular localization signal transduction cytoskeleton proteins well specific regions chromosome recent work provided information dynamic subcellular localization occurs exploited bacterial cell
