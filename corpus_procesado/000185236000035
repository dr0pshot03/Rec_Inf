quantum dynamics single vortex 
vortices occur naturally wide range gases fluids macroscopic microscopic scales bose-einstein condensates dilute atomic gases superfluid helium superconductors existence vortices consequence quantum nature system quantized vortices supercurrent generated magnetic flux penetrating material play key role determining material properties performance superconductor-based devices high temperatures dynamics vortices essentially classical low temperatures previous experiments suggested collective quantum dynamics however question whether vortex tunnelling occurs low temperatures addressed large collections vortices study quantum dynamics individual vortex superconducting josephson junction measuring statistics vortex escape controllable pinning potential demonstrate existence quantized levels vortex energy within trapping potential well quantum tunnelling vortex pinning barrier
