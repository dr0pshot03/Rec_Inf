complete nitrification nitrospira bacteria 
nitrification oxidation ammonia via nitrite nitrate always considered two-step process catalysed chemolithoautotrophic microorganisms oxidizing either ammonia nitrite known nitrifier carries steps although complete nitrification energetically advantageous functional separation puzzled microbiologists century report discovery cultivation completely nitrifying bacterium genus nitrospira globally distributed group nitrite oxidizers genome chemolithoautotrophic organism encodes pathways ammonia nitrite oxidation concomitantly expressed growth ammonia oxidation nitrate genes affiliated phylogenetically distinct ammonia monooxygenase hydroxylamine dehydrogenase genes nitrospira present many environments retrieved nitrospira-contigs new metagenomes engineered systems findings fundamentally change picture nitrification point completely nitrifying nitrospira key components nitrogen-cycling microbial communities
