structural basis ribozyme-catalyzed rna assembly
life originated according rna world hypothesis self-replicating ribozymes catalyzed ligation rna fragments solved angstrom crystal structure ligase ribozyme catalyzes regiospecific formation phosphodiester bond -triphosphate -hydroxyl termini two rna fragments invariant residues form tertiary contacts stabilize flexible stem ribozyme ligation site essential magnesium ion coordinates three phosphates structure active site permits us suggest transition-state stabilization general base may catalyze ligation reaction required prebiotic rna assembly
