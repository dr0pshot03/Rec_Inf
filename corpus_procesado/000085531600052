regulation cell fate decision undifferentiated spermatogonia gdnf
molecular control self-renewal differentiation stem cells remained enigmatic transgenic loss-of-function overexpression models now show dosage glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor gdnf produced sertoli cells regulates cell fate decisions undifferentiated spermatogonial cells include stem cells spermatogenesis gene-targeted mice one gdnf-null allele show depletion stem cell reserves whereas mice overexpressing gdnf show accumulation undifferentiated spermatogonia unable respond properly differentiation signals undergo apoptosis upon retinoic acid treatment nonmetastatic testicular tumors regularly formed older gdnf-overexpressing mice thus gdnf contributes paracrine regulation spermatogonial self-renewal differentiation
