structure dnmt1-dna complex reveals role autoinhibition maintenance dna methylation 
maintenance genomic methylation patterns mediated primarily dna methyltransferase dnmt1 solved structures mouse human dnmt1 composed cxxc tandem bromo-adjacent homology bah1/ methyltransferase domains bound dna-containing unmethylated cpg sites cxxc specifically binds unmethylated cpg dinucleotide positions cxxc-bah1 linker dna active site dnmt1 preventing de novo methylation addition loop projecting bah2 interacts target recognition domain trd methyltransferase stabilizing trd retracted position preventing inserting dna major groove studies identify autoinhibitory mechanism unmethylated cpg dinucleotides occluded active site ensure hemimethylated cpg dinucleotides undergo methylation
