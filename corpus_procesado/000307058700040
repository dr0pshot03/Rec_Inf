reversible higher-rate li-o battery 
rechargeable nonaqueous lithium-air li-o- battery receiving great deal interest theoretically specific energy far exceeds best can achieved lithium-ion cells operation rechargeable li-o battery depends critically repeated highly reversible formation/decomposition lithium peroxide li2o2 cathode upon cycling show process possible use dimethyl sulfoxide electrolyte porous gold electrode % capacity retention cycles whereas previously partial li2o2 formation/decomposition limited cycling occur furthermore present data indicating kinetics li2o2 oxidation charge approximately times faster carbon electrodes
