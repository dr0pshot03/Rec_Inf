dpp spreading required medial lateral wing disc growth
drosophila decapentaplegic dpp served paradigm study morphogen-dependent growth control however role dpp gradient tissue growth remains highly controversial two fundamentally different models proposed: temporal rule model suggests cells wing imaginal disc divide upon % increase dpp signalling whereas growth equalization model suggests dpp essential proliferation control central cells discriminate two models generated used morphotrap membrane-tethered anti-green fluorescent protein gfp nanobody enables immobilization enhanced egfp:: dpp cell surface thereby abolishing dpp gradient formation find absence dpp spreading wing disc patterning lost however lateral cells still divide normal rates data consistent growth equalization model fit global temporal rule model wing imaginal disc
