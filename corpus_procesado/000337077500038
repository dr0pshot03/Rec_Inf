nonhuman genetics strong male bias drives germline mutation chimpanzees
germline mutation determines rates molecular evolution genetic diversity fitness load humans average point mutation rate x - per base pair per generation every additional year fathers age contributing two mutations across genome males contributing three four times many mutations females assess whether patterns shared closest living relatives sequenced genomes nine-member pedigree western chimpanzees pan troglodytes verus results indicate mutation rate x - per base pair per generation male contribution seven eight times females paternal age effect three mutations per year fathers age thus mutation rates patterns differ closely related species
