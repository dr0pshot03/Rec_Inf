essential role histone methyltransferase g9a cocaine-induced plasticity
cocaine-induced alterations gene expression cause changes neuronal morphology behavior may underlie cocaine addiction mice identified essential role histone lysine h3k9 dimethylation lysine dimethyltransferase g9a cocaine-induced structural behavioral plasticity repeated cocaine administration reduced global levels h3k9 dimethylation nucleus accumbens reduction histone methylation mediated repression g9a brain region regulated cocaine-induced transcription factor delta fosb using conditional mutagenesis viral-mediated gene transfer found g9a down-regulation increased dendritic spine plasticity nucleus accumbens neurons enhanced preference cocaine thereby establishing crucial role histone methylation long-term actions cocaine
