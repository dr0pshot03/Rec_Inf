gene product murr1 restricts hiv replication resting cd4+ lymphocytes 
although human immunodeficiency virus hiv- infects quiescent proliferating cd4+ lymphocytes virus replicates poorly resting t cells- factors block viral replication cells might help prolong asymptomatic phase hiv infection however molecular mechanisms control process fully understood show murr1 gene product known previously involvement copper regulation inhibits hiv growth unstimulated cd4+ t cells inhibition mediated part ability inhibit basal cytokine-stimulated nuclear factor nf-kappab activity knockdown murr1 increased nf-kappab activity decreased ikappab-alpha concentrations facilitating phospho-ikappab-alpha degradation proteasome murr1 detected cd4+ t cells rna-mediated interference murr1 primary resting cd4+ lymphocytes increased hiv replication effects proteasome murr1 acts genetic restriction factor inhibits hiv replication lymphocytes contribute regulation asymptomatic hiv infection progression aids
