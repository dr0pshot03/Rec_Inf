reversing pathological neural activity using targeted plasticity
brain changes response nerve damage cochlear trauma can generate pathological neural activity believed responsible many types chronic pain tinnitus- several studies reported severity chronic pain tinnitus correlated degree map reorganization somatosensory auditory cortex respectively direct electrical transcranial magnetic stimulation sensory cortex can temporarily disrupt phantom sensations however yet direct evidence causal role plasticity generation pain tinnitus report evidence reversing brain changes responsible can eliminate perceptual impairment animal model noise-induced tinnitus exposure intense noise degrades frequency tuning auditory cortex neurons increases cortical synchronization repeatedly pairing tones brief pulses vagus nerve stimulation completely eliminated physiological behavioural correlates tinnitus noise-exposed rats improvements persisted weeks end therapy method restoring neural activity normal may applicable variety neurological disorders
