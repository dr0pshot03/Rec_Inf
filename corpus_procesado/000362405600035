erosion alpine glacier 
assessing impact glaciation earths surface requires understanding glacial erosion processes developing erosion theories challenging complex nature erosion processes difficulty examining ice/bedrock interface contemporary glaciers demonstrate glacial erosion rate proportional ice-sliding velocity squared quantifying spatial variations ice-sliding velocity erosion rate fast-flowing alpine glacier nonlinear behavior implies high erosion sensitivity small variations topographic slope precipitation nonlinear rate law suggests abrasion may dominate erosion processes fast-flowing glaciers may also explain wide range observed glacial erosion rates part impact glaciation mountainous landscapes past million years
