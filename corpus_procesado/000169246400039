four final rotation states venus 
venus rotates slowly axis retrograde direction opposite bodies solar system1 explain peculiar observation generally believed2- past rotational axis rotated degrees result core-mantle friction inside planet together atmospheric tides change assume high initial obliquity angle planets equator plane orbital motion chaotic evolution7 however allows spin axis flip large set initial conditions68 show independent uncertainties models terrestrial planets dense atmosphere like venus can evolve one four possible rotation states moreover rnd initial conditions will drive planet towards configuration present seen venus albeit two different evolutionary paths first generally accepted view whereby spin axis flips direction2- also found possible venus begin prograde rotation direction planets yet develop retrograde rotation obliquity goes towards zero9 : rotation spin axis necessary case
