evolutionary resurrection flagellar motility via rewiring nitrogen regulation system
central process evolution recruitment genes regulatory networks engineered immotile strains bacterium pseudomonas fluorescens lack flagella due deletion regulatory gene fleq strong selection motility bacteria consistently regained flagella within hours via two-step evolutionary pathway step mutations increase intracellular levels phosphorylated ntrc distant homolog fleq begins commandeer control fleq regulon cost disrupting nitrogen uptake assimilation step switch-of-function mutation redirects ntrc away nitrogen uptake toward novel function flagellar regulator results demonstrate natural selection can rapidly rewire regulatory networks repeatable mutational steps
