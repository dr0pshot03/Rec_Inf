water hydrophobic surfaces: weak hydrogen bonding strong orientation effects
vibrational studies selectively probe molecular structure ccl4/h2o hydrocarbon/h2o interfaces show hydrogen bonding adjacent water molecules interfaces weak contrast generally accepted models water next fluid hydrophobic surfaces suggest strong hydrogen bonding however interactions water molecules organic phase result substantial orientation weakly hydrogen-bonded water molecules interfacial region results important implications understanding water adjacent hydrophobic surfaces penetration water hydrophobic phases
