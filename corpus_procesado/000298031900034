unusual gamma-ray burst grb 101225a explained minor body falling onto neutron star
tidal disruption solar-mass star around supermassive black hole extensively studied analytically numerically events star develops elongated banana-shaped structure completing eccentric orbit bound debris falls black hole forming accretion disk emitting radiation- process may occur planetary scales minor body passes close star solar system comets fall directly sun onto planets star compact object minor body can become tidally disrupted indeed one first mechanisms invoked produce strong gamma-ray emission involved accretion comets onto neutron stars galaxy report peculiarities christmas gamma-ray burst grb 101225a can explained tidal disruption event minor body around isolated galactic neutron star indicate either minor bodies can captured compact stellar remnants frequently occurs solar system minor-body formation relatively easy around millisecond radio pulsars peculiar supernova associated gamma-ray burst provides alternative explanation
