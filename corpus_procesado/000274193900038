new highly penetrant form obesity due deletions chromosome 16p11
obesity become major worldwide challenge public health owing interaction western obesogenic environment strong genetic contribution recent extensive genome-wide association studies gwass identified numerous single nucleotide polymorphisms associated obesity loci together account small fraction known heritable component thus common disease common variant hypothesis increasingly coming challenge report highly penetrant form obesity initially observed subjects heterozygous deletions least kilobases 16p11 whose ascertainment included cognitive deficits nineteen similar deletions identified gwas data individuals eight european cohorts deletions absent healthy non-obese controls accounted % morbid obesity cases body mass index bmi > kg m- bmi standard deviation score > p x - odds ratio demonstrating potential importance common disease rare variants strong effects highlights promising strategy identifying missing heritability obesity complex traits: cohorts extreme phenotypes likely enriched rare variants thereby improving power discovery subsequent analysis loci identified may well reveal additional rare variants contribute missing heritability recently reported sim1 ref productive approach may therefore combine power extreme small well-phenotyped cohorts targeted follow-up case-control population cohorts
