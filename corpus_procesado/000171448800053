uniform binding aminoacyl-trnas elongation factor tu thermodynamic compensation
elongation factor tu ef-tu binds elongator aminoacyl-transfer rnas aa-trnas delivery ribosome protein synthesis show ef-tu binds misacylated trnas much wider range affinities binds corresponding correctly acylated trnas suggesting protein exhibits considerable specificity amino acid side chain trna body thermodynamic contributions amino acid trna body overall binding affinity independent compensate one another trnas correctly acylated certain misacylated trnas bind ef-tu significantly strongly weakly cognate aa-trnas ef-tu may contribute translational accuracy
