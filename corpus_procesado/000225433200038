cold dust within supernova remnant cassiopeia
large amount three solar masses cold k dust prototypical type ii supernova remnant cassiopeia recently reported concluded dust production type ii supernovae can explain large quantities similar to10 solar masses dust observed distant quasars produced within million years big bang foreground clouds interstellar material however complicate interpretation earlier submillimetre observations cas report far-infrared molecular line observations demonstrate detected submillimetre emission originates interstellar dust molecular cloud complex located line sight earth cas therefore associated remnant argument type ii supernovae produce copious amounts dust supported case cas previously appeared provide best evidence possibility
