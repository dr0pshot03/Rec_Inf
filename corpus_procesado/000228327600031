common sex-dependent mutation ret enhancer underlies hirschsprung disease risk 
identification common variants contribute genesis human inherited disorders remains significant challenge hirschsprung disease hscr multifactorial non-mendelian disorder rare high-penetrance coding sequence mutations receptor tyrosine kinase ret contribute risk combination mutations genes used family-based association studies identify disease interval integrated comparative functional genomic analysis prioritize conserved functional elements within mutations can sought now show common non-coding ret variant within conserved enhancer-like sequence intron significantly associated hscr susceptibility makes -fold greater contribution risk rare alleles mutation reduces vitro enhancer activity markedly low penetrance different genetic effects males females explains several features complex inheritance pattern hscr thus common low-penetrance variants identified association studies can underlie common rare diseases
