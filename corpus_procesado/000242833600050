p[acman]: bac transgenic platform targeted insertion large dna fragments d-melanogaster
describe transgenesis platform drosophila melanogaster integrates three recently developed technologies: conditionally amplifiable bacterial artificial chromosome bac recombineering bacteriophage phi c31-mediated transgenesis bac maintained low copy number facilitating plasmid maintenance recombineering induced high copy number plasmid isolation recombineering allows gap repair mutagenesis bacteria gap repair efficiently retrieves dna fragments kilobases long p1 bac clones phi c31-mediated transgenesis integrates large dna fragments specific sites genome allowing rescue lethal mutations corresponding genes transgenesis platform greatly facilitate structure/function analyses drosophila genes
