hormone resistin links obesity diabetes 
diabetes mellitus chronic disease leads complications including heart disease stroke kidney failure blindness nerve damage type diabetes characterized target-tissue resistance insulin epidemic industrialized societies strongly associated obesity however mechanism increased adiposity causes insulin resistance unclear show adipocytes secrete unique signalling molecule named resistin resistance insulin circulating resistin levels decreased anti-diabetic drug rosiglitazone increased diet-induced genetic forms obesity administration anti-resistin antibody improves blood sugar insulin action mice diet-induced obesity moreover treatment normal mice recombinant resistin impairs glucose tolerance insulin action insulin-stimulated glucose uptake adipocytes enhanced neutralization resistin reduced resistin treatment resistin thus hormone potentially links obesity diabetes
