stabilizing rabi oscillations superconducting qubit using quantum feedback 
act measurement bridges quantum classical worlds projecting superposition possible states single probabilistic outcome timescale instantaneous process can stretched using weak measurements takes form gradual random walk towards final state remarkably interim measurement record sufficient continuously track steer quantum state using feedback- implement quantum feedback control solid-state system namely superconducting quantum bit qubit coupled microwave cavity weak measurement qubit implemented probing cavity microwave photons maintaining average occupation less one photon photons directed high-bandwidth quantum-noise-limited amplifier allows real-time monitoring state cavity hence qubit high fidelity demonstrate quantum feedback control inhibiting decay rabi oscillations allowing persist indefinitely ability permits active suppression decoherence enables method quantum error correction based weak continuous measurements applications include quantum state stabilization entanglement generation using measurement state purification adaptive measurements
