commensal bifidobacterium promotes antitumor immunity facilitates anti-pd-l1 efficacy 
t cell infiltration solid tumors associated favorable patient outcomes yet mechanisms underlying variable immune responses individuals well understood one possible modulator intestinal microbiota compared melanoma growth mice harboring distinct commensal microbiota observed differences spontaneous antitumor immunity eliminated upon cohousing fecal transfer sequencing 16s ribosomal rna identified bifidobacterium associated antitumor effects oral administration bifidobacterium alone improved tumor control degree programmed cell death protein ligand pd-l1-specific antibody therapy checkpoint blockade combination treatment nearly abolished tumor outgrowth augmented dendritic cell function leading enhanced cd8+ t cell priming accumulation tumor microenvironment mediated effect data suggest manipulating microbiota may modulate cancer immunotherapy
