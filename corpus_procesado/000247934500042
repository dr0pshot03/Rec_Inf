derivation pluripotent epiblast stem cells mammalian embryos 
although first mouse embryonic stem es cell lines derived years ago using feeder-layer-based blastocyst cultures subsequent efforts extend approach mammals including laboratory domestic species relatively unsuccessful notable exceptions derivation non-human primate es cell lines followed shortly thereafter derivation human es cells despite apparent common origin similar pluripotency mouse human embryonic stem cells recent studies revealed use different signalling pathways maintain pluripotent status mouse es cells depend leukaemia inhibitory factor bone morphogenetic protein whereas human counterparts rely activin inhba/nodal nodal fibroblast growth factor fgf show pluripotent stem cells can derived late epiblast layer post-implantation mouse rat embryos using chemically defined activin-containing culture medium sufficient long-term maintenance human embryonic stem cells results demonstrate activin/nodal signalling evolutionarily conserved role derivation maintenance pluripotency novel stem cells epiblast stem cells provide valuable experimental system determining whether distinctions mouse human embryonic stem cells reflect species differences diverse temporal origins
