histone chaperone caf- safeguards somatic cell identity 
cellular differentiation involves profound remodelling chromatic landscapes yet mechanisms somatic cell identity subsequently maintained remain incompletely understood elucidate regulatory pathways safeguard somatic state performed two comprehensive rna interference rnai screens targeting chromatin factors transcription-factor-mediated reprogramming mouse fibroblasts induced pluripotent stem cells ips cells subunits chromatin assembly factor- caf- complex including chaf1a chaf1b emerged prominent hits screens followed modulators lysine sumoylation heterochromatin maintenance optimal modulation caf- transcription factor levels increased reprogramming efficiency several orders magnitude facilitated ips cell formation little days mechanistically caf- suppression led accessible chromatin structure enhancer elements early reprogramming changes accompanied decrease somatic heterochromatin domains increased binding sox2 pluripotency-specific targets activation associated genes notably suppression caf- also enhanced direct conversion b cells macrophages fibroblasts neurons together findings reveal histone chaperone caf- novel regulator somatic cell identity transcription-factor-induced cell-fate transitions provide potential strategy modulate cellular plasticity regenerative setting
