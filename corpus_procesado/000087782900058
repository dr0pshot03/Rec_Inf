bacterial mode replication eukaryotic-like machinery hyperthermophilic archaeon
despite rapid increase amount available archaeal sequence information little known duplication genetic material third domain life identified single origin bidirectional replication pyrococcus abyssi means silico analyses cumulative oligomer skew identification early replicating chromosomal segment replication origin three pyrococcus species found highly conserved several eukaryotic-like dna replication genes clustered around bacteria chromosomal region containing replication terminus hot spot genome shuffling thus although bacterial archaeal replication proteins differ profoundly used replicate chromosomes similar manner prokaryotic domains
