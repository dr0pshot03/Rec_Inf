beating superparamagnetic limit exchange bias 
interest magnetic nanoparticles increased past years virtue potential applications fields ultrahigh-density recording medicine1- applications rely magnetic order nanoparticles stable time however decreasing particle size magnetic anisotropy energy per particle responsible holding magnetic moment along certain directions becomes comparable thermal energy happens thermal fluctuations induce random flipping magnetic moment time nanoparticles lose stable magnetic order become superparamagnetic5 thus demand miniaturization comes conflict superparamagnetism caused reduction anisotropy energy per particle: constitutes so-called superparamagnetic limit67 recording media show magnetic exchange coupling induced interface ferromagnetic antiferromagnetic systems89 can provide extra source anisotropy leading magnetization stability demonstrate principle ferromagnetic cobalt nanoparticles nm diameter embedded either paramagnetic antiferromagnetic matrix whereas cobalt cores lose magnetic moment k first system remain ferromagnetic k second behaviour ascribed specific way ferromagnetic nanoparticles couple antiferromagnetic matrix
