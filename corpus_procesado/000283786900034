quantum gravitational contributions quantum electrodynamics
quantum electrodynamics describes interactions electrons photons electric charge gauge coupling constant energy dependent previous claim charge affected gravity described general relativity implication charge reduced high energies however claim controversial matter settled report analysis free earlier controversies demonstrating quantum gravity corrections quantum electrodynamics quadratic energy dependence result electric charge vanishing high energies result known asymptotic freedom
