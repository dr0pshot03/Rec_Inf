probing graphene grain boundaries optical microscopy
grain boundaries graphene formed joining islands initial growth stage boundaries govern transport properties related device performance although information atomic rearrangement graphene grain boundaries can obtained using transmission electron microscopy scanning tunnelling microscopy- large-scale information regarding distribution graphene grain boundaries easily accessible use optical microscopy observe grain boundaries large-area graphene grown copper foil directly without transfer graphene imaging technique realized selectively oxidizing underlying copper foil graphene grain boundaries functionalized o oh radicals generated ultraviolet irradiation moisture-rich ambient conditions: selective diffusion oxygen radicals oh-functionalized defect sites demonstrated density functional calculations sheet resistance large-area graphene decreased graphene grain sizes increased strong correlation grain size copper revealed contrast previous report furthermore influence graphene grain boundaries crack propagation initialized bending termination clearly visualized using technique approach can used simple protocol evaluating grain boundaries two-dimensional layered structures boron nitride exfoliated clays
