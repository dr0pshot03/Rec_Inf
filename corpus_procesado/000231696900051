ionic colloidal crystals oppositely charged particles 
colloidal suspensions widely used study processes melting freezing- glass transitions display phase behaviour atoms molecules nano micrometre size colloidal particles making possible observe directly real space another attractive feature different types colloidal interactions long-range repulsive short-range attractive hard-sphere-like- dipolar can realized give rise equilibrium phases however spherically symmetric long-range attractions ionic interactions far always resulted irreversible colloidal aggregation show electrostatic interaction oppositely charged particles can tuned large ionic colloidal crystals form readily theory simulations confirming stability structures find contrast atomic systems stoichiometry colloidal crystals dictated charge neutrality allows us obtain remarkable diversity new binary structures external electric field melts crystals confirming constituent particles indeed oppositely charged colloidal model systems can thus used study phase behaviour ionic species also expect approach controlling opposite-charge interactions will facilitate production binary crystals micrometre-sized particles find use advanced materials photonic applications
