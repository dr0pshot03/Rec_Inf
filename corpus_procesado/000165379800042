macroscopic fibers ribbons oriented carbon nanotubes
simple method used assemble single-walled carbon nanotubes indefinitely long ribbons fibers processing consists dispersing nanotubes surfactant solutions recondensing nanotubes flow polymer solution form nanotube mesh collating mesh nanotube fiber flow-induced alignment may lead preferential orientation nanotubes mesh form ribbon unlike classical carbon fibers nanotube fibers can strongly bent without breaking obtained elastic modulus times higher modulus high-quality bucky paper
