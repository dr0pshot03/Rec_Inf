although crystal structures copper oxide high-temperature superconductors complex diverse contain crystal planes consisting copper oxygen atoms square lattice: superconductivity believed originate strongly interacting electrons cuo2 planes substituting single impurity atom copper atom strongly perturbs surrounding electronic environment can therefore used probe high-temperature superconductivity atomic scale provided motivation several experimental- theoretical studies- scanning tunnelling microscopy stm ideal technique study effects atomic scale used successfully probe individual impurity atoms several systems- use stm investigate effects individual zinc impurity atoms high-temperature superconductor bi2sr2cacu2o8+delta find intense quasiparticle scattering resonances zn sites coincident strong suppression superconductivity within similar angstrom scattering sites imaging spatial dependence quasiparticle density states vicinity impurity atoms reveals long-sought four-fold symmetric quasiparticle cloud aligned nodes d-wave superconducting gap believed characterize superconductivity materials
