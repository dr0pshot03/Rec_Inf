listeria intracellular growth virulence require host-derived lipoic acid 
listeria monocytogenes gram-positive intracytosolic pathogen causes severe disease pregnant immunocompromised individuals found l monocytogenes lacking lipoate protein ligase lpla1 defective growth specifically host cytosol less virulent animals factor major target lpla1 e2 subunit pyruvate dehydrogenase pdh lacked critical lipoyl modi cation deltalpla1 strain grown intracellularly suggests abortive growth due loss pdh function thus use host-derived lipoic acid may critical process vivo replication bacterial pathogens
