global distribution conservation rare threatened vertebrates 
global conservation strategies commonly assume different taxonomic groups show congruent geographical patterns diversity distribution extinction-prone species one group can therefore act surrogate vulnerable species groups conservation decisions made1- validity assumptions remains unclear however previous tests limited geographical taxonomic extent5- use database global distribution living bird mammal amphibian species show although distribution overall species richness similar among groups congruence distribution rare threatened species markedly lower congruence especially low among rarest species cross-taxon congruence also highly scale dependent particularly low finer spatial resolutions relevant real protected areas hotspots rarity threat therefore largely non-overlapping across groups areas chosen maximize species complementarity overall results indicate silver-bullet conservation strategies alone will deliver efficient conservation solutions instead priority areas biodiversity conservation must based high-resolution data multiple taxa
