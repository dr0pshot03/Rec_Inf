clonal evolution breast cancer revealed single nucleus genome sequencing 
sequencing studies breast tumour cohorts identified many prevalent mutations provide limited insight genomic diversity within tumours developed whole-genome exome single cell sequencing approach called nuc-seq uses g2/m nuclei achieve % mean coverage breadth applied method sequence single normal tumour nuclei oestrogen-receptor-positiveer+ breast cancer triple-negative ductal carcinoma parallel performed single nuclei copy number profiling data show aneuploid rearrangements occurred early tumour evolution remained highly stable tumour masses clonally expanded contrast point mutations evolved gradually generating extensive clonal diversity using targeted single-molecule sequencing many diverse mutations shown occur low frequencies <% tumour mass using mathematical modelling found triple-negative tumour cells increased mutation rate 133x whereas er+ tumour cells findings important implications diagnosis therapeutic treatment evolution chemoresistance breast cancer
