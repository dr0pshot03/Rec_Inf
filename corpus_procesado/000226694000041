dark structures molecular radiationless transitions determined ultrafast diffraction 
intermediate structures formed radiationless transitions termed "dark" existence inferred indirectly radiative transitions used ultrafast electron diffraction directly determine transient structures ground-state excited-state potential energy surfaces several aromatic molecules resolution space time angstrom picosecond enables differentiation competing nonradiative pathways bond breaking vibronic coupling spin transition systems reported results reveal unexpected dynamical behavior observed ring opening structure depends molecular substituents together parallel bifurcation physical chemical channels redefines structural dynamics energy landscape radiationless processes
