transient regenerative potential neonatal mouse heart
certain fish amphibians retain robust capacity cardiac regeneration throughout life true adult mammalian heart whether capacity cardiac regeneration absent mammals whether exists switched early birth unclear found hearts day-old neonatal mice can regenerate partial surgical resection capacity lost days age regenerative response day-old mice characterized cardiomyocyte proliferation minimal hypertrophy fibrosis thereby distinguishing repair processes genetic fate mapping indicated majority cardiomyocytes within regenerated tissue originated preexisting cardiomyocytes echocardiography performed months surgery revealed regenerated ventricular apex normal systolic function thus brief period birth mammalian heart appears capacity regenerate
