marine fixation atmospheric nitrogen believed important source biologically useful nitrogen ocean surface waters1 stimulating productivity phytoplankton influencing global carbon cycle2 majority nitrogen fixation tropical waters carried marine cyanobacterium trichodesmium3 supplies half new nitrogen used primary production4 although factors controlling marine nitrogen fixation remain poorly understood thought nitrogen fixation limited iron availability ocean25 inferred high iron requirement estimated growth nitrogen fixing organisms6 higher apparent densities trichodesmium aeolian iron inputs plentiful7 report nitrogen fixation rates central atlantic appear independent dissolved iron levels sea water iron content trichodesmium colonies nitrogen fixation instead highly correlated phosphorus content trichodesmium enhanced higher irradiance furthermore calculations suggest structural iron requirement growth nitrogen-fixing organisms much lower previously calculated6 although iron deficiency still potentially limit growth nitrogen-fixing organisms regions low iron availability-for example subtropical north pacific ocean-our observations suggest marine nitrogen fixation solely regulated iron supply
