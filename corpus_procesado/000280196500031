ruling multi-order interference quantum mechanics
quantum mechanics gravitation two pillars modern physics despite success describing physical world around us seem incompatible theories suggestions one theories must generalized achieve unification example borns rule-one axioms quantum mechanics-could violated borns rule predicts quantum interference shown double-slit diffraction experiment occurs pairs paths generalized version quantum mechanics might allow multipath ie higher-order interference thus leading deviation theory performed three-slit experiment photons bounded magnitude three-path interference less - expected two-path interference thus ruling third-and higher-order interference providing bound accuracy borns rule experiment consistent postulate semiclassical quantum regimes
