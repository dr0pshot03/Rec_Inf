necessary sufficient egg activation fertilization
early steps lead rise calcium egg activation fertilization unknown great interest-particularly advent vitro fertilization techniques treating male infertility whole-animal cloning nuclear transfer calcium rise required egg activation subsequent events development eggs species injection intact sperm sperm extracts can activate eggs suggesting sperm-derived factors may involved show nitric oxide synthase present high concentration active sperm activation acrosome reaction increase nitrosation within eggs evident seconds insemination precedes calcium pulse fertilization microinjection nitric oxide donors recombinant nitric oxide synthase recapitulates events egg activation whereas prior injection oxyhaemoglobin physiological nitric oxide scavenger prevents egg activation fertilization conclude nitric oxide synthase nitric-oxide-related bioactivity satisfy primary criteria egg activator: present appropriate place active appropriate time necessary sufficient successful fertilization
