dna-functionalized nanotube membranes single-base mismatch selectivity
describe synthetic membranes molecular recognition chemistry used accomplish selective permeation dna hybridization membranes contain template-synthesized gold nanotubes inside diameters nanometers transporter dna-hairpin molecule attached inside walls nanotubes dna-functionalized nanotube membranes selectively recognize transport dna strand complementary transporter strand relative dna strands complementary transporter optimal conditions single-base mismatch transport selectivity can obtained
