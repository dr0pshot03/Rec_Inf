t-cell-expressed proprotein convertase furin essential maintenance peripheral immune tolerance
furin one seven proprotein convertase family members promote proteolytic maturation proproteins induced activated t cells reported process variety substrates including anti inflammatory cytokine transforming growth factor tgf-beta refs non redundant functions furin versus proprotein convertases t cells unclear show conditional deletion furin t cells allowed normal t cell development impaired function regulatory effector t cells produced less tgf-beta furin-deficient t regulatory t-reg cells less protective t cell transfer colitis model failed induce foxp3 normal t cells additionally furin deficient effector cells inherently over-active resistant suppressive activity wild type t-reg cells thus results indicate furin indispensable maintaining peripheral tolerance due least part non redundant essential function regulating tgf-beta production targeting furin emerged strategy malignant infectious disease results suggest inhibiting furin might activate immune responses may result breakdown peripheral tolerance
