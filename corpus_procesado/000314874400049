multiplex genome engineering using crispr/cas systems 
functional elucidation causal genetic variants elements requires precise genome editing technologies type ii prokaryotic crispr clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/cas adaptive immune system shown facilitate rna-guided site-specific dna cleavage engineered two different type ii crispr/cas systems demonstrate cas9 nucleases can directed short rnas induce precise cleavage endogenous genomic loci human mouse cells cas9 can also converted nicking enzyme facilitate homology-directed repair minimal mutagenic activity lastly multiple guide sequences can encoded single crispr array enable simultaneous editing several sites within mammalian genome demonstrating easy programmability wide applicability rna-guided nuclease technology
