centrosome-independent role gamma-turc proteins spindle assembly checkpoint
spindle assembly checkpoint guards fidelity chromosome segregation requires close cooperation cell cycle regulatory proteins cytoskeletal elements sense spindle integrity role centrosome organizing center microtubule cytoskeleton spindle checkpoint unclear found molecular requirements functional spindle checkpoint included components large gamma-tubulin ring complex gamma-turc however localization centrosome centrosome integrity essential function thus spindle checkpoint can activated level microtubule nucleation
