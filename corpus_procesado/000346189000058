shocking predatory strike electric eel 
electric eels can incapacitate prey electric discharge mechanism eels attack unknown series experiments show eel high-voltage discharges can activate prey motor neurons hence muscles allowing eels remotely control target eels prevent escape free-swimming prey using high-frequency volleys induce immobilizing whole-body muscle contraction tetanus prey hidden eels can emit periodic volleys two three discharges cause massive involuntary twitch revealing preys location eliciting full tetanus-inducing volley temporal patterns eel electrical discharges resemble motor neuron activity induces fast muscle contraction suggesting eel high-voltage volleys selected efficiently induce involuntary muscle contraction nearby animals
