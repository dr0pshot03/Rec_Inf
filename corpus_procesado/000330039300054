transmissable dog cancer genome reveals origin history ancient cell lineage
canine transmissible venereal tumor ctvt oldest known somatic cell lineage transmissible cancer propagates naturally dogs sequenced genomes two ctvt tumors found ctvt acquired million somatic substitution mutations bears evidence exposure ultraviolet light ctvt remarkably stable lacks subclonal heterogeneity despite thousands rearrangements copy-number changes retrotransposon insertions genes carry nonsynonymous variants genes lost ctvt first arose dog low genomic heterozygosity may lived years ago cancer spawned individual dispersed across continents years ago results provide genetic identikit ancient dog demonstrate robustness mammalian somatic cells survive millennia despite massive mutation burden
