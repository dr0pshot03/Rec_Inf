arrangement chemical elements periodic table highlights resemblances chemical properties reflect elements electronic structure heaviest elements however deviations periodicity chemical properties expected-: electrons orbitals high probability density near nucleus accelerated large nuclear charges relativistic velocities increase binding energies cause orbital contraction leads efficient screening nuclear charge corresponding destabilization outer d f orbitals: changes can give rise unexpected chemical properties synthesis increasingly heavy elements- now including elements allows investigation effect provided sufficiently long-lived isotopes chemical characterization available case elements example relativistic effects interrupt characteristic trends chemical properties elements constituting corresponding columns periodic table whereas element behaves accordance expected periodicity- report chemical separation characterization six atoms element bohrium bh form oxychloride find compound less volatile oxychlorides lighter elements group vii thus confirming relativistic calculations predict behaviour bohrium like element coincide expected basis position periodic table
