gas phase observation microwave spectroscopic characterization formic sulfuric anhydride 
report observation covalently bound species formic sulfuric anhydride fsa produced formic acid sulfur trioxide supersonic jet conditions fsa structurally characterized means microwave spectroscopy investigated using density functional theory ab initio calculations theory indicates pi2 + pi2 + sigma2 cycloaddition reaction so3 hcooh plausible pathway fsa formation mechanism effectively barrierless speculate possible role fsa may play earths atmosphere
