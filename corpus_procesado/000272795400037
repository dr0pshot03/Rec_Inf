single sub-kilometre kuiper belt object stellar occultation archival data
kuiper belt remnant primordial solar system measurements size distribution constrain accretion collisional history importance material strength kuiper belt objects- small sub-kilometre-sized kuiper belt objects elude direct detection signature occultations background stars detectable- observations optical x-ray wavelengths claim detected occultations implied abundances inconsistent far exceed theoretical expectations report analysis archival data reveals occultation body approximately metre radius distance astronomical units probability event arising random statistical fluctuations within data set two per cent survey yields surface density kuiper belt objects radii exceeding metres -+ x deg- ruling inferred surface densities previous claimed detections sigma detection one event reveals deficit sub-kilometre-sized kuiper belt objects compared population extrapolated objects radii exceeding kilometres implies sub-kilometre-sized objects undergoing collisional erosion just like debris disks observed around stars
