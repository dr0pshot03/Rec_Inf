gravitationally lensed water maser early universe 
water masers- found dense molecular clouds closely associated supermassive black holes centres active galaxies basis understanding local water maser luminosity function expected masers intermediate high redshifts extremely rare however galaxies redshifts z > might quite different found locally least frequent mergers interaction events use gravitational lensing search masers higher redshifts otherwise possible find water maser redshift dust gas rich gravitationally lensed type quasar mgj0414+ refs isotropic luminosity 000ll solar luminosity twice powerful local water maser half distant maser previously known using locally determined luminosity function5 probability finding maser luminous associated single active galaxy - fact see maser first galaxy observe must mean volume densities luminosities masers higher redshift
