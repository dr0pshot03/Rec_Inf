plasma membrane compartmentalization yeast messenger rna transport septin diffusion barrier
asymmetric localization proteins plays key role many cellular processes including cell polarity cell fate determination using dna microarray analysis identified plasma membrane protein-encoding mrna ist2 transported bud tip actomyosin-based process mrna localization created higher concentration ist2 protein bud compared mother cell asymmetry maintained septin-mediated membrane diffusion barrier mother-bud neck results indicate thar yeast creates distinct plasma membrane compartments described neurons epithelial cells
