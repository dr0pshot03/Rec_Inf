cryptic sensor hiv activates antiviral innate immunity dendritic cells 
dendritic cells serve key function host defence linking innate detection microbes activation pathogen-specific adaptive immune responses whether cell-intrinsic recognition human immunodeficiency virus hiv host innate pattern-recognition receptors subsequent coupling antiviral t-cell responses yet known dendritic cells largely resistant infection hiv- facilitate infection co-cultured t-helper cells process trans-enhancement show dendritic cell resistance infection circumvented hiv induces dendritic cell maturation antiviral type interferon response activation t cells innate response dependent interaction newly synthesized hiv capsid cellular cyclophilin cypa subsequent activation transcription factor irf3 peptidylprolyl isomerase cypa also interacts hiv capsid promote infectivity results indicate capsid conformation evolved opposing selective pressures infectivity versus furtiveness thus cell-intrinsic sensor hiv exists dendritic cells mediates antiviral immune response typically engaged owing absence dendritic cell infection virulence hiv may related evasion response manipulation may necessary generate effective hiv vaccine
