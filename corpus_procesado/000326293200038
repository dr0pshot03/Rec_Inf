arteriolar niches maintain haematopoietic stem cell quiescence 
cell cycle quiescence critical feature contributing haematopoietic stem cell hsc maintenance although various candidate stromal cells identified potential hsc niches spatial localization quiescent hscs bone marrow remains unclear using novel approach combines whole-mount confocal immunofluorescence imaging techniques computational modelling analyse significant three-dimensional associations mouse bone marrow among vascular structures stromal cells hscs show quiescent hscs associate specifically small arterioles preferentially found endosteal bone marrow arterioles ensheathed exclusively rare ng2 also known cspg4+ pericytes distinct sinusoid-associated leptin receptor lepr+ cells pharmacological genetic activation hsc cell cycle alters distribution hscs ng2+ periarteriolar niches lepr+ perisinusoidal niches conditional depletion ng2+ cells induces hsc cycling reduces functional long-term repopulating hscs bone marrow results thus indicate arteriolar niches indispensable maintaining hsc quiescence
