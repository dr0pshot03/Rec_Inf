controlled collisions multi-particle entanglement optically trapped atoms
entanglement lies heart quantum mechanics recent years identified essential resource quantum information processing computation- experimentally challenging production highly entangled multi-particle states therefore important investigating fundamental physics practical applications report creation highly entangled states neutral atoms trapped periodic potential optical lattice controlled collisions individual neighbouring atoms used realize array quantum gates massively parallel operation observe coherent entangling disentangling evolution many-body system depending phase shift acquired collision neighbouring atoms dynamics indicative highly entangled many-body states moreover formed single operational step independent size system
