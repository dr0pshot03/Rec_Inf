real-time evolution new genes innovation amplification divergence
gene duplications allow evolution genes new functions describe innovation-amplification-divergence iad model new function appears duplication functionally distinct new genes evolve continuous selection one example fitting model preexisting parental gene salmonella enterica low levels two distinct activities gene amplified high copy number amplified gene copies accumulate mutations provide enzymatic specialization different copies faster growth selection maintains initial amplification beneficial mutant alleles relaxed less improved gene copies allowing loss rapid process completed fewer generations shows efficacy iad model allows study gene evolution real time
