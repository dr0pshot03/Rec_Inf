satellite-based measurements decadal-scale temperature change tower troposphere indicated cooling relative earths surface tropics measurements need diurnal correction prevent drifts satellites measurement time causing spurious trends derived diurnal correction tropics opposite sign previously applied use correction calculation lower tropospheric temperature satellite microwave measurements find tropical warming consistent found surface satellite-derived version middie/upper tropospheric temperature
