mechanical strain induces e-cadherin-dependent yap1 beta-catenin activation drive cell cycle entry 
mechanical strain regulates development organization function multicellular tissues mechanisms linking mechanical strain cell-cell junction proteins cellular responses poorly understood showed mechanical strain applied quiescent epithelial cells induced rapid cell cycle reentry mediated independent nuclear accumulation transcriptional activity first yap1 beta-catenin inhibition yap1 beta-catenin-mediated transcription blocked cell cycle reentry progression g1 s phase respectively maintenance quiescence yap1 nuclear exclusion beta-catenin transcriptional responses mechanical strain required e-cadherin extracellular engagement thus activation yap1 beta-catenin may represent master regulator mechanical strain-induced cell proliferation cadherins provide signaling centers required cellular responses externally applied force
