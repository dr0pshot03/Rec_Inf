glutamate-receptor-mediated encoding retrieval paired-associate learning 
paired-associate learning often used examine episodic memory humans animal models include recall food-cache locations scrub jays sequential memory report model rats encode successive sample trials two paired associates flavours food spatial locations display better-than-chance recall one item cued first study pairings particular foodstuff location never repeated ensuring unique what-where attributes blocking n-methyl-d-aspartate receptors hippocampus crucial induction certain forms activity-dependent synaptic plasticity impaired memory encoding effect recall inactivating hippocampal neural activity blocking alpha-amino--hydroxy methyl--isoxazole propionic acid ampa receptors impaired encoding recall second study two paired associates trained repeatedly weeks new pairs blocking hippocampal ampa receptors affect recall thus conclude unique paired associates depend encoding retrieval within hippocampal memory space consolidation memory traces representing repeated paired associates circuits elsewhere
