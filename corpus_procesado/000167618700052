biogenic carbon cycling upper ocean: effects microbial respiration 
food-web processes important controls oceanic biogenic carbon flux ocean-atmosphere carbon dioxide exchange two key controlling parameters growth efficiencies principal trophic components rate carbon remineralization report bacterial growth efficiency inverse function temperature relationship permits bacterial respiration euphotic zone computed temperature bacterial production using temperature-growth efficiency relationship show bacterial respiration generally accounts community respiration implies larger fraction assimilated carbon respired low high latitudes greater proportion production can exported polar tropical regions bacterial production also function temperature possible compute euphotic zone heterotrophic respiration large scales using remotely sensed information
