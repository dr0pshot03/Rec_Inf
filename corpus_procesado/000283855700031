specification morphogenesis astrocytes
astrocytes abundant cell type mammalian brain interest astrocyte function increased dramatically recent years newly discovered roles synapse formation maturation efficacy plasticity however understanding astrocyte development lagged behind brain cell types know molecular mechanism astrocytes specified grow assume complex morphologies interact sculpt developing neuronal circuits recent work provided basic understanding intrinsic extrinsic mechanisms govern production astrocytes precursor cells generation astrocyte diversity moreover new studies astrocyte morphology revealed mature astrocytes extraordinarily complex interact many thousands synapses tile astrocytes occupy unique spatial domains brain major challenge field understand astrocytes talk neurons development establish appropriate astrocytic neuronal network architectures
