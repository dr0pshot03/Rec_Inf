principles connectivity among morphologically defined cell types adult neocortex
since work ramon y cajal late 19th early 20th centuries neuroscientists speculated complete understanding neuronal cell types connections key explaining complex brain functions however complete census constituent cell types wiring diagram mature neocortex remains elusive combining octuple whole-cell recordings optimized avidin-biotin-peroxidase staining technique carried morphological electrophysiological census neuronal types layers / mature neocortex mapped connectivity pairs identified neurons categorized types interneurons exhibited characteristic pattern connectivity interneuron types pyramidal cells essential connectivity structure neocortical microcircuit captured connectivity motifs
