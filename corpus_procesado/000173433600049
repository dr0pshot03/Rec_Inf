species diversity enhances ecosystem functioning interspecific facilitation
facilitation species thought key mechanism biodiversity affects rates resource use govern efficiency productivity ecosystems- however direct empirical evidence support hypothesis show increasing species diversity functional group aquatic organisms induces facilitative interactions leading non-additive changes resource consumption increased richness evenness suspension-feeding caddisfly larvae insecta trichoptera stream mesocosms found increased topographical complexity benthic habitat alters patterns near-bed flow feeding success individuals enhanced species diversity reduces current shading deceleration flow upstream downstream neighbours allowing diverse assemblages capture greater fraction suspended resources caught species monoculture fundamental nature form hydrodynamic facilitation suggests broadly applicable freshwater marine habitats addition several analogues terrestrial ecosystems fluxes energy matter can influenced biophysical complexity thus changes species diversity may alter probability positive species interactions resulting disproportionately large changes functioning ecosystems
