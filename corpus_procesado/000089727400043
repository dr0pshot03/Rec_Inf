single photons demand single molecule room temperature
generation non-classical states light fundamental scientific technological interest example `squeezed states enable measurements performed lower noise levels possible using classical light deterministic triggered single-photon sources exhibit non-classical behaviour emit high degree certainty just one photon user-specified time contrast classical source attenuated pulsed laser emits photons according poisson statistics deterministic source single photons rnd applications quantum information processing quantum cryptography certain quantum computation problems realize controllable source single photons using optical pumping single molecule solid triggered single photons produced high rate whereas probability simultaneous emission two photons nearly zero-a useful property secure quantum cryptography approach characterized simplicity room temperature operation improved performance compared triggered sources single photons
