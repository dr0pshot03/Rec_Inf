competition phylogeny determine community structure mullerian co-mimics 
recently study negative antagonistic interactions example competition predation dominated understanding community structure maintenance assembly nevertheless recent theoretical model suggests positive interactions example mutualisms may counterbalance competition facilitating long-term coexistence even among ecologically undifferentiated species mullerian mimics mutualists share costs predator education therefore ideally suited investigation positive negative interactions community dynamics sole empirical test model mullerian mimetic community supports prediction positive interactions outweigh negative effects spatial overlap without quantifying resource acquisition understanding role trophic niche partitioning facilitating evolution stability mullerian mimetic communities now critical importance yet formally investigated show resource partitioning phylogeny determine community structure outweigh positive effects mullerian mimicry species-rich group neotropical catfishes multiple independent reproductively isolated allopatric communities displaying convergently evolved colour patterns % consist species compete resources significant differences phylogenetically conserved traits snout morphology body size consistently linked trait-specific resource acquisition thus report first evidence knowledge competition trophic resources phylogeny pivotal factors stable evolution mullerian mimicry rings generally work demonstrates competition resources likely dominant role structuring communities simultaneously subject effects positive negative interactions
