microscopic view structural phase transitions induced shock waves
multimillion-atom molecular-dynamics simulations used investigate shock-induced phase transformation solid iron critical shock strength many small close-packed grains nucleate shock-compressed body-centered cubic crystal growing picosecond time scale form larger energetically favored grains split two-wave shock structure observed immediately threshold elastic precursor ahead lagging transformation wave even higher shock strengths single overdriven wave obtained dynamics orientation developing close-packed grains depend shock strength especially crystallographic shock direction orientational relations unshocked shocked regions similar found temperature-driven martensitic transformation iron alloys
