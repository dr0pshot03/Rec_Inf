net effect anthropogenic aerosols climate usually considered sum direct radiative effect anthropogenic aerosols plus indirect effect aerosols aerosol-cloud interactions however additional impact aerosols longer time scale indirect effect climate biogeochemical feedbacks largely due changes atmospheric concentration co2 aerosols can affect land ocean biogeochemical cycles physical forcing adding nutrients pollutants ecosystems net biogeochemical effect aerosols estimated equivalent radiative forcing +/ watts per square meter suggests reaching lower carbon targets will even costlier previously estimated
