spatially resolved electronic structure inside outside vortex cores high-temperature superconductor
puzzling aspects high-transition-temperature high-t-c superconductors include prevalence magnetism normal state persistence superconductivity high magnetic fields superconductivity magnetism generally thought incompatible based known conventional superconductors recent results however indicate antiferromagnetism can appear superconducting state high-t-c superconductor presence applied magnetic field magnetic fields penetrate superconductor form quantized flux lines represents vortex supercurrents superconductivity suppressed core vortex suggested antiferromagnetism might develop report results high-field nuclear-magnetic-resonance nmr imaging experiment- spatially resolve electronic structure near-optimally doped yba2cu3o7-delta inside outside vortex cores outside cores rnd strong antiferromagnetic fluctuations whereas inside detect electronic states rather different found conventional superconductors
