crystal structure tricorn protease reveals protein disassembly line
degradation cytosolic proteins carried predominantly proteasome generates peptides amino acids long products need processing recently proteolytic system identified model organism thermoplasma acidophilum performs processing hexameric core protein modular system referred tricorn protease 720k protease able assemble giant icosahedral capsid determined electron microscopy present crystal structure tricorn protease angstrom resolution structure reveals complex mosaic protein whereby five domains combine form one six subunits assemble form -symmetric core protein structure shows individual domains coordinate specific steps substrate processing including channelling substrate product catalytic site moreover structure shows accessory protein components might contribute even complex protein machinery efficiently collects tricorn-released products
