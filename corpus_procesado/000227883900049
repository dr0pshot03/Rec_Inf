extrusion cells inappropriate dpp signaling drosophila wing disc epithelia 
decapentaplegic dpp signaling molecule controls growth patterning developing drosophila wing mutant cells lacking dpp signal transduction shown activate c-jun amino-terminal kinase jnk-dependent apoptosis lost wing disc epithelium observations led hypothesis dpp promotes cell survival preventing apoptosis show absence jnk-dependent apoptosis mutant cells tacking dpp signal transduction can survive; however still lost wing disc epithelium loss correlates extensive cytoskeletal changes followed basal epithelial extrusion propose dpp promotes cell survival within disc epithelia affecting cytoskeletal organization
