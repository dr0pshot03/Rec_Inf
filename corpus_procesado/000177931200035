simultaneous micromanipulation multiple planes using self-reconstructing light beam
optical tweezers commonly used manipulating microscopic particles applications cell manipulation colloid research- manipulation micromachines studies properties light beams tweezers work transfer momentum tightly focused laser particle refracts scatters light distorts profile beam forces produced process cause particle trapped near beam focus conventional tweezers use gaussian light beams trap particles multiple locations micrometres apart axial direction beam distortion particle subsequent strong divergence focal plane bessel beams however diverge furthermore part beam obstructed distorted beam reconstructs characteristic propagation distance show reconstructive property may utilized within optical tweezers trap particles multiple spatially separated sample cells single beam owing diffractionless nature bessel beam secondary trapped particles can reside second sample cell far removed similar to3 mm first cell tweezers used simultaneous study identically prepared ensembles colloids biological matter potentially offer enhanced control lab-on-a-chip optically driven microstructures
