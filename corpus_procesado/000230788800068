optimality evolutionary tuning expression level protein
different proteins different expression levels unclear extent expression levels optimized environment evolutionary theories suggest protein expression levels maximize fitness- fitness function protein level seldom directly measured address studied lac system escherichia coli allows cell use sugar lactose growth experimentally measured growth burden due production maintenance lac proteins cost well growth advantage benefit conferred lac proteins lactose present fitness function given difference benefit cost predicts lactose environment exists optimal lac expression level maximizes growth rate performed serial dilution evolution experiments different lactose concentrations hundred generations cells evolved reach predicted optimal expression levels thus protein expression lac operon seems solution cost-benefit optimization problem can rapidly tuned evolution function optimally new environments
