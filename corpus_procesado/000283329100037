impeding xist expression active x chromosome improves mouse somatic cell nuclear transfer 
cloning mammals means somatic cell nuclear transfer scnt highly inefficient erroneous reprogramming donor genome reprogramming errors appear arise randomly nature nonrandom scnt-specific errors remains elusive found xist noncoding rna inactivates one two x chromosomes females ectopically expressed active x xa chromosome cloned mouse embryos sexes deletion xist xa showed normal global gene expression resulted eight-to ninefold increase cloning efficiency also identified xist-independent mechanism specifically down-regulated subset x-linked genes somatic-type repressive histone blocks thus identified nonrandom reprogramming errors mouse cloning can altered improve efficiency scnt methods
