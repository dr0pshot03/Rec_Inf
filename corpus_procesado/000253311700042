differential regulation dynein kinesin motor proteins tau
dynein kinesin motor proteins transport cellular cargoes toward opposite ends microtubule tracks neurons microtubules abundantly decorated microtubule associated proteins maps tau motor proteins thus encounter maps frequently along path determine effects tau dynein kinesin motility conducted single molecule studies motor proteins moving along tau decorated microtubules dynein tended reverse direction whereas kinesin tended detach patches bound tau kinesin inhibited tenth tau concentration inhibited dynein microtubule binding domain tau sufficient inhibit motor activity differential modulation dynein kinesin motility suggests maps can spatially regulate balance microtubule dependent axonal transport
