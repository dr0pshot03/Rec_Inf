experimental realization magnetic cloak 
invisibility electromagnetic fields become exciting theoretical possibility however experimental realization electromagnetic cloaks achieved starting simplified approaches instance based ray approximation canceling terms scattering fields hiding bulge plane instead object free space demonstrate directly maxwell equations specially designed cylindrical superconductor-ferromagnetic bilayer can exactly cloak uniform static magnetic fields experimentally confirmed effect actual setup
