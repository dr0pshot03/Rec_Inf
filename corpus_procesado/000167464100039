structure bacterial flagellar protofilament implications switch supercoiling 
bacterial flagellar filament helical propeller constructed protofilaments single protein flagellin filament switches left right-handed supercoiled forms bacteria switch swimming mode running tumbling supercoiling produced two different packing interactions flagellin called l r switching l r intersubunit distance similar angstrom along protofilament decreases angstrom changes number l r protofilaments govern supercoiling filament report angstrom resolution crystal structure salmonella flagellin fragment relative molecular mass crystal contains pairs antiparallel straight protofilaments r-type repeat simulated extension protofilament model identified possible switch regions responsible bi-stable mechanical switch generates angstrom difference repeat distance
