acd toxin-produced actin oligomers poison formin-controlled actin polymerization 
actin cross-linking domain acd actin-specific toxin produced several pathogens including life-threatening spp vibrio cholerae vibrio vulnificus aeromonas hydrophila actin cross-linking acd thought lead slow cytoskeleton failure owing gradual sequestration actin form nonfunctional oligomers found acd converted cytoplasmic actin highly toxic oligomers potently poisoned ability major actin assembly proteins formins sustain actin polymerization thus acd can target abundant cellular protein using actin oligomers secondary toxins efficiently subvert cellular functions actin functioning low doses
