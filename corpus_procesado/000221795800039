atmospheric new particle formation enhanced organic acids 
atmospheric aerosols often contain substantial fraction organic matter role organic compounds new nanometer-sized particle formation highly uncertain laboratory experiments show nucleation sulfuric acid considerably enhanced presence aromatic acids theoretical calculations identify formation unusually stable aromatic acid sulfuric acid complex likely leads reduced nucleation barrier results imply interaction organic sulfuric acids promotes efficient formation organic sulfate aerosols polluted atmosphere emissions burning fossil fuels strongly affect human health global climate
