modelling ribavirin improves interferon response rates hepatitis c virus infection
nearly million individuals worldwide currently infected hepatitis c virus hcv combination therapy pegylated interferon ribavirin latest treatment hcv infection elicits long-term responses % patients treated- effective alternative treatments exist non-responders consequently significant efforts continuing maximize response combination therapy however rational therapy optimization precluded poor understanding mechanisms ribavirin action hcv8 ribavirin alone induces either transient early decline decrease hcv viral load- combination interferon significantly improves long-term response rates-- present model hcv dynamics basis growing evidence- assume ribavirin decreases hcv infectivity infected individual dose-dependent manner model quantitatively predicts long-term response rates interferon monotherapy combination therapy fits observed patterns hcv rna decline patients undergoing therapy reconciles conflicting observations influence ribavirin hcv rna decline provides key insights mechanism ribavirin action hcv establishes framework rational therapy optimization
