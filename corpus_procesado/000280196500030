genetic reactivation cone photoreceptors restores visual responses retinitis pigmentosa
retinitis pigmentosa refers diverse group hereditary diseases lead incurable blindness affecting two million people worldwide common pathology rod photoreceptors die early whereas light-insensitive morphologically altered cone photoreceptors persist longer unknown cones accessible therapeutic intervention show expression archaebacterial halorhodopsin light-insensitive cones can substitute native phototransduction cascade restore light sensitivity mouse models retinitis pigmentosa resensitized photoreceptors activate retinal cone pathways drive sophisticated retinal circuit functions including directional selectivity activate cortical circuits mediate visually guided behaviors using human ex vivo retinas show halorhodopsin can reactivate light-insensitive human photoreceptors finally identified blind patients persisting light-insensitive cones potential halorhodopsin-based therapy
