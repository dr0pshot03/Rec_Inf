exponential gain saturation self-amplified spontaneous emission free-electron laser 
self-amplified spontaneous emission free-electron laser proposed generation high brightness coherent x-rays process involves passing high-energy high-charge short-pulse low-energy-spread low-emittance electron beam periodic magnetic field long series high-quality undulator magnets radiation produced grows exponentially intensity reaches saturation point report demonstration self-amplified spontaneous emission gain exponential growth saturation visible nanometers ultraviolet nanometers wavelengths good agreement theory simulation indicates scaling much shorter wavelengths may possible results confirm physics behind self-amplified spontaneous emission process forward development operational x-ray free-electron laser
