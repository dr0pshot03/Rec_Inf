monoenergetic beams relativistic electrons intense laser-plasma interactions
high-power lasers fit university-scale laboratory can now reach focused intensities w cm- high repetition rates lasers capable producing beams energetic electrons- protons gamma-rays relativistic electrons generated breaking large-amplitude relativistic plasma waves created wake laser pulse propagates plasma direct interaction laser field electrons plasma however electron beams produced previous laser plasma experiments large energy spread limiting use potential applications report high-resolution energy measurements electron beams produced intense laser plasma interactions showing particular plasma conditions possible generate beams relativistic electrons low divergence small energy spread less three per cent monoenergetic features observed electron energy spectrum plasma densities just threshold required breaking plasma wave features observed consistently electron spectrum although energy beam observed vary shot shot issue energy reproducibility can addressed possible generate ultrashort monoenergetic electron bunches tunable energy holding great promise future development table-top particle accelerators
