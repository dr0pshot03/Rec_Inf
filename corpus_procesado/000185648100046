molecular identification danger signal alerts immune system dying cells
infections microbial components provide signals alert immune system danger promote generation immunity absence signals often immune response tolerance may develop led concept immune system responds antigens perceived associated dangerous situation infection danger signals thought act stimulating dendritic cells mature can present foreign antigens stimulate t lymphocytes- dying mammalian cells also found release danger signals unknown identity- show uric acid principal endogenous danger signal released injured cells uric acid stimulates dendritic cell maturation co-injected antigen vivo significantly enhances generation responses cd8+ t cells eliminating uric acid vivo inhibits immune response antigens associated injured cells antigens presented activated dendritic cells findings provide molecular link cell injury immunity important implications vaccines autoimmunity inflammation
