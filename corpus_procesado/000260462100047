comprehensive mass-spectrometry-based proteome quantification haploid versus diploid yeast 
mass spectrometry powerful technology analysis large numbers endogenous proteins however analytical challenges associated comprehensive identification relative quantification cellular proteomes far appeared insurmountable using advances computational proteomics instrument performance sample preparation strategies compare protein levels essentially endogenous proteins haploid yeast cells diploid counterparts analysis spans four orders magnitude protein abundance discrimination membrane low level regulatory proteins stable isotope labelling amino acids cell culture silac quantification accurate across proteome demonstrated one one ratios yeast proteins key members pheromone pathway specific haploid yeast others unaltered suggesting efficient control mechanism mating response several retrotransposon associated proteins specific haploid yeast gene ontology analysis pinpointed significant change cell wall components agreement geometrical considerations: diploid cells twice volume twice surface area haploid cells transcriptome levels agreed poorly proteome changes overall however filtering low confidence microarray measurements messenger rna changes silac ratios correlated well pheromone pathway components systems wide precise quantification directly protein level opens new perspectives post genomics systems biology
