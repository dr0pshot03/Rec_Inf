strong highly-tilted interstellar magnetic field near solar system 
magnetic fields play important sometimes dominant role evolution gas clouds galaxy strength orientation field interstellar medium near heliosphere poorly constrained previous estimates field strength range - mu g field thought parallel galactic plane inclined degrees ref degrees ref plane estimates relied either indirect observational inferences modelling interstellar neutral hydrogen taken account report measurements deflection solar wind plasma flows heliosheath determine magnetic field strength orientation interstellar medium find field strength local interstellar medium - mu g field tilted similar degrees interstellar medium flow direction resulting peculiar motion sun galaxy angle degrees galactic plane conclude interstellar medium field turbulent distortion solar vicinity
