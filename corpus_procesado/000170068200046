mealybug beta-proteobacterial endosymbionts contain gamma-proteobacterial symbionts
insects cultivated intimate relationships mutualistic bacteria since early evolutionary history ancient `primary endosymbionts live within cytoplasm large polyploid host cells specialized organ bacteriome within large ovoid bacteriomes mealybugs pseudococcidae package intracellular endosymbionts `mucus-filled spheres surround host cell nucleus occupy cytoplasm genesis symbiotic spheres determined structurally unlike eukaryotic cell vesicles recent molecular phylogenetic fluorescent situ hybridization fish studies suggested two unrelated bacterial species may share individual host cells bacteria within spheres comprise two species show mealybug host cells indeed harbour beta gamma subdivision proteobacteria co-inhabitants spheres rather show symbiotic spheres beta proteobacterial cells thus gamma proteobacteria live symbiotically inside beta proteobacteria first report knowledge intracellular symbiosis involving two species bacteria
