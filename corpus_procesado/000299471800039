purkinje neuron synchrony elicits time-locked spiking cerebellar nuclei
unusual feature cerebellar cortex output neurons purkinje cells release gaba gamma-aminobutyric acid high intrinsic firing rates hz extensive convergence predict target neurons cerebellar nuclei largely inhibited unless purkinje cells pause spiking yet purkinje nuclear neuron firing rates always vary inversely one indication synapses transmit information populations purkinje neurons synchronize spikes cerebellar behaviours- nuclear neurons respond purkinje synchrony may encode signals subsets inhibitory inputs- show weanling adult mice nuclear neurons transmit timing synchronous purkinje afferent spikes owing modest purkinje-to-nuclear convergence ratios similar : fast inhibitory postsynaptic current kinetics taudecay ms high intrinsic firing rates similar hz vitro dynamically clamped asynchronous inhibitory postsynaptic potentials mimicking purkinje afferents suppress nuclear cell spiking whereas synchronous inhibitory postsynaptic potentials entrain nuclear cell spiking partial synchrony nuclear neurons time-lock spikes synchronous subpopulation inputs even afferents synchronize vivo nuclear neurons reliably phase-lock regular trains molecular layer stimulation thus cerebellar nuclear neurons can preferentially relay spike timing synchronized purkinje cells downstream premotor areas
