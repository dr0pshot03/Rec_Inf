transcription factor iib acetylates regulate transcription
acetylation well-known regulatory post-translational modification biological function acetylation regulating basal transcription factors reported show general transcription factor tfiib required initiation eukaryotic polymerase ii transcription acetylated tfiib also autoacetyltransferase although shares sequence homology known acetyltransferases absence enzymes binds acetyl-coenzyme acetyl-coa catalyses transfer acetyl group onto specific lysine residue k238 recombinant cellular tfiib can autoacetylate markedly stabilizing interaction tfiib transcription factor tfiif activating transcription vitro cells k238a mutant autoacetylated show activation transcription findings suggest regulatory pathway controlling acetylation tfiib link acetyl-coa basal gene transcription
