crispr/cas immune system bacteria archaea
microbes rely diverse defense mechanisms allow withstand viral predation exposure invading nucleic acid many bacteria archaea clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats crispr form peculiar genetic loci provide acquired immunity viruses plasmids targeting nucleic acid sequence-specific manner hypervariable loci take genetic material invasive elements build inheritable dna-encoded immunity time conversely viruses devised mutational escape strategies allow circumvent crispr/cas system albeit cost crispr features may exploited typing purposes epidemiological studies host-virus ecological surveys building specific immunity undesirable genetic elements enhancing viral resistance domesticated microbes
