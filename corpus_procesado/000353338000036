mutagenic chain reaction: method converting heterozygous homozygous mutations
organism single recessive loss-of-function allele will typically wild-type phenotype whereas individuals homozygous two copies allele will display mutant phenotype developed method called mutagenic chain reaction mcr based crispr/cas9 genome-editing system generating autocatalytic mutations produce homozygous loss-of-function mutations drosophila found mcr mutations efficiently spread chromosome origin homologous chromosome thereby converting heterozygous mutations homozygosity vast majority somatic germline cells mcr technology broad applications diverse organisms
