bacterial effector acts plant transcription factor induces cell size regulator
pathogenicity many gram-negative bacteria relies injection effector proteins type iii secretion eukaryotic cells modulate host signaling pathways pathogens benefit one effector protein injected xanthomonas plants avrbs3 localizes plant cell nucleus causes hypertrophy plant mesophyll cells show avrbs3 induces expression master regulator cell size upa20 encodes transcription factor containing basic helix-loop-helix domain avrbs3 binds conserved element upa20 promoter via central repeat region induces gene expression activation domain thus avrbs3 likely members family provoke developmental reprogramming host cells mimicking eukaryotic transcription factors
