room-temperature ferromagnetic nanotubes controlled electron hole doping
nanotubes nanowires elemental carbon silicon multi-element- compositions compound semiconductors oxides exhibiting electronic properties ranging metallic semiconducting extensively investigated use device structures designed control electron charge- however another important degree freedom-electron spin control underlies operation spintronic devices-has much less explored probably due relative paucity nanometre-scale ferromagnetic building blocks electron spins naturally aligned spin-polarized electrons can injected describe nanotubes vanadium oxide vox formed controllable self-assembly ferromagnetic room temperature as-formed nanotubes transformed spin-frustrated semiconductors ferromagnets doping either electrons holes potentially offering route spin control nanotube-based heterostructures
