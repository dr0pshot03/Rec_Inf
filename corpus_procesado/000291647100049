converting nonsense codons sense codons targeted pseudouridylation 
three translation termination codons nonsense codons contain uridine residue first position codon1- demonstrate pseudouridylation conversion uridine pseudouridine psi ref nonsense codons suppresses translation termination vitro vivo vivo targeting nonsense codons accomplished expression h/aca rna capable directing isomerization uridine psi within nonsense codon thus targeted pseudouridylation represents novel approach promoting nonsense suppression vivo remarkably also show pseudouridylated nonsense codons code amino acids similar properties specifically psi aa psi ag code serine threonine whereas psi ga codes tyrosine phenylalanine thus suggesting new mode decoding results also suggest rna modification naturally occurring mechanism may offer new way expand genetic code
