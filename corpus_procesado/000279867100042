hot compact dust disk around massive young stellar object
circumstellar disks essential ingredient formation low-mass stars unclear however whether accretion-disk paradigm can also account formation stars massive solar masses strong radiation pressure might halt mass infall massive stars may form stellar merging although recent theoretical investigations suggest radiative-pressure limit may overcome considering complex non-spherical infall geometries clear observational evidence detection compact dusty disks around massive young stellar objects needed identify unambiguously formation mode massive stars report near-infrared interferometric observations spatially resolve astronomical-unit-scale distribution hot material around high-mass similar solar masses young stellar object image shows elongated structure size similar x astronomical units consistent disk seen inclination angle similar degrees using geometric detailed physical models found radial temperature gradient disk dust-free region less astronomical units star qualitatively quantitatively similar disks observed low-mass star formation perpendicular disk plane observed molecular outflow two bow shocks indicating bipolar outflow emanates inner regions system
