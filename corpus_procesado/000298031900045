image-based genome-wide sirna screen identifies selective autophagy factors 
selective autophagy involves recognition targeting specific cargo damaged organelles misfolded proteins invading pathogens lysosomal destruction1- yeast genetic screens identified proteins required different forms selective autophagy including cytoplasm-to-vacuole targeting pexophagy mitophagy mammalian genetic screens identified proteins required autophagy regulation5 however systematic approaches identify molecular determinants selective autophagy mammalian cells identify mammalian genes required selective autophagy performed high-content image-based genome-wide small interfering rna screen detect genes required colocalization sindbis virus capsid protein autophagolysosomes identified candidate genes required viral autophagy enriched cellular pathways related messenger rna processing interferon signalling vesicle trafficking cytoskeletal motor function metabolism ninety-six genes also required parkin-mediated mitophagy indicating common molecular determinants may involved autophagic targeting viral nucleocapsids autophagic targeting damaged mitochondria murine embryonic fibroblasts lacking one gene products c2-domain containing protein smurf1 deficient autophagosomal targeting sindbis herpes simplex viruses clearance damaged mitochondria moreover smurf1-deficient mice accumulate damaged mitochondria heart brain liver thus study identifies candidate determinants selective autophagy defines smurf1 newly recognized mediator viral autophagy mitophagy
