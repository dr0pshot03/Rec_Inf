single-base pair unwinding asynchronous rna release hepatitis c virus ns3 helicase
nonhexameric helicases use adenosine triphosphate atp unzip base pairs double-stranded nucleic acids dsnas studies suggested helicases unzip dsnas single-base pair increments consuming one atp molecule per base pair direct evidence mechanism lacking used optical tweezers follow unwinding double-stranded rna hepatitis c virus ns3 helicase single-base pair steps ns3 observed along nascent nucleotide release asynchronous base pair opening asynchronous release nascent nucleotides rationalizes various observations dsna unwinding may used coordinate translocation speed ns3 along rna viral replication
