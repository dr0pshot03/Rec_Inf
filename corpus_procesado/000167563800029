colloidal nanocrystal shape size control: case cobalt 
show relatively simple approach controlling colloidal synthesis anisotropic cadmium selenide semiconductor nanorods can extended size-controlled preparation magnetic cobalt nanorods well spherically shaped nanocrystals approach helps define minimum feature set needed separately control sizes shapes nanocrystals resulting cobalt nanocrystals produce interesting two three-dimensional superstructures including ribbons nanorods
