fruitless specifies sexually dimorphic neural circuitry drosophila brain 
drosophila fruitless fru gene product fru postulated neural sex determination factor directs development central nervous system cns thereby producing male-typical courtship behaviour inducing male-specific muscle1- male-specific fru protein expressed small groups neurons scattered throughout cns male female drosophila47 collectively observations suggest fru masculinizes certain neurons thereby establishing neural substrates male-typical behaviour however specific differences neurons resulting presence absence fru unknown previous studies suggested fru might result sexual differences cns functional level overt sexual dimorphism cns structure discernible8- identify subset fru-expressing interneurons brain show marked sexual dimorphism number projection pattern also demonstrate fru supports development neurons male-specific dendritic fields programmed die female development result absence fru thus fru expression can produce male-specific neural circuit probably used heterosexual courtship preventing cell death identifiable neurons
