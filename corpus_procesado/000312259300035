formation widest binary stars dynamical unfolding triple systems
formation wide binary systems- centauri system proxima also known centauri c separated centauri close binarya/b astronomical units au distance earth sun challenges current theories star formation separation can exceed typical size collapsing cloud core various hypotheses proposed overcome problem including suggestion ultrawide binaries result dissolution star cluster-when cluster star gravitationally captures another distant cluster star- recent observations shown wide binaries frequently members triple systems close binaries often distant third companion- report n-body simulations dynamical evolution newborn triple systems still embedded nascent cloud cores match observations wide systems- find although triple systems born compact-and therefore initially protected disruption passing stars-they can develop extreme hierarchical architectures timescales millions years one component dynamically scattered distant orbit energy ejection comes shrinking orbits two stars often making look distance like single star loosely bound triple systems will therefore appear wide binaries
