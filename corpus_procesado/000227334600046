anaerobic mitochondrion produces hydrogen 
hydrogenosomes organelles produce atp hydrogen found various unrelated eukaryotes anaerobic flagellates chytridiomycete fungi ciliates although organelles generate hydrogen hydrogenosomes organisms structurally metabolically quite different just like mitochondria large differences also exist differences led continuing debate evolutionary origin hydrogenosomes show hydrogenosomes anaerobic ciliate nyctotherus ovalis thrives hindgut cockroaches retained rudimentary genome encoding components mitochondrial electron transport chain phylogenetic analyses reveal proteins cluster homologues aerobic ciliates addition several nucleus-encoded components mitochondrial proteome pyruvate dehydrogenase complex ii identified n ovalis hydrogenosome sensitive inhibitors mitochondrial complex produces succinate major metabolic end product biochemical traits typical anaerobic mitochondria production hydrogen together presence genome encoding respiratory chain components biochemical features characteristic anaerobic mitochondria identify n ovalis organelle missing link mitochondria hydrogenosomes
