caenorhabditis elegans larvae hatch egg case absence food development arrested l1 arrest show increased stress resistance food becomes available study nutritional control larval development analyzed growth gene expression profiles l1 arrest recovery larvae fed responded relatively slowly starvation compared rapid response arrested larvae feeding chromatin immunoprecipitation rna polymerase ii pol ii followed deep sequencing showed l1 arrest pol ii continued transcribing starvation-response genes enzyme accumulated promoters growth development genes response feeding promoter accumulation decreased elongation messenger rna levels increased therefore accumulation pol ii promoters anticipates nutritionally controlled gene expression c elegans development
