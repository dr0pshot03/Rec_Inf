divergent regulation dihydrofolate reductase malaria parasite human host 
half century successful antifolate therapy plasmodium falciparum malaria attributed host-parasite differences drug binding dihydrofolate reductase-thymidylate synthase dhfr-ts selectivity may also arise previously unappreciated differences regulation drug target dhfr-ts plasmodium binds cognate messenger rna mrna inhibits translation however unlike translational regulation dhfr ts humans dhfr-ts mrna binding coupled enzyme active sites thus antifolate treatment relieve translational inhibition parasites replenish dead enzyme
