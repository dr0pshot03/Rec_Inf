chemistry deformation: solutes soften pure metals 
solutes added strengthen elemental metals generating usable materials millennia 1960s solutes found also soften metals despite empirical correlation electron number solute change strength material added mechanism responsible softening poorly understood using state-of-the-art quantum-mechanical methods studied direct interaction transition-metal solutes dislocations molybdenum interaction increases dramatically increasing electron number strongly influences mechanisms responsible plasticity materials quantitative model explains solution softening metals using changes energy stress scales plasticity solutes
