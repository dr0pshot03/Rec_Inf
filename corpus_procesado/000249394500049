spatial vegetation patterns imminent desertification mediterranean arid ecosystems 
humans climate affect ecosystems services may involve continuous discontinuous transitions one stable state another discontinuous transitions abrupt irreversible among catastrophic changes ecosystems identified terrestrial ecosystems hypothesized vegetation patchiness used signature imminent transitions analyse vegetation patchiness changes arid ecosystems different grazing pressures using field data modelling approach modelling approach extrapolated analysis even higher grazing pressures investigate vegetation patchiness desertification imminent three arid mediterranean ecosystems spain greece morocco found patch-size distribution vegetation follows power law using stochastic cellular automaton model show local positive interactions among plants can explain power-law distributions furthermore increasing grazing pressure field data revealed consistent deviations power laws increased grazing pressure leads similar deviations model grazing increased model found deviations always occurred close transition desert independent type transition regardless vegetation cover therefore propose patch-size distributions may warning signal onset desertification
