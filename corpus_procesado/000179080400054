neurotrophin receptor p75ntr positive modulator myelination
schwann cells developing regenerating peripheral nerves express elevated levels neurotrophin receptor p75ntr neurotrophins key mediators peripheral nervous system myelination results show myelin formation inhibited absence functional p75ntr enhanced blocking trkc activity moreover enhancement myelin formation endogenous brain-derived neurotrophic factor mediated p75ntr receptor whereas trkc receptors responsible neurotrophin inhibition thus p75ntr trkc receptors opposite effects myelination
