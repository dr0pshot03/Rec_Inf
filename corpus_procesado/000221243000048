glyr alpha : essential target spinal pge-mediated inflammatory pain sensitization
prostaglandin e pge crucial mediator inflammatory pain sensitization demonstrate inhibition specific glycine receptor subtype glyr alpha3 pge-induced receptor phosphorylation underlies central inflammatory pain sensitization show glyr alpha3 distinctly expressed superficial layers spinal cord dorsal horn mice deficient glyr alpha3 lack inhibition glycinergic neurotransmission pge seen wildtype mice also show reduction pain sensitization induced spinal pge injection peripheral inflammation thus glyr alpha3 may provide previously unrecognized molecular target pain therapy
