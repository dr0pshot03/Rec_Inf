metamorphic devolatilization subducted marine sediments transport volatiles earths mantle 
volatiles notably co2 recycled back earths interior subduction zones amount co2 emitted arc volcanism appears less subducted implies significant amount co2 either released reaching depth arc magmas generated subducted deeper depths high-pressure experimental studies- addressed problem therefore metamorphic decarbonation subduction zones remains largely unquantified despite importance arc magmatism palaeoatmospheric co2 concentrations global carbon cycle present computed phase equilibria quantify evolution co2 h2o subduction-zone metamorphism carbonate-bearing marine sediments considered major source co2 released arc volcanoes analysis indicates siliceous limestones undergo negligible devolatilization subduction-zone conditions along high-temperature geotherms clay-rich marls completely devolatilize reaching depths arc magmatism generated along low-temperature geotherms undergo virtually devolatilization km depth little devolatilization occurs carbonate-bearing marine sediments infiltration h2o-rich fluids therefore seems essential promote subarc decarbonation marine sediments absence infiltration volatiles retained within marine sediments may explain apparent discrepancy subducted volcanic volatile fluxes represent mechanism return carbon earths mantle
