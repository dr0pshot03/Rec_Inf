interchromosomal communication coordinates intrinsically stochastic expression alleles 
sensory systems use stochastic mechanisms diversify neuronal subtypes drosophila eye stochastic expression pas-bhlh transcription factor spineless ss determines random binary subtype choice r7 photoreceptors show stochastic cell-autonomous decision express ss made intrinsically ss locus stochastic expression ss allele determined combinatorial inputs one enhancer two silencers acting long range however two ss alleles also average frequency expression up-regulatory down-regulatory interallelic cross-talk inter-or intrachromosomal long-range regulation require endogenous ss chromosomal positioning pairing therefore although individual ss alleles make independent stochastic choices interchromosomal communication coordinates expression state alleles ensuring expressed random subset r7s
