rae1 h60 ligands nkg2d receptor stimulate tumour immunity
natural killer nk cells attack many tumour cell lines thought critical role anti-tumour immunity- however interaction nk cells tumour targets poorly understood stimulatory lectin-like nkg2d receptor- expressed nk cells activated cd8+ t cells activated macrophages mice several distinct cell-surface ligands related class major histocompatibility complex molecules identified- expressed high levels tumour cells normal cells adults however direct evidence links expression induced self ligands tumour cell rejection demonstrate ectopic expression murine nkg2d ligands rae1 beta h60 several tumour cell lines results potent rejection tumour cells syngeneic mice rejection mediated nk cells and/or cd8+ t cells ligand-expressing tumour cells induce potent priming cytotoxic t cells sensitization nk cells vivo mice exposed live irradiated tumour cells expressing rae1 beta h60 specifically immune subsequent challenge tumour cells lack nkg2d ligands suggesting application ligands design tumour vaccines
