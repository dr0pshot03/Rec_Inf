messenger rna targeting rice seed storage proteins specific er subdomains
rice seeds rich reserve starch protein major food source many countries unlike seeds plants typically accumulate one major type storage protein rice seeds use two major classes prolamines globulin-like glutelins storage proteins synthesized endoplasmic reticulum er translocated er lumen sorted separate intracellular compartments prolamines retained er lumen protein bodies whereas glutelins transported stored protein storage vacuoles mechanisms responsible retention prolamines within er lumen assembly intracisternal inclusion granules unknown involvement rna localization suggested show storage protein rnas localized distinct er membranes prolamine rnas targeted prolamine protein bodies mechanism based rna signals process also requires translation initiation codon results indicate er may composed subdomains specialize synthesis proteins directed different compartments plant endomembrane system
