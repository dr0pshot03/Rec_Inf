compensated deleterious mutations insect genomes
relatively little known importance amino acid interactions protein phenotypic evolution examine whether mutations pathogenic drosophila melanogaster become fixed via epistasis dipteran genomes overall divergence pathogenic amino acid sites reduced however similar to10% substitutions sites carry exact pathogenic amino acid found d melanogaster mutants hence compensatory mutations must evolved surprisingly fraction % affected phylogenetic distance results support selection-driven process allows compensated amino acid substitutions become rapidly fixed taxa large populations
