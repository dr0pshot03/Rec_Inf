asynchronous diversification specialized plant-pollinator mutualism 
flowering plants establish mutualistic associations insect pollinators facilitate sexual reproduction however evolutionary processes gave rise associations remain poorly understood reconstructed times divergence diversification patterns interaction networks diverse group specialized orchids bee pollinators contrast scenario coevolution race formation show fragrance-producing orchids originated least three times independently fragrance-collecting bee mutualists whereas orchid diversification apparently tracked diversification orchids bee pollinators bees appear depended diverse chemical environment neotropical forests corroborated apparent asymmetrical dependency simulating co-extinction cascades real interaction networks lacked reciprocal specialization results suggest diversification insect-pollinated angiosperms may facilitated exploitation preexisting sensory biases insect pollinators
