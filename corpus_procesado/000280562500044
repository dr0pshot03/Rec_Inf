microbial metalloproteomes largely uncharacterized
metal ion cofactors afford proteins virtually unlimited catalytic potential enable electron transfer reactions great impact protein stability consequently metalloproteins key roles biological processes including respiration iron copper photosynthesis manganese drug metabolism iron yet predicting genome sequence numbers types metal organism assimilates environment uses metalloproteome currently impossible metal coordination sites diverse poorly recognized- present robust metal-based approach determine metals organism assimilates identify metalloproteins genome-wide scale shifts focus classical protein-based purification metal-based identification purification liquid chromatography high-throughput tandem mass spectrometry ht-ms/ms inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp-ms characterize cytoplasmic metalloproteins exemplary microorganism pyrococcus furiosus metal peaks chromatography fractions match predicted metalloprotein unassigned peaks included metals known used cobalt iron nickel tungsten zinc peaks plus metals organism thought assimilate lead manganese molybdenum uranium vanadium peaks purification eight unexpected metal peaks yielded four novel nickel molybdenum-containing proteins whereas four purified proteins contained sub-stoichiometric amounts misincorporated lead uranium analyses two additional microorganisms escherichia coli sulfolobus solfataricus revealed species-specific assimilation yet unexpected metals metalloproteomes therefore much extensive diverse previously recognized promise provide key insights cell biology microbial growth toxicity mechanisms
