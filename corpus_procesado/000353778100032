proteomics reveals dynamic assembly repair complexes bypass dna cross-links
dna interstrand cross-links icls block replication fork progression inhibiting dna strand separation repair icls requires sequential incisions translesion dna synthesis homologous recombination full set factors involved transactions remains unknown devised technique called chromatin mass spectrometry chromass study protein recruitment dynamics perturbed dna replication xenopus egg extracts using chromass systematically monitored protein assembly disassembly icl-containing chromatin among numerous prospective dna repair factors identified slf1 slf2 form complex rad18 together define pathway suppresses genome instability recruiting smc5/ cohesion complex dna lesions study provides global analysis entire dna repair pathway reveals mechanism smc5/ relocalization damaged dna vertebrate cells
