receptors dopamine somatostatin: formation hetero-oligomers enhanced functional activity 
somatostatin dopamine two major neurotransmitter systems share number structural functional characteristics somatostatin receptors dopamine receptors colocalized neuronal subgroups somatostatin involved modulating dopamine-mediated control motor activity however molecular basis interaction two systems unclear show dopamine receptor d2r somatostatin receptor sstr5 interact physically hetero-oligomerization create novel receptor enhanced functional activity results provide evidence receptors different g protein heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide binding protein-coupled receptor families interact oligomerization direct intramembrane association defines new level molecular crosstalk related g protein-coupled receptor subfamilies
