widespread genetic switches toxicity resistance proteins fluoride 
riboswitches metabolite-binding rna structures located bacterial messenger rnas control gene expression discovered riboswitch class many bacterial archaeal species whose members selectively triggered fluoride reject small anions including chloride fluoride riboswitches activate expression genes encode putative fluoride transporters enzymes known inhibited fluoride additional proteins unknown function findings indicate organisms naturally exposed toxic levels fluoride many species use fluoride-sensing rnas control expression proteins alleviate deleterious effects anion
