pre-unfolding resonant oscillations single green fluorescent protein molecules 
fluorescence spectroscopy green fluorescent protein mutant single-molecule resolution revealed remarkable oscillatory behavior can also driven applied fields show immediately unfolding several periodic oscillations among chemical substates protein chromophore occur also show applied alternating electric acoustic fields tuned protein characteristic frequencies give rise strong resonance effects
