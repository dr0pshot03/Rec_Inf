self-propagating molecular-level polymorphism alzheimers beta-amyloid fibrils 
amyloid fibrils commonly exhibit multiple distinct morphologies electron microscope atomic force microscope images often within single image field using electron microscopy solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance measurements fibrils formed -residue beta-amyloid peptide alzheimers disease abeta1- show different fibril morphologies different underlying molecular structures predominant structure can controlled subtle variations fibril growth conditions morphology molecular structure self-propagating fibrils grow preformed seeds different abeta1- fibril morphologies also significantly different toxicities neuronal cell cultures results implications mechanism amyloid formation phenomenon strains prion diseases role amyloid fibrils amyloid diseases development amyloid-based nanomaterials
