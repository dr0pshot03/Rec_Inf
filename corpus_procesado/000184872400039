tracking fact rna polymerase ii elongation complex chromatin vivo 
rna polymerase ii pol ii transcription nucleosomes facilitated vitro protein complex fact facilitates chromatin transcription show fact associated actively transcribed pol ii genes drosophila polytene chromosomes fact displays kinetics recruitment chromosome tracking vivo similar pol ii elongation factors spt5 spt6 interestingly fact colocalize pol iii-transcribed genes known undergo nucleosome transfer rather disassembly vitro observations consistent fact restricted transcription involves nucleosome disassembly mechanisms
