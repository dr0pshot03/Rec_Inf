changes phase annual cycle surface temperature 
annual cycle earths surface temperature extremely large comparable magnitude glacial interglacial cycles planet trends phase amplitude annual cycle observed causes significance changes remain poorly understood part lack understanding natural variability show phase annual cycle surface temperature extratropical land shifted towards earlier seasons days ; change highly anomalous respect earlier variations interpret indicative natural range significant changes amplitude annual cycle also observed shifts annual cycles appear related part changes northern annular mode climate variability although land phase shift significantly larger predicted trends northern annular mode alone climate models presented intergovernmental panel climate change reproduce observed decrease amplitude none reproduce shift towards earlier seasons
