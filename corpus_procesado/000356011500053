dispersal alien species redefines biogeography anthropocene
argued globalization human-mediated dispersal species breaks biogeographic boundaries yet empirical tests still missing used data native alien ranges terrestrial gastropods analyze dissimilarities species composition among globally distributed regions found native ranges confirm traditional biogeographic realms reflecting natural dispersal limitations however distributions gastropods human transport primarily explained prevailing climate smaller extent distance trade relationships findings show human-mediated dispersal causing breakdown biogeographic barriers climate extent socioeconomic relationships will define biogeography era global change
