current-induced domain-wall switching ferromagnetic semiconductor structure
magnetic information storage relies external magnetic fields encode logical bits magnetization reversal magnetic fields needed operate ultradense storage devices high generate magnetization reversal electrical currents attracting much interest promising alternative encoding method indeed spin-polarized currents can reverse magnetization direction nanometre sized metallic structures torque- however high current densities - cm- present required exceed threshold values tolerated metal interconnects integrated circuits encoding magnetic information metallic systems also achieved manipulating domain walls boundary regions different magnetization directions- approach requires high current densities cm- demonstrate ferromagnetic semiconductor structure magnetization reversal domain-wall switching can induced absence magnetic field using current pulses densities cm- slow switching speed low ferromagnetic transition temperature current system impractical provided problems can addressed magnetic reversal electric pulses reduced current densities provide route magnetic information storage applications
