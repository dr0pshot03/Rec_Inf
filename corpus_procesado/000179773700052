small nuclear ribonucleoprotein remodeling catalytic activation spliceosome 
major structural changes occur spliceosome activation just catalyzing splicing pre-messenger rnas pre-mrnas whereas changes small nuclear rna snrna conformation well documented little known remodeling small nuclear ribonucleoprotein snrnp structures spliceosome activation human 45s activated spliceosomes previously unknown 35s u5 snrnp isolated immunoaffinity selection characterized mass spectrometry comparison protein components snrnp spliceosomal complexes revealed major change protein composition spliceosome activation data also suggest u5 snrnp dramatically remodeled stage prp19 complex factors tightly associating possibly exchange u5 proteins suggest catalysis remodeled u5 eventually released postsplicing complex 35s snrnp particle
