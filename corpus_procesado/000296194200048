structural basis bifunctionality fructose--bisphosphate aldolase/phosphatase
enzymes catalyse specific reactions essential maintaining life although referred bifunctional consist either two distinct catalytic domains single domain displays promiscuous substrate specificity thus one enzyme active site generally responsible one biochemical reaction contrast conventional concept archaeal fructose--bisphosphate fbp aldolase/phosphatase fbpa/p consists single catalytic domain catalyses two chemically distinct reactions gluconeogenesis: reversible aldol condensation dihydroxyacetone phosphate dhap glyceraldehyde--phosphate ga3p fbp dephosphorylation fbp fructose--phosphate f6p thus fbpa/p fundamentally different ordinary enzymes whose active sites responsible specific reaction however molecular mechanism fbpa/p achieves unusual bifunctionality remains unknown report crystal structure fbpa/p -angstrom resolution aldolase form critical lysine residue forms schiff base dhap structural comparison aldolase form previously determined phosphatase form revealed dramatic conformational change active site demonstrating fbpa/p metamorphoses active-site architecture exhibit dual activities thus findings expand conventional concept one enzyme catalyses one biochemical reaction
