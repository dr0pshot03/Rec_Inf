storage spatial information maintenance mechanism ltp
analogous learning memory storage long-term potentiation ltp divided induction maintenance phases testing hypothesis mechanism ltp maintenance stores information requires reversing mechanism vivo finding whether long-term stored information lost previously possible recently however persistent phosphorylation atypical protein kinase c isoform protein kinase mzeta pkm zeta found maintain late ltp hippocampal slices show cell-permeable pkm zeta inhibitor injected rat hippocampus reverses ltp maintenance vivo produces persistent loss day-old spatial information thus mechanism maintaining ltp sustains spatial memory
