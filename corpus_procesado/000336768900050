oncogene-like induction cellular invasion centrosome amplification 
centrosome amplification long recognized feature human tumours however role tumorigenesis remains unclear centrosome amplification poorly tolerated non-transformed cells absence selection extra centrosomes spontaneously lost thus high frequency centrosome amplification particularly aggressive tumours raises possibility extra centrosomes contexts confer advantageous characteristics promote tumour progression using three-dimensional model system approaches culture human mammary epithelial cells find centrosome amplification triggers cell invasion invasive behaviour similar induced overexpression breast cancer oncogene erbb2 ref indeed enhances invasiveness triggered erbb2 data indicate increased centrosomal microtubule nucleation centrosome amplification increases rac1 activity disrupts normal cell-cell adhesion promotes invasion findings demonstrate centrosome amplification structural alteration cytoskeleton can promote features malignant transformation
