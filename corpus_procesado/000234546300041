cytokinin signaling inhibitor ahp6 regulate cell fate vascular development 
cell lineages form transporting tissues xylem phloem intervening pluripotent procambial tissue originate stem cells near root tip demonstrate arabidopsis cytokinin phytohormones negatively regulate protoxylem specification ahp6 inhibitory pseudophosphotransfer protein counteracts cytokinin signaling allowing protoxylem formation conversely cytokinin signaling negatively regulates spatial domain ahp6 expression thus controlling identity cell lineages reciprocal interaction cytokinin signaling spatially specific modulator regulates proliferation differentiation cell lineages vascular development demonstrating previously unrecognized regulatory circuit underlying meristem organization
