magmatic dike resonances inferred very-long-period seismic signals
very-long-period vlp signals showing simple decaying harmonic oscillations periods near seconds lasting seconds observed association earthquake swarm occurred beneath hachijo island japan results source-mechanism analysis waveform simulation based fluid-filled crack model consistently point resonance dike filled basaltic magma source vlp signals thus vlp signals can used probe state fluid dynamic processes within volcanic system
