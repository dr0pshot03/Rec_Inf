functional specialization rhesus monkey auditory cortex 
neurons lateral belt areas rhesus monkey auditory cortex prefer complex sounds pure tones functional specializations multiple maps superior temporal region determined tested specificity neurons lateral belt species-specific communication calls presented different azimuth positions found neurons anterior belt selective type call whereas neurons caudal belt consistently show greatest spatial selectivity results suggest cortical processing auditory spatial pattern information performed specialized streams rather one homogeneously distributed system
