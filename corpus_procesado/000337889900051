global epistasis makes adaptation predictable despite sequence-level stochasticity
epistatic interactions mutations can make evolutionary trajectories contingent chance occurrence initial mutations used experimental evolution saccharomyces cerevisiae quantify contingency finding differences adaptability among closely related genotypes despite differences sequencing evolved clones showed initial genotype constrain future mutational trajectories instead reconstructed combinations mutations revealed pattern diminishing-returns epistasis: beneficial mutations consistently smaller effects fitter backgrounds taken together results show beneficial mutations affecting variety biological processes globally coupled interact strongly combined effect fitness consequence fitness evolution follows predictable trajectory even though sequence-level adaptation stochastic
