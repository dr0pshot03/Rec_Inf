chromosome nondisjunction yields tetraploid rather aneuploid cells human cell lines 
although mutations cell cycle regulators spindle proteins can perturb chromosome segregation1- causes consequences spontaneous mitotic chromosome nondisjunction human cells well understood assumed nondisjunction chromosome mitosis will yield two aneuploid daughter cells show chromosome nondisjunction tightly coupled regulation cytokinesis human cell lines nondisjunction results formation tetraploid rather aneuploid cells observed spontaneously arising binucleated cells exhibited chromosome mis-segregation rates -fold higher overall mitotic population long-term imaging experiments indicated binucleated cells arose bipolar mitosis followed regression cleavage furrow hours later nondisjunction occurred high frequency cells became binucleated furrow regression cells completed cytokinesis form two mononucleated cells findings indicate nondisjunction directly yield aneuploid cells rather tetraploid cells may subsequently become aneuploid division coupling spontaneous segregation errors furrow regression provides potential explanation prevalence hyperdiploid chromosome number centrosome amplification observed many cancers89
