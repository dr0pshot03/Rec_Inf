control mechanism circadian clock timing cell division vivo
cell division many mammalian tissues associated specific times day just circadian clock controls timing clear show regenerating liver mice circadian clock controls expression cell cycle-related genes turn modulate expression active cyclin b1-cdc2 kinase key regulator mitosis among genes expression wee1 directly regulated molecular components circadian clockwork contrast circadian clockwork oscillated independently cell cycle single cells thus intracellular circadian clockwork can control cell-division cycle directly unidirectionally proliferating cells
