superconductivity alkali-metal-doped picene 
efforts identify develop new superconducting materials continue apace motivated fundamental science prospects application example several new superconducting material systems developed recent past including calcium-intercalated graphite compounds boron-doped diamond and-most prominently-iron arsenides lao-xfxfeas ref case organic superconductors however new material system high superconducting transition temperature tc discovered past decade report intercalating alkali metal picene wide-bandgap semiconducting solid hydrocarbon produces metallic behaviour superconductivity solid potassium-intercalated picene kxpicene shows tc values 7k k depending metal content drop magnetization kxpicene solids transition temperature sharp < k similar behaviour ca-intercalated graphite tc 18k comparable k-intercalated c ref discovery superconductivity kxpicene shows organic hydrocarbons promising candidates improved tc values
