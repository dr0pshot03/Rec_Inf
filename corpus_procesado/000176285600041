hidden orbital order heavy fermion metal uru2si2
matter cooled high temperatures collective instabilities develop among constituent particles lead new kinds order anomaly specific heat classic signature phenomenon usually associated order easily identified sometimes nature remains elusive heavy fermion metal uru2si2 one example order responsible sharp specific heat anomaly t k remained unidentified despite seventeen years effort uru2si2 coexistence large electron-electron repulsion antiferromagnetic fluctuations leads almost incompressible heavy electron fluid anisotropically paired quasiparticle states energetically favoured develop proposal nature hidden order uru2si2 show incommensurate orbital antiferromagnetism associated circulating currents uranium ions can account local fields entropy loss observed k transition make detailed predictions outcome neutron scattering measurements based proposal can tested experimentally
