single beta-actin mrna detection neurons reveals mechanism regulating translatability 
physical manifestation learning memory formation brain can expressed strengthening weakening synaptic connections morphological changes local actin remodeling underlies forms plasticity may facilitated local beta-actin synthesis dynamic information lacking work use single-molecule situ hybridization demonstrate dendritic beta-actin messenger rna mrna ribosomes masked neuron-specific form chemically induced long-term potentiation prompts transient mrna unmasking depends factors active synaptic activity ribosomes single beta-actin mrna motility increase stimulation indicative release complexes hence single-molecule assays developed allow quantification activity-induced unmasking availability active translation work demonstrates beta-actin mrna ribosomes masked state alleviated stimulation
