global stoichiometry litter nitrogen mineralization
plant residue decomposition nutrient release soil play major role global carbon nutrient cycling although decomposition rates vary strongly climate nitrogen immobilization litter release mineral forms mainly controlled initial chemical composition residues used data set similar observations show global nitrogen release patterns can explained fundamental stoichiometric relationships decomposer activity show litter quality controls transition nitrogen accumulation litter release alters decomposers respiration patterns results suggest decomposers lower carbon use efficiency exploit residues low initial nitrogen concentration strategy used broadly bacteria consumers across trophic levels
