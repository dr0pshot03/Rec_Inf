origin moon giant impact near end earths formation 
moon generally believed formed debris ejected large off-centre collision early earth impact orientation size constrained angular momentum contained earths spin moons orbit quantity nearly conserved past billion years simulations potential moon-forming impacts now achieve resolutions sufficient study production bound debris however identifying impacts capable yielding earth-moon system proved difficult- previous works found forming moon appropriate impact angular momentum required impact occur earth half formed restrictive problematic model originally envisaged report class impacts yield iron-poor moon well current masses angular momentum earth-moon system class impacts involves smaller-and thus likely-object previously considered viable suggests moon formed near end earths accumulation
