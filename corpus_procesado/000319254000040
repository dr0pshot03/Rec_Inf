pif1 family helicases suppress genome instability g-quadruplex motifs 
saccharomyces cerevisiae pif1 helicase prototypical member pif1 dna helicase family conserved bacteria humans show exceptionally potent g-quadruplex unwinding conserved among pif1 helicases moreover pif1 helicases organisms separated billion years evolution suppressed dna damage g-quadruplex motifs yeast g-quadruplex-induced damage generated absence pif1 helicases led new genetic epigenetic changes furthermore expressed yeast human pif1 suppressed g-quadruplex-associated dna damage telomere lengthening
