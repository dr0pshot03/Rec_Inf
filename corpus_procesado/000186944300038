delta-promoted filopodia mediate long-range lateral inhibition drosophila
drosophila thoracic mechanosensory bristles originate cells singled proneural groups competent epithelial cells neural competence restricted individual sensory organ precursors sops delta/notch-mediated lateral inhibition whereas cells proneural field adopt epidermal fate precursors large macrochaetes differentiate separately individual proneural clusters comprise cells heterochronic pairs groups cells whereas precursors small regularly spaced microchaetes emerge even larger proneural fields indicates lateral inhibition might act several cell diameters difficult reconcile fact inhibitory ligand delta membrane-bound observation sops frequently extend thin processes offered attractive hypothesis show extension planar filopodia common attribute wing imaginal disc cells promoted delta experimental suppression reduces notch signalling distant cells increases bristle density large proneural groups showing membrane specializations mediate long range lateral inhibition
