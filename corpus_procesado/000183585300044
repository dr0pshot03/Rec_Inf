currently debated whether segmentation different animal phyla common origin shares common genetic mechanism apparent use different genetic networks arthropods vertebrates become strong argument common origin segmentation knowledge arthropod segmentation based mainly insect drosophila hierarchical cascade transcription factors controls segmentation function genes seems conserved among arthropods including spiders vertebrates- notch pathway key role vertebrate segmentation somitogenesis involved drosophila body segmentation show notch delta genes involved segmentation another arthropod spider cupiennius salei expression patterns notch delta coupled rna interference experiments identify many similarities spider segmentation vertebrate somitogenesis data indicate formation segments arthropods vertebrates may shared genetic programme common ancestor parts programme lost particular descendant lineages
