alternative bactericidal mechanism action lantibiotic peptides target lipid ii
lantibiotics polycyclic peptides containing unusual amino acids binding specificity bacterial cells targeting bacterial cell wall component lipid ii form pores thereby lyse cells yet several members lipid ii targeted lantibiotics short able span lipid bilayer form pores somehow maintain antibacterial efficacy describe alternative mechanism members lantibiotic family kill gram-positive bacteria removing lipid ii cell division site septum thus block cell wall synthesis
