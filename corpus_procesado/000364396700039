entangling two transportable neutral atoms via local spin exchange 
advance quantum information science physical systems sought meet stringent requirements creating preserving quantum entanglement atomic physics robust two-qubit entanglement typically achieved strong long-range interactions form either coulomb interactions ions dipolar interactions rydberg atoms1- although interactions allow fast quantum gates interacting atoms must overcome associated coupling environment crosstalk among qubits5- local interactions requiring substantial wavefunction overlap can alleviate detrimental effects; however interactions present new challenge: distribute entanglement qubits must transported merged interaction isolated storage subsequent operations show using mobile optical tweezer possible prepare locally entangle two ultracold neutral atoms separate preserving entanglement9- ground-state neutral atom experiments measured dynamics consistent spin entanglement101213 detected entanglement macroscopic observables1415; now able demonstrate position-resolved two-particle coherence via application local gradient parity measurements new entanglement-verification protocol applied arbitrary spin-entangled states spatially separated atoms1617 local entangling operation achieved via spin-exchange interactions9- quantum tunnelling used combine separate atoms techniques provide framework dynamically entangling remote qubits via local operations within large-scale quantum register
