possible thermal chemical stabilization body-centred-cubic iron earths core 
nature stable phase iron earths solid inner core still highly controversial laboratory experiments suggest possibility uncharacterized phase transformation iron core conditions seismological observations- indicated possible presence complex inner-core layering theoretical studies currently suggest hexagonal close packed h c p phase iron stable core pressures body centred cubic b c c phase iron becomes elastically unstable high pressure h c p metals however high-pressure b c c form found become stabilized high temperature report quantum mechanical study bcc-iron able model behaviour core temperatures well pressures using ab initio molecular dynamics free-energy calculations find bcc-iron indeed becomes entropically stabilized core temperatures pure state hcp-iron still remains thermodynamically favourable inner core however pure iron calculations indicate b c c phase will stabilized respect h c p phase sulphur silicon impurities core consequently bcc-structured alloy may strong candidate explaining observed seismic complexity inner core-
