calcineurin sets bandwidth discrimination signals thymocyte development 
critical times development cells able convert graded signals discrete developmental outcomes however mechanisms involved poorly understood thymocyte development cell fate determined signals originating alpha beta t-cell receptor low-affinity/avidity interactions t-cell receptor peptide-mhc complexes direct differentiation single-positive stage positive selection whereas high-affinity/avidity interactions induce death apoptosis negative selection show mice deficient calcineurin nuclear factor activated t cells nfat c2/c3 lack population preselection thymocytes enhanced ability activate mitogen-activated protein kinase raf-mek-erk pathway fail undergo positive selection defect can partially rescued constitutively active raf indicating calcineurin controls mapk signalling analysis mice deficient bim required negative selection calcineurin revealed calcineurin-induced erk extracellular signal-regulated kinase sensitization required differentiation response weak positive selecting signals response strong negative selecting signals normally induce apoptosis results indicate early calcineurin/nfat signalling produces developmental period erk hypersensitivity allowing weak signals induce positive selection mechanism might generally useful discrimination graded signals induce different cell fates
