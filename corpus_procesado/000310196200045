black mamba venom peptides target acid-sensing ion channels abolish pain 
polypeptide toxins played central part understanding physiological physiopathological functions ion channels field pain led important advances basic research- even clinical applications acid-sensing ion channels asics generally considered principal players pain pathway including humans snake toxin activating peripheral asics nociceptive neurons recently shown evoke pain show new class three-finger peptides another snake black mamba able abolish pain inhibition asics expressed either central peripheral neurons peptides call mambalgins toxic mice show potent analgesic effect upon central peripheral injection can strong morphine effect however resistant naloxone mambalgins cause much less tolerance morphine respiratory distress pharmacological inhibition mambalgins combined use knockdown knockout animals indicates blockade heteromeric channels made asic1a asic2a subunits central neurons asic1b-containing channels nociceptors involved analgesic effect mambalgins findings identify new potential therapeutic targets pain introduce natural peptides block produce potent analgesia
