toughening elastomers sacrificial bonds watching break
elastomers widely used large-strain reversible deformability unfilled elastomers suffer poor mechanical strength limits use using sacrificial bonds show brittle unfilled elastomers can strongly reinforced stiffness toughness megapascals kilojoules per square meter introducing variable proportion isotropically prestretched chains can break dissipate energy material fails chemoluminescent cross-linking molecules emit light break map real time many internal bonds break ahead propagating crack simple methodology use introduce sacrificial bonds combined mapping bonds break potential stimulate development new classes unfilled tough elastomers better molecular models fracture soft materials
