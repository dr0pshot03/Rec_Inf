generally believed within context bardeen-cooper-schrieffer bcs theory superconductivity conduction electrons metal ferromagnetically ordered superconducting even superconductivity interpreted arising magnetic mediation paired electrons thought superconducting state occurs paramagnetic phase report observation superconductivity ferromagnetically ordered phase d-electron compound zrzn2 specific heat anomaly associated superconducting transition material appears absent superconducting state sensitive defects occurring pure samples hydrostatic pressure superconductivity ferromagnetism disappear pressure ferromagnetic state appears prerequisite superconductivity combined recent observation superconductivity uge2 ref results suggest metallic ferromagnets may universally become superconducting magnetization small
