natural killer cells act rheostats modulating antiviral t cells
antiviral t cells thought regulate whether hepatitis c virus hcv human immunodeficiency virus hiv infections result viral control asymptomatic persistence severe disease although reasons different outcomes remain unclear recent genetic evidence however indicated correlation certain natural killer nk-cell receptors progression hiv hcv infection- implying nk cells role t-cell-associated diseases although direct nk-cell-mediated lysis virus-infected cells may contribute antiviral defence virus infections-especially murine cytomegalovirus mcmv infections mice perhaps hiv humans-nk cells also suspected immunoregulatory functions instance nk cells may indirectly regulate t-cell responses lysing mcmv-infected antigen-presenting cells contrast mcmv lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus lcmv infection mice seems resistant direct antiviral effects nk cells examine roles nk cells regulating t-cell-dependent viral persistence immunopathology mice infected lcmv established model hiv hcv infections humans describe three-way interaction whereby activated nk cells cytolytically eliminate activated cd4 t cells affect cd8 t-cell function exhaustion high virus doses nk cells prevented fatal pathology enabling t-cell exhaustion viral persistence medium doses nk cells paradoxically facilitated lethal t-cell-mediated pathology thus nk cells can act rheostats regulating cd4 t-cell-mediated support antiviral cd8 t cells control viral pathogenesis persistence
