metal-ion coordination u6 small nuclear rna contributes catalysis spliceosome 
introns removed nuclear messenger rna precursors two sequential phospho-transesterification reactions dynamic rna-protein complex called spliceosome whether splicing catalysed small nuclear rnas3 spliceosome unresolved spliceosome metalloenzyme- important determine whether snrnas coordinate catalytic metals show yeast u6 snrna coordinates metal ion required catalytic activity spliceosome mg2+ u6 snrna sulphur substitution pro-r-p pro-s-p non-bridging phosphoryl oxygen nucleotide u reconstitutes fully assembled yet catalytically inactive spliceosome adding thiophilic ion mn2+ allows first transesterification reaction occur u6/sus-p u6/su80 r-p-reconstituted spliceosome mg2+ competitively inhibits mn2+-rescued reaction indicating metal-binding site u6/u exists wild-type spliceosome site changes metal requirement activity s-p spliceosome thus u6 snrna contributes pre-messenger rna splicing metal-ion coordination consistent rna catalysis spliceosome
