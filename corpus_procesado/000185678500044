identification plant nitric oxide synthase gene involved hormonal signaling 
nitric oxide serves signal plants arabidopsis mutant atnos1 identified impaired production organ growth abscisic acid-induced stomatal movements expression atnos1 viral promoter atnos1 mutant plants resulted overproduction purified atnos1 protein used substrates arginine nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate activated ca2+ calmodulin-like mammalian endothelial nitric oxide synthase neuronal nitric oxide synthase yet distinct enzyme sequence similarities mammalian isoform thus atnos1 encodes distinct nitric oxide synthase regulates growth hormonal signaling plants
