oscillatory dependence current-driven magnetic domain wall motion current pulse length 
magnetic domain walls magnetization direction varies continuously one direction another long objects considerable interest new concepts devices based domain walls made possible direct manipulation walls using spin-polarized electrical current phenomenon spin momentum transfer experiments date considered current-driven motion domain walls quasi-static conditions- whereas technological applications walls must moved much shorter timescales show motion domain walls nanosecond-long current pulses surprisingly sensitive pulse length particular find probability dislodging domain wall confined pinning site permalloy nanowire oscillates length current pulse period just nanoseconds using analytical model- micromagnetic simulations show behaviour connected current-induced oscillatory motion domain wall period determined walls mass slope confining potential current turned phases domain wall motion enough momentum domain wall driven confining potential opposite direction flow spin angular momentum dynamic amplification effect exploited magnetic nanodevices based domain wall motion
