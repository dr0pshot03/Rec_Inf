thermochemical structures beneath africa pacific ocean 
large low-velocity seismic anomalies detected earths lower mantle beneath africa pacific ocean easily explained temperature variations alone- african anomaly interpreted northwest southeast-trending structure- sharp-edged linear ridgelike morphology pacific anomaly hand appears rounded shape- mantle models heterogeneous composition related structures dense thermochemical piles superplumes- shown however models can lead thermochemical structures satisfy geometrical constraints inferred seismological observations present numerical models thermochemical convection three-dimensional spherical geometry using plate velocities inferred past million years show earths subduction history can lead thermochemical structures similar shape observed large lower-mantle velocity anomalies find subduction history tends focus dense material ridge-like pile beneath africa relatively more-rounded pile pacific ocean consistent seismic observations
