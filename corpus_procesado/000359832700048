salicylic acid modulates colonization root microbiome specific bacterial taxa
immune systems distinguish self nonself maintain homeostasis must differentially gate access allow colonization potentially beneficial nonpathogenic microbes plant roots grow within extremely diverse soil microbial communities assemble taxonomically limited root-associated microbiome grew isogenic arabidopsis thaliana mutants altered immune systems wild soil also recolonization experiments synthetic bacterial community established biosynthesis signaling dependent foliar defense phytohormone salicylic acid required assemble normal root microbiome salicylic acid modulates colonization root specific bacterial families thus plant immune signaling drives selection available microbial communities sculpt root microbiome
