mutational fitness landscapes rna virus revealed population sequencing 
rna viruses exist genetically diverse populations1 thought diversity genetic structure viral populations determine rapid adaptation observed rna viruses2 hence pathogenesis3 however understanding mechanisms underlying virus evolution limited inability accurately describe genetic structure virus populations next-generation sequencing technologies generate data sufficient depth characterize virus populations limited utility variants present low frequencies thus indistinguishable next-generation sequencing errors present approach reduces next-generation sequencing errors allows description virus populations unprecedented accuracy using approach define mutation rates poliovirus uncover mutation landscape population furthermore monitoring changes variant frequencies serially passaged populations determined fitness values thousands mutations across viral genome mapping fitness values onto three-dimensional structures viral proteins offers powerful approach exploring structure-function relationships potentially uncovering new functions knowledge study provides first single-nucleotide fitness landscape evolving rna virus establishes general experimental platform studying genetic changes underlying evolution virus populations
