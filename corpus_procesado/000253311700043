nadp regulates yeast gal induction system 
transcriptional regulation galactose metabolizing genes saccharomyces cerevisiae depends three core proteins: gal4p transcriptional activator binds upstream activating dna sequences uasgal; gal80p repressor binds carboxyl terminus gal4p inhibits transcription; gal3p cytoplasmic transducer upon binding galactose adenosine -triphosphate relieves gal80p repression current model induction relies gal3p sequestering gal80p cytoplasm however rapid induction system implies missing factor structure gal80p complex peptide carboxyl terminal activation domain gal4p reveals existence dinucleotide mediates interaction two biochemical vivo experiments suggests nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate nadp plays key role initial induction event
