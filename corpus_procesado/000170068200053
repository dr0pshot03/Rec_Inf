rpa governs endonuclease switching processing okazaki fragments eukaryotes 
extensive work maturation lagging strands replication simian virus dna suggests initiator rna primers okazaki fragments removed combined action two nucleases rnase hi fen1 okazaki fragments join- despite well established vitro roles two enzymes genetic analyses yeast revealed null mutants rnase hi and/or fen1 lethal- suggesting additional enzymatic activity may required removal rna one enzyme saccharomyces cerevisiae dna2 helicase-/endonuclease essential cell viability well suited removing rna primers okazaki fragments addition dna2 interacts genetically physically several proteins involved elongation maturation okazaki fragments show endonucleases dna2 fen1 act sequentially facilitate complete removal primer rna sequential action enzymes governed single-stranded dna-binding protein replication protein-a rpa results demonstrate processing okazaki fragments eukaryotes differs significantly complicated occurring prokaryotes propose novel biochemical mechanism maturation eukaryotic okazaki fragments
