novel putative auxin carrier family regulates intracellular auxin homeostasis plants 
phytohormone auxin acts prominent signal providing local accumulation depletion selected cells spatial temporal reference changes developmental program- distribution auxin depends auxin metabolism biosynthesis conjugation degradation- cellular auxin transport- identified silico novel putative auxin transport facilitator family called pin-likes pils illustrate pils proteins required auxin-dependent regulation plant growth determining cellular sensitivity auxin pils proteins regulate intracellular auxin accumulation endoplasmic reticulum thus auxin availability nuclear auxin signalling pils activity affects level endogenous auxin indole--acetic acid iaa presumably via intracellular accumulation metabolism findings reveal transport machinery compartmentalize auxin within cell unexpected molecular complexity demonstrate compartmentalization functionally important number developmental processes
