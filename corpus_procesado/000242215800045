dissecting functions mammalian clock protein bmal1 tissue-specific rescue mice 
basic helix-loop-helix bhlh per-arnt-sim pas domain transcription factor bmal1 essential component mammalian circadian pacemaker bmal1-/- mice lose circadian rhythmicity also display tendon calcification decreased activity body weight longevity investigate whether diverse functions bmal1 tissue-specific produced transgenic mice constitutively express bmal1 brain muscle examined effects rescued gene expression bmal1-/- mice circadian rhythms wheel-running activity restored brain-rescued bmal1-/- mice conditional manner however activity levels body weight lower wild-type mice contrast muscle-rescued bmal1-/- mice exhibited normal activity levels body weight yet remained behaviorally arrhythmic thus bmal1 distinct tissue-specific functions regulate integrative physiology
