using neural measures economic value solve public goods free-rider problem 
every social group needs decide provide public goods allocate costs among members ideally decision maximize groups net benefits also ensuring every individuals benefit greater cost pay unfortunately economic theory mechanism design shown ideal solution feasible group leadership know values individual group members public good show impossibility result can overcome laboratory settings combining technologies obtaining neural measures value functional magnetic resonance imaging-based pattern classification carefully designed institutions allocate costs based reported neurally measured values
