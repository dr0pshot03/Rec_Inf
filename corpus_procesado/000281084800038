linear arrays nuclear envelope proteins harness retrograde actin flow nuclear movement 
nuclei move specific locations polarize migrating differentiating cells many nuclear movements microtubule-dependent however nuclear movement reorient centrosome migrating fibroblasts occurs unknown actin-dependent mechanism found linear arrays outer nesprin2g inner sun2 nuclear membrane proteins assembled moved retrogradely moving dorsal actin cables nuclear movement polarizing fibroblasts inhibition nesprin2g sun2 actin prevented nuclear movement centrosome reorientation coupling actin cables nuclear membrane nuclear movement via specific membrane proteins indicates like plasma membrane integrins nuclear membrane proteins assemble actin-dependent arrays force transduction
