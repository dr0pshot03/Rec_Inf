polyploids exhibit higher potassium uptake salinity tolerance arabidopsis
genome duplication polyploidization occurred throughout plant evolutionary history thought driven adaptive radiation plants found cytotype root genotype determined majority heritable natural variation leaf potassium k concentration arabidopsis thaliana autopolyploidy also provided resistance salinity may represent adaptive outcome enhanced k accumulation plants higher ploidy
