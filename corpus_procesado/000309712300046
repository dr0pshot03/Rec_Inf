forces driving epithelial spreading zebrafish gastrulation 
contractile actomyosin rings drive various fundamental morphogenetic processes ranging cytokinesis wound healing actomyosin rings generally thought function circumferential contraction show spreading enveloping cell layer evl yolk cell zebrafish gastrulation driven contractile actomyosin ring contrast previous suggestions find ring functions circumferential contraction also flow-friction mechanism generates pulling force resistance retrograde actomyosin flow evl spreading proceeds normally situations circumferential contraction unproductive indicating flow-friction mechanism sufficient thus actomyosin rings can function epithelial morphogenesis combination cable-constriction flow-friction mechanisms
