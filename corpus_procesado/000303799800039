comparing yields organic conventional agriculture
numerous reports emphasized need major changes global food system: agriculture must meet twin challenge feeding growing population rising demand meat high-calorie diets simultaneously minimizing global environmental impacts organic farming-a system aimed producing food minimal harm ecosystems animals humans-is often proposed solution however critics argue organic agriculture may lower yields therefore need land produce amount food conventional farms resulting widespread deforestation bio-diversity loss thus undermining environmental benefits organic practices use comprehensive meta-analysis examine relative yield performance organic conventional farming systems globally analysis available data shows overall organic yields typically lower conventional yields yield differences highly contextual depending system site characteristics range % lower organic yields rain-fed legumes perennials weak-acidic weak-alkaline soils % lower yields best organic practices used % lower yields conventional organic systems comparable certain conditions-that good management practices particular crop types growing conditions-organic systems can thus nearly match conventional yields whereas others present establish organic agriculture important tool sustainable food production factors limiting organic yields need fully understood alongside assessments many social environmental economic benefits organic farming systems
