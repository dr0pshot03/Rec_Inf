phosphate important nutrient restricts microbial production many freshwater1- marine environments4- actual concentration phosphate phosphorus-limited waters largely unknown commonly used chemical radiochemical techniques overestimate concentration78 using new steady-state radiobioassay survey diverse set lakes report phosphate concentrations lakes orders magnitude lower estimates made spectrophotometrically frequently used rigler radiobioassay results combined literature indicate microbes can achieve rapid turnover rates picomolar nutrient concentrations occurs even though concentrations two orders magnitude level phosphate uptake estimated half saturation level picoplankton community also phosphate concentration increased concentration total phosphorus soluble reactive phosphorus lakes sampled proportion phosphate total phosphorus pool decreased oligotrophic eutrophic lakes information revealed phosphate assay use allow us address hypotheses concerning concentration phosphate available planktonic microorganisms aquatic systems
