ultraslow-spreading class ocean ridge 
new investigations southwest indian arctic ridges reveal ultraslow-spreading class ocean ridge characterized intermittent volcanism lack transform faults find mantle beneath ridges emplaced continuously seafloor large regions differences ultraslow slow-spreading ridges great slow fast-spreading ridges ultraslow spreading ridges usually form full spreading rates less mm yr- though characteristics commonly found rates approximately mm yr- ultraslow-spreading ridges consist linked magmatic amagmatic accretionary ridge segments amagmatic segments previously unrecognized class accretionary plate boundary structure can assume orientation angles relative spreading direction ranging orthogonal acute amagmatic segments sometimes coexist magmatic ridge segments millions years form stable plate boundaries may displace displaced transforms magmatic ridge segments spreading rate mantle thermal structure ridge geometry change
