distilling free-form natural laws experimental data 
centuries scientists attempted identify document analytical laws underlie physical phenomena nature despite prevalence computing power process finding natural laws corresponding equations resisted automation key challenge finding analytic relations automatically defining algorithmically makes correlation observed data important insightful propose principle identification nontriviality demonstrated approach automatically searching motion-tracking data captured various physical systems ranging simple harmonic oscillators chaotic double-pendula without prior knowledge physics kinematics geometry algorithm discovered hamiltonians lagrangians laws geometric momentum conservation discovery rate accelerated laws found simpler systems used bootstrap explanations complex systems gradually uncovering "alphabet" used describe systems
