atp release guides neutrophil chemotaxis via p2y2 a3 receptors 
cells must amplify external signals orient migrate chemotactic gradient fields find human neutrophils release adenosine triphosphate atp leading edge cell surface amplify chemotactic signals direct cell orientation feedback p2y2 nucleotide receptors neutrophils rapidly hydrolyze released atp adenosine acts via a3-type adenosine receptors recruited leading edge promote cell migration thus atp release autocrine feedback p2y2 a3 receptors provide signal amplification controlling gradient sensing migration neutrophils
