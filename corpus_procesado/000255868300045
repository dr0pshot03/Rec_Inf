cell identity mediates response arabidopsis roots abiotic stress 
little known way developmental cues affect cells interpret environment characterized transcriptional response high salinity different cell layers developmental stages arabidopsis root found transcriptional responses highly constrained developmental parameters transcriptional changes lead differential regulation specific biological functions subsets cell layers several correspond observable physiological changes showed known stress pathways primarily control semiubiquitous responses used mutants disrupt epidermal patterning reveal cell-layer-specific inter-cell-layer effects performing similar analysis using iron deprivation identified common cell-type-specific stress responses revealed crucial role environment plays defining transcriptional outcome cell-fate decisions
