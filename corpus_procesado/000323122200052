gut lipid messenger links excess dietary fat dopamine deficiency 
excessive intake dietary fats leads diminished brain dopaminergic function proposed dopamine deficiency exacerbates obesity provoking compensatory overfeeding one way restore reward sensitivity however physiological mechanisms linking prolonged high-fat intake dopamine deficiency remain elusive show administering oleoylethanolamine gastrointestinal lipid messenger whose synthesis suppressed prolonged high-fat exposure sufficient restore gut-stimulated dopamine release high-fat-fed mice administering oleoylethanolamine high-fat-fed mice also eliminated motivation deficits flavorless intragastric feeding increased oral intake low-fat emulsions findings suggest high-fat-induced gastrointestinal dysfunctions play key role dopamine deficiency restoring gut-generated lipid signaling may increase reward value less palatable yet healthier foods
