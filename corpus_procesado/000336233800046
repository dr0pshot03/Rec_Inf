mechanisms reef coral resistance future climate change
reef corals highly sensitive heat yet populations resistant climate change recently identified determine mechanisms temperature tolerance reciprocally transplanted corals reef sites experiencing distinct temperature regimes tested subsequent physiological gene expression profiles local acclimatization fixed effects adaptation contributed equally heat tolerance reflected patterns gene expression less years acclimatization achieves heat tolerance expect strong natural selection many generations long-lived organisms results show short-term acclimatory longer-term adaptive acquisition climate resistance adding adaptive abilities ecosystem models likely slow predictions demise coral reef ecosystems
