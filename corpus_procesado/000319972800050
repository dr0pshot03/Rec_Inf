role tissue protection lethal respiratory viral-bacterial coinfection 
secondary bacterial pneumonia leads increased morbidity mortality influenza virus infections causes increased susceptibility however well defined host defense infection relies immune resistance mechanisms also ability tolerate given level pathogen burden failure either resistance tolerance can contribute disease severity making hard distinguish relative contribution employ coinfection mouse model influenza virus legionella pneumophila can separate resistance tolerance demonstrate influenza virus can promote susceptibility lethal bacterial coinfection even bacterial infection controlled immune system propose failure host defense due impaired ability tolerate tissue damage
