herbivory-induced volatiles elicit defence genes lima bean leaves
response herbivore damage several plant species emit volatiles attract natural predators attacking herbivores- using spider mites tetranychus urticae predatory mites phytoseiulus persimilis- shown attacked plant also neighbouring plants affected becoming attractive predatory mites less susceptible spider mites mechanism involved interactions however remains elusive show uninfested lima bean leaves activate five separate defence genes exposed volatiles conspecific leaves infested t urticae exposed volatiles artificially wounded leaves expression pattern genes similar produced exposure jasmonic acid least three terpenoids volatiles responsible gene activation released response herbivory artificial wounding expression genes requires calcium influx protein phosphorylation/dephosphorylation
