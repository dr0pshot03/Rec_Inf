highly regioselective amination unactivated alkanes hypervalent sulfonylimino-lambda-bromane 
amination alkanes generally required metal catalysts and/or high temperatures report simple exposure broad range alkanes n-triflylimino-lambda-bromane ambient temperature results c-h insertion nitrogen functionality afford triflyl-substituted amines moderate high yields marked selectivity tertiary secondary c-h bonds observed primary methyl c-h bonds inert addition hexafluoroisopropanol inhibit decomposition dramatically improved c-h amination efficiencies second-order kinetics activation parameters negative activation entropy deuterium isotope effects theoretical calculations suggest concerted asynchronous bimolecular transition state metal-free c-h amination event
