pyroclastic activity home plate gusev crater mars
home plate layered plateau gusev crater mars composed clastic rocks moderately altered alkali basalt composition enriched highly volatile elements coarse-grained lower unit lies finer-grained upper unit textural observations indicate lower strata emplaced explosive event geochemical considerations favor explosive volcanic origin impact origin lower unit likely represents accumulation pyroclastic materials whereas upper unit may represent eolian reworking pyroclastic materials
