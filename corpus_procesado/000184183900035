nanometre-scale displacement sensing using single electron transistor
long-standing goal detect effects quantum mechanics macroscopic mechanical oscillator- position measurements oscillator ultimately limited quantum mechanics zero-point motion fluctuations quantum ground state combine uncertainty relation yield lower limit measured average displacement development position transducer integrated mechanical resonator can approach limit important applications detection weak forces example magnetic resonance force microsopy variety precision experiments- one implementation might allow near quantum-limited sensitivity use single electron transistor set displacement sensor-: exquisite charge sensitivity set cryogenic temperatures exploited measure motion capacitively coupling mechanical resonator present experimental realization device yielding unequalled displacement sensitivity 2x10- m hz-/ mhz mechanical oscillator temperature mk-a sensitivity roughly factor larger quantum limit oscillator
