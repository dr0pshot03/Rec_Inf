satellite view aerosols climate system 
anthropogenic aerosols intricately linked climate system hydrologic cycle net effect aerosols cool climate system reflecting sunlight depending composition aerosols can also absorb sunlight atmosphere cooling surface warming atmosphere process effects aerosols temperature profile along role aerosols cloud condensation nuclei impact hydrologic cycle changes cloud cover cloud properties precipitation unravelling feedbacks particularly difficult aerosols take multitude shapes forms ranging desert dust urban pollution aerosol concentrations vary strongly time space accurately study aerosol distribution composition therefore requires continuous observations satellites networks ground-based instruments dedicated field experiments increases aerosol concentration changes composition driven industrialization expanding population may adversely affect earths climate water supply
