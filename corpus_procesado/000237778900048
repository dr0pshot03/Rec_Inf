simple rule evolution cooperation graphs social networks
fundamental aspect biological systems cooperation cooperative interactions required many levels biological organization ranging single cells groups animals- human society based large extent mechanisms promote cooperation- well known unstructured populations natural selection favours defectors cooperators much current interest however studying evolutionary games structured populations graphs- efforts recognize fact who-meets-whom random determined spatial relationships social networks- describe surprisingly simple rule good approximation graphs analysed including cycles spatial lattices random regular graphs random graphs scale-free networks: natural selection favours cooperation benefit altruistic act b divided cost c exceeds average number neighbours k means b/c > k case cooperation can evolve consequence social viscosity even absence reputation effects strategic complexity
