niche filling slows diversification himalayan songbirds 
speciation generally involves three-step process-range expansion range fragmentation development reproductive isolation spatially separated populations speciation relies cycling three steps may limit rate new species form estimate phylogenetic relationships among himalayan songbirds ask whether development reproductive isolation ecological competition factors limit range expansions set ultimate limit speciation based phylogeny species distributed along eastern elevational gradient show body size shape differences evolved early radiation elevational band occupied species evolving later results consistent competition niche space limiting species accumulation even elevation dimension seems approaching ecological saturation closest relatives inside assemblage elsewhere himalayas average separated five million years longer generally takes reproductive isolation completed also elevational distributions well explained resource availability notably abundance arthropods differences diversification rates different elevational zones results imply speciation rate ultimately set niche fillingthat ecological competition resources rather rate acquisition reproductive isolation
