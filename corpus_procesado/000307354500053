pi4p pi45p- essential independent lipid determinants membrane identity 
quantitatively minor phospholipid phosphatidylinositol -bisphosphate [pi45p-] fulfills many cellular functions plasma membrane pm whereas synthetic precursor phosphatidylinositol -phosphate pi4p assigned pm roles apart pi45p- synthesis used combination pharmacological chemical genetic approaches probe function pm pi4p required synthesis functions pi45p- however depletion lipids required prevent pm targeting proteins interact acidic lipids activation transient receptor potential vanilloid cation channel therefore pi4p contributes pool polyanionic lipids define plasma membrane identity functions previously attributed specifically pi45p- may fulfilled general polyanionic lipid requirement
