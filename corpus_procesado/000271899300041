ultraflat graphene
graphene single atomic layer carbon connected sp hybridized bonds attracted intense scientific interest since recent discovery much research graphene directed towards exploration novel electronic properties structural aspects model two-dimensional system also great interest importance particular microscopic corrugations observed suspended supported- graphene sheets studied far rippling invoked explain thermodynamic stability free-standing graphene sheets many distinctive electronic- chemical- properties graphene attributed presence ripples also predicted give rise new physical phenomena- absent planar two-dimensional material direct experimental study novel ripple physics however hindered lack flat graphene layers demonstrate fabrication graphene monolayers flat atomic level samples produced deposition atomically flat terraces cleaved mica surfaces apparent height variation graphene layers observed high-resolution atomic force microscopy afm less picometres indicating suppression existing intrinsic ripples graphene availability ultraflat samples will permit rigorous testing impact ripples various physical chemical properties graphene
