ultrafast carbon-carbon single-bond rotational isomerization room-temperature solution 
generally rotational isomerization carbon-carbon single bond simple ethane derivatives room-temperature solution thermal equilibrium conditions fast measure achieved goal using two-dimensional infrared vibrational echo spectroscopy observe isomerization gauche trans conformations ethane derivative -fluoro--isocyanato-ethane ccl4 solution room temperature isomerization time constant picoseconds ps - s based value density functional theory calculations barrier heights n-butane ethane time constants n-butane ethane internal rotation conditions similar similar ps respectively
