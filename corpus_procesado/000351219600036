multiwavelength achromatic metasurfaces dispersive phase compensation 
replacement bulk refractive optical elements diffractive planar components enables miniaturization optical systems however diffractive optics suffers large chromatic aberrations due dispersion phase accumulated light propagation show limitation can overcome engineered wavelength-dependent phase shift imparted metasurface demonstrate design deflects three wavelengths angle planar lens without chromatic aberrations three wavelengths also presented designs based low-loss dielectric resonators introduce dense spectrum optical modes enable dispersive phase compensation suppression chromatic aberrations metasurface-based planar photonics will find applications lightweight collimators displays well chromatically corrected imaging systems
