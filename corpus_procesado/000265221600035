contrasting developmental trajectories earliest known tetrapod forelimbs
ichthyostega acanthostega earliest tetrapods known multiple near-complete skeletons acanthostega generally considered primitive new material indicates differing ontogenetic trajectories forelimbs: ichthyostega pattern muscle attachment processes small humeri upper arm bones resembles fish members tetrapod stem group tiktaalik whereas large humeri approach fail attain tetrapod crown-group condition acanthostega small large humeri exhibit crown-group pattern infer ichthyostega underwent greater locomotory terrestrialization ontogeny newly recognized primitive characteristics also suggest ichthyostega phylogenetically basal acanthostega
