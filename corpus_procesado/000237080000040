electron-phonon coupling reflecting dynamic charge inhomogeneity copper oxide superconductors 
attempt understand copper oxide superconductors complicated presence multiple strong interactions systems many believe antiferromagnetism important superconductivity renewed interest possible role electron-lattice coupling1- conventional superconductor mgb2 strong electron-lattice coupling involving particular vibrational mode phonon predicted standard theory confirmed quantitatively experiment5 present inelastic scattering measurements show similarly strong anomaly cu-o bond-stretching phonon copper oxide superconductors la2-xsrxcuo4 x007 conventional theory predict behaviour anomaly strongest la1875ba0125cuo4 la148nd04sr012cuo4 compounds exhibit spatially modulated charge magnetic order often called stripe order6; occurs wave vector corresponding charge order results suggest giant electron-phonon anomaly absent undoped over-doped non-superconductors associated charge inhomogeneity follows electron-phonon coupling may important understanding superconductivity although contribution likely indirect
