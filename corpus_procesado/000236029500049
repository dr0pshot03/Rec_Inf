parietal-eye phototransduction components potential evolutionary implications
parietal-eye photoreceptor unique two antagonistic light signaling pathways cell hyperpolarizing pathway maximally sensitive blue light depolarizing pathway maximally sensitive green light report molecular components two pathways found two opsins cell: blue-sensitive pinopsin previously unidentified green-sensitive opsin name parietopsin signaling components included gustducin-alpha g alphao rod cone transducin-alpha single-cell recordings demonstrated go mediates depolarizing response gustducin-alpha resembles transducin-alpha functionally likely mediates hyperpolarizing response parietopsin-go signaling pair provides clues rod cone phototransduction might evolved
