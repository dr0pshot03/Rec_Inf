rev-erb alpha heme sensor coordinates metabolic circadian pathways 
circadian clock temporally coordinates metabolic homeostasis mammals central heme iron containing porphyrin serves prosthetic group enzymes involved oxidative metabolism well transcription factors regulate circadian rhythmicity circadian factor integrates dual function heme known show heme binds reversibly orphan nuclear receptor rev-erb alpha critical negative component circadian core clock regulates interaction nuclear receptor corepressor complex furthermore heme suppresses hepatic gluconeogenic gene expression glucose output rev-erb alpha-mediated gene repression thus rev-erb alpha serves heme sensor coordinates cellular clock glucose homeostasis energy metabolism
