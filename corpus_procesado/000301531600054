transcription factor c-maf controls touch receptor development function
sense touch relies detection mechanical stimuli specialized mechanosensory neurons scarcity molecular data made difficult analyze development mechanoreceptors define basis diversity function show transcription factor c-maf/c-maf crucial mechanosensory function mice humans development function several rapidly adapting mechanoreceptor types disrupted c-maf mutant mice particular pacinian corpuscles type mechanoreceptor specialized detect high-frequency vibrations severely atrophied line sensitivity high-frequency vibration reduced humans carrying dominant mutation c-maf gene thus work identifies key transcription factor specifying development function mechanoreceptors end organs
