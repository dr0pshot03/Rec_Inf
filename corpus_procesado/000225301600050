low gene duplication rate yeast genome
gene duplication rate yeast genome estimated without assuming molecular clock model similar to0 per gene per billion years rate two orders magnitude lower previous estimate based molecular clock model difference explained extensive concerted evolution via gene conversion duplicated genes violates assumption molecular clock analyses duplicated genes average length period concerted evolution gene conversion rate estimated similar to25 million years similar to28 times mutation rate respectively
