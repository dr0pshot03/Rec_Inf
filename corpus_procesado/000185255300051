resistance enediyne antitumor antibiotics calc self-sacrifice 
antibiotic self-resistance mechanisms include drug elimination drug modi cation target modi cation drug sequestration contribute substantially growing problem antibiotic resistance among pathogenic bacteria enediynes among potent naturally occurring antibiotics yet mechanism resistance toxins remained mystery characterize enediyne self-resistance protein reveals self-sacrificing paradigm resistance highly reactive antibiotics thus another opportunity nonpathogenic pathogenic bacteria evade extremely potent small molecules
