optical pumping vibrational cooling molecules
methods producing cold molecules cold atoms tend leave molecular ensembles substantial residual internal energy instance cesium molecules initially formed via photoassociation cold cesium atoms several vibrational levels nu electronic ground state applied broadband femtosecond laser redistributes vibrational population ground state via electronic excitation/ spontaneous emission cycles laser pulses shaped remove excitation frequency band nu level preventing re excitation state observed fast efficient accumulation similar % initially detected molecules lowest vibrational level nu singlet electronic state validity incoherent depopulation pumping method general opens exciting prospects laser cooling manipulation molecules
