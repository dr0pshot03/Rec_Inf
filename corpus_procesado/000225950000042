global identification human transcribed sequences genome tiling arrays 
elucidating transcribed regions genome constitutes fundamental aspect human biology yet remains outstanding problem comprehensively identify coding sequences constructed series high-density oligonucleotide tiling arrays representing sense antisense strands entire nonrepetitive sequence human genome transcribed sequences located across genome via hybridization complementary dna samples reverse-transcribed polyadenylated rna obtained human liver tissue addition identifying many known predicted genes found transcribed sequences detected methods large fraction located intergenic regions distal previously annotated genes exhibit significant homology mammalian proteins
