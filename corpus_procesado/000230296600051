rac1b reactive oxygen species mediate mmp--induced emt genomic instability 
tumour microenvironment can potent carcinogen facilitating cancer progression activating dormant cancer cells also stimulating tumour formation previously investigated stromelysin-/matrix metalloproteinase mmp- stromal enzyme upregulated many breast tumours found mmp can cause epithelial-mesenchymal transition emt malignant transformation cultured cells- genomically unstable mammary carcinomas transgenic mice explain molecular pathways mmp exerts effects: exposure mouse mammary epithelial cells mmp induces expression alternatively spliced form rac1 causes increase cellular reactive oxygen species ros ros stimulate expression transcription factor snail emt cause oxidative damage dna genomic instability findings identify previously undescribed pathway component breast tumour microenvironment alters cellular structure culture tissue structure vivo leading malignant transformation
