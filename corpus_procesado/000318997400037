dual molecular signals mediate bacterial response outer-membrane stress
gram-negative bacteria outer-membrane integrity essential survival monitored sigmae stress-response system initiates damage-repair pathways one activating signal unassembled outer-membrane proteins using biochemical genetic experiments escherichia coli found off-pathway intermediates lipopolysaccharide transport assembly provided additional required signal distinct signals arising disruptions transport assembly major outer-membrane components jointly determined rate proteolytic destruction negative regulator sigmae transcription factor thereby modulating expression stress-response genes dual-signal system permits rapid response dysfunction outer-membrane biogenesis buffering responses transient fluctuations individual components may represent broad strategy bacteria monitor interface environment
