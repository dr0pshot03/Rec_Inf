modulation hydrophobic interactions proximally immobilized ions 
structure water near non-polar molecular fragments surfaces mediates hydrophobic interactions underlie broad range interfacial colloidal biophysical phenomena- substantial progress past decade improved understanding hydrophobic interactions simple model systems- biologically technologically relevant structures contain non-polar domains close proximity polar charged functional groups theories simulations exploring nanometre-scale chemical heterogeneity find can important effect- influence heterogeneity hydrophobic interactions tested experimentally report chemical force microscopy measurements alkyl-functionalized surfaces reveal dramatic change surfaces hydrophobic interaction strengths coimmobilization amine guanidine groups protonation amine groups doubles strength hydrophobic interactions guanidinium groups eliminate measurable hydrophobic interactions ph ranges investigated see divergent effects proximally immobilized cations also single-molecule measurements conformationally stable beta-peptides non-polar subunits located one nanometre either amine guanidine-bearing subunits results demonstrate importance nanometre-scale chemical heterogeneity hydrophobicity intrinsic property given non-polar domain strongly modulated functional groups located far away one nanometre judicious placing charged groups near hydrophobic domains thus provides strategy tuning hydrophobic driving forces optimize molecular recognition self-assembly processes
