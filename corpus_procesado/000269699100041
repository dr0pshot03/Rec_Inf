g protein-coupled receptor essential schwann cells initiate myelination 
myelin sheath allows axons conduct action potentials rapidly vertebrate nervous system axonal signals activate expression specific transcription factors including oct6 krox20 initiate myelination schwann cells elevation cyclic adenosine monophosphate camp can mimic axonal contact vitro mechanisms regulate camp levels vivo unknown using mutational analysis zebrafish found g protein-coupled receptor gpr126 required autonomously schwann cells myelination gpr126 mutants schwann cells failed express oct6 krox20 arrested promyelinating stage elevation camp gpr126 mutants krox20 mutants restore myelination propose gpr126 drives differentiation promyelinating schwann cells elevating camp levels thereby triggering oct6 expression myelination
