survival brown dwarf engulfment red giant star
many sub-stellar companions usually planets also brown dwarfs orbit solar-type stars stars can engulf sub-stellar companions become red giants interaction may explain several outstanding problems astrophysics- unclear conditions low mass companion will evaporate survive interaction unchanged gain mass observational tests models interaction hampered lack positively identified remnants white dwarf stars close sub-stellar companions companion pre-white dwarf aa doradus may brown dwarf uncertain history star extreme luminosity difference components make difficult interpret observations put strong constraints models magnetic white dwarf sdss j121209+ may close brown dwarf companion little known binary present report discovery brown dwarf short period orbit around white dwarf properties stars binary can directly observed show brown dwarf engulfed red giant little effect
