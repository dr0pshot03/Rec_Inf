noise gene expression determines cell fate bacillus subtilis
random cell-to-cell variations gene expression within isogenic population can lead transitions alternative states gene expression little known variations noise natural systems affect transitions bacillus subtilis noise comk protein regulates competence dna uptake thought cause cells transition competent state genes encoding dna uptake proteins expressed demonstrate noise comk expression selects cells competence experimental reduction noise decreases number competent cells also show transitions limited temporally reduction comk transcription results illustrate stochastic transitions regulated natural system suggest noise characteristics subject evolutionary forces
