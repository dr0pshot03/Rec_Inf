pyrimidine homeostasis accomplished directed overflow metabolism 
cellular metabolism converts available nutrients usable energy biomass precursors process regulated facilitate efficient nutrient use metabolic homeostasis feedback inhibition first committed step pathway final product classical means controlling biosynthesis- canonical example first committed enzyme pyrimidine pathway escherichia coli allosterically inhibited cytidine triphosphate physiological consequences disrupting regulation however previously explored identify alternative regulatory strategy enables precise control pyrimidine pathway end-product levels even presence dysregulated biosynthetic flux mechanism involves cooperative feedback regulation near-terminal pathway enzyme uridine monophosphate kinase feedback leads build-up pathway intermediate uridine monophosphate turn degraded conserved phosphatase termed umph previously unknown physiological function directed overflow metabolism allows homeostasis uridine triphosphate cytidine triphosphate levels expense uracil excretion slower growth energy limitation disruption directed overflow regulatory mechanism impairs growth pyrimidine-rich environments thus pyrimidine homeostasis involves dual regulatory strategies classical feedback inhibition enhancing metabolic efficiency directed overflow metabolism ensuring end-product homeostasis
