sestrin feedback inhibitor tor prevents age-related pathologies 
sestrins conserved proteins accumulate cells exposed stress potentiate adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase ampk inhibit activation target rapamycin tor show abundance drosophila sestrin dsesn increased upon chronic tor activation accumulation reactive oxygen species cause activation c-jun amino-terminal kinase transcription factor forkhead box o foxo loss dsesn resulted age-associated pathologies including triglyceride accumulation mitochondrial dysfunction muscle degeneration cardiac malfunction prevented pharmacological activation ampk inhibition tor hence dsesn appears negative feedback regulator tor integrates metabolic stress inputs prevents pathologies caused chronic tor activation may result diminished autophagic clearance damaged mitochondria protein aggregates lipids
