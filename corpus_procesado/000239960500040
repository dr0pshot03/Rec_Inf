nmda-receptor-mediated cell-specific integration new neurons adult dentate gyrus
new neurons continuously integrated existing neural circuits adult dentate gyrus mammalian brain- accumulating evidence indicates new neurons involved learning memory- substantial fraction newly born neurons die mature survival new neurons regulated experience-dependent manner raising possibility selective survival death new neurons direct role process learning memory information storage information-specific construction new circuits however critical assumption hypothesis survival death decision new neurons information-specific neurons receive information primarily input synaptic activity investigated whether survival new neurons regulated input activity cell-specific manner developed retrovirus-mediated single-cell gene knockout technique mice showed survival new neurons competitively regulated nmda-type glutamate receptor short critical period soon neuronal birth finding indicates survival new neurons resulting formation new circuits regulated input-dependent cell-specific manner therefore circuits formed new neurons may represent information associated input activity within short time window critical period information-specific addition new circuits selective survival death new neurons may unique attribute new neurons enables play critical role learning memory
