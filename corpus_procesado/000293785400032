highly conserved neutralizing epitope group influenza viruses 
current flu vaccines provide limited coverage seasonal strains influenza viruses identification vh1- antibodies broadly neutralize almost influenza group viruses constituted breakthrough influenza field report isolation characterization human monoclonal antibody cr8020 broad neutralizing activity group viruses including h3n2 h7n7 cause severe human infection crystal structure fab cr8020 pandemic h3 hemagglutinin ha reveals highly conserved epitope ha stalk distinct epitope recognized vh1- group antibodies thus cocktail two antibodies may sufficient neutralize influenza subtypes hence enable development universal flu vaccine broad-spectrum antibody therapies
