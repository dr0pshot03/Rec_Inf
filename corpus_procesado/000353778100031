beyond crystallography: diffractive imaging using coherent x-ray light sources 
x-ray crystallography central development many fields science past century now matured point long good-quality crystals available atomic structure can routinely determined three dimensions however many samples physics chemistry materials science nanoscience geology biology noncrystalline thus three-dimensional structures accessible traditional x-ray crystallography overcoming hurdle required development new coherent imaging methods harness new coherent x-ray light sources review revolutionary advances transforming x-ray sources imaging 21st century
