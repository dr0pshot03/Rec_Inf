non-fermentative pathways synthesis branched-chain higher alcohols biofuels
global energy environmental problems stimulated increased efforts towards synthesizing biofuels renewable resources- compared traditional biofuel ethanol higher alcohols offer advantages gasoline substitutes higher energy density lower hygroscopicity addition branched chain alcohols higher octane numbers compared straight chain counterparts however alcohols synthesized economically using native organisms present metabolic engineering approach using escherichia coli produce higher alcohols including isobutanol butanol methyl butanol methyl butanol phenylethanol glucose renewable carbon source strategy uses hosts highly active amino acid biosynthetic pathway diverts keto acid intermediates alcohol synthesis particular achieved high yield high specificity production isobutanol glucose strategy enables exploration biofuels beyond naturally accumulated high quantities microbial fermentation
