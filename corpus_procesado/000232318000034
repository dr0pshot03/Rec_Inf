hsp90 potentiates rapid evotution new traits: drug resistance diverse fungi 
hsp90 molecular chaperone many signal transducers may influence evolution releasing previously silent genetic variation response environmental change fungi separated similar million years evolution hsp90 potentiated evolution drug resistance different way enabling new mutations immediate phenotypic consequences resistance abrogated hsp90 inhibitors febrile temperatures suggesting new therapeutic strategies clinical benefit fever selection human host drug resistance initially hsp90-dependent evolved toward independence thus hsp90 can act diverse ways couple environmental contingency emergence fixation new traits
