design functional metalloproteins 
metalloproteins catalyse complex important processes nature photosynthesis water oxidation ultimate test knowledge metalloproteins work design new metalloproteins can reveal hidden structural features may missing studies native metalloproteins variants also can result new metalloenzymes biotechnological pharmaceutical applications although much challenging design metalloproteins non-metalloproteins much progress made area particularly functional design owing recent advances areas computational structural biology
