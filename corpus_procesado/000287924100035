hotspots aberrant epigenomic reprogramming human induced pluripotent stem cells
induced pluripotent stem cells ipscs offer immense potential regenerative medicine studies disease development somatic cell reprogramming involves epigenomic reconfiguration conferring ipscs characteristics similar embryonic stem es cells however remains unknown complete reestablishment es-cell-like dna methylation patterns throughout genome report first whole-genome profiles dna methylation single-base resolution five human ipsc lines along methylomes es cells somatic cells differentiated ipscs es cells ipscs show significant reprogramming variability including somatic memory aberrant reprogramming dna methylation ipscs share megabase-scale differentially methylated regions proximal centromeres telomeres display incomplete reprogramming non-cg methylation differences cg methylation histone modifications lastly differentiation ipscs trophoblast cells revealed errors reprogramming cg methylation transmitted high frequency providing ipsc reprogramming signature maintained differentiation
