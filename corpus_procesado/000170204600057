role inorganic polyphosphate promoting ribosomal protein degradation ion protease e-coli
inorganic polyphosphate polyp polymer hundreds phosphate p-i residues accumulates escherichia coli response stresses including amino acid starvation show adenosine -triphosphate-dependent protease lon formed complex polyp degraded ribosomal proteins including s2 l9 l13 purified s2 also bound polyp formed complex lon presence polyp thus polyp may promote ribosomal protein degradation lon protease thereby supplying amino acids needed respond starvation
