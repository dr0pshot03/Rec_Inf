systematic design chemical oscillators using complexation precipitation equilibria 
concentration oscillations ubiquitous living systems involve wide range chemical species contrast early vitro chemical oscillators derived two accidentally discovered reactions- based oxyhalogen chemistry past years use systematic design algorithm slow feedback reaction periodically drives bistable system flow reactor two steady states increased list oscillating chemical reactions dozens systems oscillating reactions still confined handful elements possess multiple stable oxidation states: halogens sulphur transition metals show linking core oscillator complexation precipitation equilibrium can induce concentration oscillations species participating equilibrium use method design systems produce periodic pulses calcium aluminium fluoride ions ability generate oscillations elements possessing single stable oxidation state example na+ f- ca+ may lead reactions useful coupling probing living systems help us understand new mechanisms periodic behaviour may arise
