snare proteins: one fuse three keep nascent fusion pore open
neurotransmitters released nascent fusion pores ordinarily dilate bilayer fusion preventing consistent biochemical studies used lipid bilayer nanodiscs fusion partners rigid protein framework prevents dilation reveals properties fusion pore induced snare soluble n-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor found although one snare per nanodisc required maximum rates bilayer fusion efficient release content physiologically relevant time scale synaptic transmission apparently requires three snare complexes snarepins native transmembrane domain vesicle-associated membrane protein vamp2 suggest several snarepins simultaneously zippering snare transmembrane helices within freshly fused bilayers provide radial force prevents nascent pore resealing synchronous neurotransmitter release
