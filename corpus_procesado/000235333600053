variable gene expression within clonal population cells implicated number important processes including mutation evolution determination cell fates development genetic disease recent studies demonstrated significant component expression variability arises extrinsic factors thought influence multiple genes simultaneously- yet biological origins extrinsic variability received little attention combine computational modelling- fluorescence data generated multiple promoter gene inserts saccharomyces cerevisiae identify two major sources extrinsic variability one unavoidable source arising coupling gene expression population dynamics leads ubiquitous lower limit expression variability second source modelled originating common upstream transcription factor exemplifies regulatory networks can convert noise upstream regulator expression extrinsic noise output target gene results highlight importance interplay gene regulatory networks population heterogeneity understanding origins cellular diversity
