direct restart replication fork stalled head-on rna polymerase
vivo studies suggest replication forks arrested encounters head-on transcription complexes yet fate replisome rna polymerase rnap head-on collision unknown found escherichia coli replisome stalls upon collision head-on transcription complex instead collapsing replication fork remains highly stable eventually resumes elongation displacing rnap dna also found transcription-repair coupling factor mfd promotes direct restart fork collision facilitating displacement rnap findings demonstrate intrinsic stability replication apparatus previously unknown role transcription-coupled repair pathway promoting replication past rnap block
