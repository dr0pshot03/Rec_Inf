direct protein-protein coupling enables cross-talk dopamine d5 gamma-aminobutyric acid receptors 
gabaa gamma-aminobutyric-acid dopamine d1 d5 receptors represent two structurally functionally divergent families neurotransmitter receptors former comprises class multi-subunit ligand-gated channels mediating fast interneuronal synaptic transmission whereas latter belongs seven-transmembrane-domain single-polypeptide receptor superfamily exerts biological effects including modulation gabaa receptor function activation second-messenger signalling cascades g proteins show gabaa-ligand-gated channels complex selectively d5 receptors direct binding d5 carboxy-terminal domain second intracellular loop gabaa gamma 2short receptor subunit physical association enables mutually inhibitory functional interactions receptor systems data highlight previously unknown signal transduction mechanism whereby subtype-selective g-protein-coupled receptors dynamically regulate synaptic strength independently classically defined second-messenger systems provide heuristic framework view receptor systems maintenance psychomotor disease states
