experimental demonstration five-photon entanglement open-destination teleportation
quantum-mechanical entanglement three four particles achieved experimentally used demonstrate extreme contradiction quantum mechanics local realism however realization five-particle entanglement remains experimental challenge ability manipulate entanglement five particles required universal quantum error correction another key process distributed quantum information processing similar encoding decoding teleportation protocol term open-destination teleportation unknown quantum state single particle teleported onto superposition n particles later stage teleported state can read applications n particles projection measurement remaining particles report proof-of-principle demonstration five-photon entanglement open-destination teleportation n experiment use two entangled photon pairs generate four-photon entangled state combined single-photon state experimental methods can used investigations measurement-based quantum computation multi-party quantum communication
