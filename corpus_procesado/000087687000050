designing small-molecule switches protein-protein interactions 
mutations introduced human growth hormone hgh thr175 -> gly-hgh extracellular domain hgh receptor trp104 -> gly-hghbp created cavity protein-protein interface resulted binding affinity reduced factor small library indole analogs screened small molecules bind cavity created mutations restore binding affinity ligand -chloro--trichloromethylimidazole found increase affinity mutant hormone receptor -fold cell proliferation jak2 phosphorylation assays showed mutant hgh activates growth hormone signaling presence added ligand approach may allow protein-protein protein-nucleic acid interactions switched addition depletion exogenous small molecules
