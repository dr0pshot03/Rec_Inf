folding dna create nanoscale shapes patterns 
bottom fabrication exploits intrinsic properties atoms molecules direct self organization widely used make relatively simple nanostructures key goal approach create nanostructures high complexity matching routinely achieved top methods self assembly dna molecules provides attractive route towards goal describe simple method folding long single stranded dna molecules arbitrary two dimensional shapes design desired shape made raster filling shape kilobase single stranded scaffold choosing short oligonucleotide staple strands hold scaffold place synthesized mixed staple scaffold strands self assemble single step resulting dna structures roughly nm diameter approximate desired shapes squares disks five pointed stars spatial resolution nm oligonucleotide can serve nm pixel structures can programmed bear complex patterns words images surfaces finally individual dna structures can programmed form larger assemblies including extended periodic lattices hexamer triangles constitutes megadalton molecular complex
