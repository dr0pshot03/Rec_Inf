regulation cell cycle progression gene expression h2a deubiquitination 
post-translational histone modifications important regulatory roles chromatin structure function- one example modifications histone ubiquitination occurs predominately histone h2a h2b although recent identification ubiquitin ligase histone h2a revealed important roles h2a ubiquitination hox gene silencing- well x-chromosome inactivation enzymes involved h2a deubiquitination function h2a deubiquitination known report identification functional characterization major deubiquitinase histone h2a ubp-m also called usp16 ubp-m prefers nucleosomal substrates vitro specifically deubiquitinates histone h2a h2b vitro vivo notably knockdown ubp-m hela cells results slow cell growth rates owing defects mitotic phase cell cycle studies reveal h2a deubiquitination ubp-m prerequisite subsequent phosphorylation ser h3 chromosome segregation cells enter mitosis furthermore demonstrate ubp-m regulates hox gene expression h2a deubiquitination blocking function ubp-m results defective posterior development xenopus laevis study identifies major deubiquitinase histone h2a demonstrates h2a deubiquitination critically involved cell cycle progression gene expression
