direct mapping nuclear shell effects heaviest elements 
quantum-mechanical shell effects expected strongly enhance nuclear binding "island stability" superheavy elements predicted center proton number z neutron number n substantiated recent synthesis new elements z however location center extension island stability remain vague high-precision mass spectrometry allows direct measurement nuclear binding energies thus determination strength shell effects present measurements nobelium lawrencium isotopes also pin deformed shell gap n
