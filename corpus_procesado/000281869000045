differential arginylation actin isoforms regulated coding sequence-dependent degradation 
mammalian cytoskeletal proteins beta gamma-actin highly homologous beta-actin amino-terminally arginylated vivo regulates function examined metabolic fate exogenously expressed arginylated nonarginylated actin isoforms arginylated gamma-actin unlike beta- highly unstable selectively ubiquitinated degraded vivo instability regulated differences nucleotide coding sequence two actin isoforms conferred different translation rates gamma-actin translated slowly beta-actin slower processing resulted exposure normally hidden lysine residue ubiquitination leading preferential degradation gamma-actin upon arginylation degradation mechanism coupled nucleotide coding sequence may regulate protein arginylation vivo
