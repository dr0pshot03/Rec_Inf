interactive reference framework modeling dynamic immune system 
immune cells function interacting hierarchy coordinates activities various cell types according genetic environmental contexts developed graphical approaches construct extensible immune reference map mass cytometry data cells different organs incorporating landmark cell populations flags map compare cells distinct samples maps recapitulated canonical cellular phenotypes revealed reproducible tissue-specific deviations approach revealed influences genetic variation circadian rhythms immune system structure enabled direct comparisons murine human blood cell phenotypes even enabled archival fluorescence-based flow cytometry data mapped onto reference framework foundational reference map provides working definition systemic immune organization new data can integrated reveal deviations driven genetics environment pathology
