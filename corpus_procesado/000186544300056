nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs can lower amyloidogenic beta42 inhibiting rho 
subset nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs nsaids shown preferentially reduce secretion highly amyloidogenic -residue amyloid-beta peptide abeta42 found rho effector rho-associated kinase preferentially regulated amount abeta42 produced vitro nsaids effective rho inhibitors lowered abeta42 administration y- selective rock inhibitor also preferentially lowered brain levels abeta42 transgenic mouse model alzheimers disease thus rho-rock pathway may regulate amyloid precursor protein processing subset nsaids can reduce abeta42 inhibition rho activity
