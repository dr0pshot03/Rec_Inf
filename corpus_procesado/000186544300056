nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs can lower amyloidogenic beta inhibiting rho 
subset nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs nsaids shown preferentially reduce secretion highly amyloidogenic residue amyloid-beta peptide abeta found rho effector rho-associated kinase preferentially regulated amount abeta produced vitro nsaids effective rho inhibitors lowered abeta administration y- selective rock inhibitor also preferentially lowered brain levels abeta transgenic mouse model alzheimers disease thus rho-rock pathway may regulate amyloid precursor protein processing subset nsaids can reduce abeta inhibition rho activity
