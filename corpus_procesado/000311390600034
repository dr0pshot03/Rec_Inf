protein-folding problem years 
protein-folding problem first posed one half-century ago term refers three broad questions: physical code amino acid sequence dictates proteins native structure ii can proteins fold fast iii can devise computer algorithm predict protein structures sequences review progress problems cases computer simulations physical forces chemically detailed models now achieved accurate folding small proteins learned proteins fold rapidly random thermal motions cause conformational changes leading energetically downhill toward native structure principle captured funnel-shaped energy landscapes thanks part large protein data bank known structures predicting protein structures now far successful thought possible early days began three questions basic science one half-century ago now grown full-fledged research field protein physical science
