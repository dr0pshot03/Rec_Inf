cryptochrome mediates light-dependent magnetosensitivity drosophila 
although many animals use earths magnetic field orientation navigation precise biophysical mechanisms underlying magnetic sensing elusive one theoretical model proposes geomagnetic fields perceived chemical reactions involving specialized photoreceptors however specific photoreceptor involved magnetoreception demonstrated conclusively animal show ultraviolet-a/blue-light photoreceptor cryptochrome cry necessary light dependent magnetosensitive responses drosophila melanogaster binary choice behavioural assay magnetosensitivity wild type flies show significant naive trained responses magnetic field full spectrum light similar nm respond field wavelengths cry sensitive ultraviolet a/ blue light part spectrum < nm blocked notably cry deficient cry cryb flies show either naive trained responses magnetic field full spectrum light moreover cry dependent magnetosensitivity require functioning circadian clock work provides knowledge first genetic evidence cry-based magnetosensitive system animal
