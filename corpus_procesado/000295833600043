flash heating leads low frictional strength crustal rocks earthquake slip rates 
sliding resistance faults earthquakes critical unknown earthquake physics friction coefficient rocks slow slip rates laboratory ranges consistent measurements high stresses earths crust demonstrate fast seismic slip rates extraordinary reduction friction coefficient crustal silicate rocks results intense flash heating microscopic asperity contacts resulting degradation shear strengths values friction coefficient due flash heating explain lack observed heat flow anomaly along active faults san andreas fault nearly pure velocity-weakening friction due flash heating explain earthquake ruptures propagate self-healing slip pulses
