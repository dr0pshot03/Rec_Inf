exosome-mediated recognition degradation mrnas lacking termination codon 
one role messenger rna mrna degradation maintain fidelity gene expression degrading aberrant transcripts recent results show mrnas without translation termination codons unstable eukaryotic cells used yeast mutants demonstrate "nonstop" mrnas; degraded exosome -to- direction degradation nonstop transcripts requires exosome-associated protein ski7p ski7p closely related translation elongation factor ef1a translation termination factor erf3 suggests recognition nonstop mrnas involves binding ski7p empty aminoacyl-rna-binding site site ribosome thereby bringing exosome mrna ribosome stalled near end system efficiently degrades mrnas prematurely polyadenylated within coding region prevents expression
