microbiota-liberated host sugars facilitate post-antibiotic expansion enteric pathogens 
human intestine colonized dense community resident microbes frequent target bacterial pathogens undisturbed intestinal microbiota provides protection bacterial infections conversely disruption microbiota oral antibiotics often precedes emergence several enteric pathogens- pathogens capitalize upon failure microbiota-afforded protection largely unknown show two antibiotic-associated pathogens salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium s typhimurium clostridium difficile use common strategy catabolizing microbiota-liberated mucosal carbohydrates expansion within gut s typhimurium accesses fucose sialic acid within lumen gut microbiota-dependent manner genetic ablation respective catabolic pathways reduces competitiveness vivo similarly c difficile expansion aided microbiota-induced elevation sialic acid levels vivo colonization gnotobiotic mice sialidase-deficient mutant bacteroides thetaiotaomicron model gut symbiont reduces free sialic acid levels resulting c difficile downregulating sialic acid catabolic pathway exhibiting impaired expansion effects reversed exogenous dietary administration free sialic acid furthermore antibiotic treatment conventional mice induces spike free sialic acid mutants salmonella c difficile unable catabolize sialic acid exhibit impaired expansion data show antibiotic-induced disruption resident microbiota subsequent alteration mucosal carbohydrate availability exploited two distantly related enteric pathogens similar manner insight suggests new therapeutic approaches preventing diseases caused antibiotic-associated pathogens
