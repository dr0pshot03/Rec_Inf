tests general relativity timing double pulsar
double pulsar system psr j0737-3039a/b unique neutron stars detectable radio pulsars also known much higher mean orbital velocities accelerations binary pulsars system therefore good candidate testing einsteins theory general relativity alternative theories gravity strong-field regime report precision timing observations taken years since discovery present four independent strong-field tests general relativity tests use theory-independent mass ratio two stars measuring relativistic corrections keplerian description orbital motion find post-keplerian parameter s agrees value predicted general relativity within uncertainty % precise test yet obtained also show transverse velocity systems center mass extremely small combined systems location near sun result suggests future tests gravitational theories double pulsar will supersede best current solar system tests also implies second-born pulsar may formed core collapse helium star usually assumed
