logarithmic rate dependence force networks sheared granular materials 
many models slow dense granular flows- assume internal stresses independent shearing rate contrast logarithmic rate dependence found solid-on-solid friction- geological settings- elsewhere- investigate rate dependence stress slowly sheared two-dimensional system photoelastic disks able determine forces granular scale find mean time-averaged stress displays logarithmic dependence shear rate plastic irreversible deformations however perceivable dependence driving rate elastic reversible deformations occur moderate repetitive compression increasing shearing rate leads increase strength force network stress fluctuations qualitatively behaviour resembles changes associated increase density increases shearing rate also lead qualitative changes distributions stress build-up relaxation events shearing suddenly stopped stress relaxations occur logarithmic functional form long timescales slow collective relaxation stress network provides mechanism rate-dependent strengthening
