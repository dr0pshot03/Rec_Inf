species selection maintains self-incompatibility
identifying traits affect rates speciation extinction hence explain differences species diversity among clades major goal evolutionary biology detecting traits especially difficult undergo frequent transitions states self-incompatibility ability hermaphrodites enforce outcrossing frequently lost flowering plants enabling self-fertilization show however nightshade plant family solanaceae species functional self-incompatibility diversify significantly higher rate without apparent short-term advantages potentially self-fertilizing individuals therefore offset strong species selection favors obligate outcrossing
