broadband observations naked-eye gamma-ray burst grb 080319b
long duration gamma-ray bursts grbs release copious amounts energy across entire electromagnetic spectrum provide window process black hole formation collapse massive stars previous early optical observations even exceptional grbs lacked temporal resolution probe optical flash detail accuracy needed trace transition prompt emission within outflow external shocks caused interaction progenitor environment report observations extraordinarily bright prompt optical gamma-ray emission grb 080319b provide diagnostics within seconds formation followed broadband observations afterglow decay continued weeks show prompt emission stems single physical region implying extremely relativistic outflow propagates within narrow inner core two component jet
