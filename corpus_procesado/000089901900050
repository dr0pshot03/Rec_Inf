proteins linked genes evolve similar rates 
much variation rate protein evolution occurs expected chance proteins evolve rapidly others slowly poorly resolved proposed example essential genes might evolve slower dispensable ones case despite earlier claims rates evolution correlate amino-acid composition patterns found: proteins involved antagonistic coevolution example immune genes parasite antigens reproductive conflict genes- tend rapidly evolving correlation rate protein evolution mutation rate gene report new highly statistically significant predictor proteins rate evolution show linked genes similar rates protein evolution also weaker similarity rates silent site evolution see ref appears part consequence similarity rates protein evolution similarity rates protein evolution consequence underlying mutational patterns pronounced negative correlation rate protein evolution covariant recombination rate indicates rates protein evolution possibly reflect part local strength stabilizing selection
