differential lysosomal proteolysis antigen-presenting cers determines antigen fate 
antigen-presenting cells apcs internalize antigens present antigen-derived peptides t cells although apcs thought exhibit well-developed capacity lysosomal proteolysis found can exhibit two distinct strategies upon antigen encounter whereas macrophages contained high levels lysosomal proteases rapidly degraded internalized proteins dendritic cells dcs b lymphocytes protease-poor resulting limited capacity lysosomal degradation consistent findings dcs vivo degraded internalized antigens slowly thus retained antigen lymphoid organs extended periods limited lysosomal proteolysis also favored antigen presentation results help explain dcs able efficiently accumulate process disseminate antigens microbes systemically purposes tolerance immunity
