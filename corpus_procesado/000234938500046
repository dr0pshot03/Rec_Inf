molecular framework plant regeneration 
plants animals profound capacity regenerate organs adult tissues molecular mechanisms regeneration however largely unexplored investigate local regeneration response arabidopsis roots laser-induced wounding disrupts flow auxin-a cell-fate-instructive plant hormone-in root tips demonstrate resulting cell-fate changes require plethora shortroot scarecrow transcription factors transcription factors regulate expression polar position pin auxin efflux-facilitating membrane proteins reconstitute auxin transport renewed root tips thus regeneration mechanism using embryonic root stem-cell patterning factors first responds subsequently stabilizes new hormone distribution
