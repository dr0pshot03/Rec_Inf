structure function human tafii double bromodomain module 
tfiid large multiprotein complex initiates assembly transcription machinery unclear tfiid recognizes promoters vivo templates nucleosome-bound shown tafii largest subunit tfiid contains two tandem bromodomain modules bind selectively multiply acetylated histone h4 peptides angstrom crystal structure double bromodomain reveals two side-by-side four-helix bundles highly polarized surface charge distribution bundle contains n-epsilon-acetyllysine binding pocket center results structure ideally suited recognition diacetylated histone h4 tails thus tfiid may targeted specific chromatin-bound promoters may play role chromatin recognition
