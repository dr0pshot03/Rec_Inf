red queen drives terrestrial mammals extinction 
species disappear processes background extinction yet processes poorly understood analyzed evolutionary dynamics cenozoic terrestrial mammalian clades rich fossil records now fully extinct diversity decline find diversity loss just consequence gamblers ruin resulted evolutionary loss red queen failure keep pace deteriorating environment diversity loss driven equally depressed origination rates elevated extinction rates although find diversity-dependent origination extinction rates diversity clade transiently equaled implied equilibrium diversity thus processes drove diversity loss terrestrial mammal clades fundamentally nonequilibrial overwhelmed diversity-dependent processes
