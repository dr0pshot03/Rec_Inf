broadband ground-plane cloak 
possibility cloaking object detection electromagnetic waves recently become topic considerable interest design cloak uses transformation optics conformal coordinate transformation applied maxwells equations obtain spatially distributed set constitutive parameters define cloak present experimental realization cloak design conceals perturbation flat conducting plane object can hidden match complex spatial distribution required constitutive parameters constructed metamaterial consisting thousands elements geometry element determined automated design process ground-plane cloak can realized use nonresonant metamaterial elements resulting structure broad operational bandwidth covering range gigahertz experiment exhibiting extremely low loss experimental results indicate type cloak scale well toward optical wavelengths
