adaptive evolution drives divergence hybrid inviability gene two species drosophila 
speciation-the splitting one species two-occurs evolution several forms reproductive isolation taxa including intrinsic sterility inviability hybrids abundant evidence shows hybrid fitness problems caused incompatible interactions loci: new alleles become established one species sometimes functionally incompatible alleles interacting loci another species however almost nothing known genes involved hybrid incompatibilities evolutionary forces drive divergence identify gene causes epistatic inviability hybrids two fruitfly species drosophila melanogaster d simulans population genetic analysis reveals gene-which encodes nuclear pore protein-evolved positive natural selection species lineages results show lethal hybrid incompatibility evolved by-product adaptive protein evolution
