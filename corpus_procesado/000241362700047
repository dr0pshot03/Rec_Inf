experimental purification two-atom entanglement
entanglement necessary resource quantum applications entanglement established quantum systems different locations enables private communication quantum teleportation facilitates quantum information processing distributed entanglement established preparing entangled pair quantum particles one location transporting one member pair another location however decoherence transport reduces quality fidelity entanglement protocol achieve entanglement purification proposed improve fidelity transport protocol uses separate quantum operations location classical communication distil high-fidelity entangled pairs lower-fidelity pairs proof-of-principle experiments distilling entangled photon pairs carried out- however experiments obtained distilled pairs low probability success required destruction entangled pairs rendering unavailable processing report efficient non-destructive entanglement purification atomic quantum bits two noisy entangled pairs created distilled one higher-fidelity pair available use success probabilities per cent many applications entanglement purification make one important techniques quantum information processing
