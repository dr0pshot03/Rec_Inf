limb regeneration adult tissue converted zone undifferentiated progenitors called blastema reforms diverse tissues limb previous experiments led wide acceptance limb tissues dedifferentiate form pluripotent cells reexamined question using integrated gfp transgene track major limb tissues limb regeneration salamander ambystoma mexicanum axolotl surprisingly find tissue produces progenitor cells restricted potential therefore blastema heterogeneous collection restricted progenitor cells basis findings demonstrate positional identity cell-type-specific property blastema cells cartilage-derived blastema cells harbour positional identity schwann-derived cells results show complex phenomenon limb regeneration can achieved without complete dedifferentiation pluripotent state conclusion important implications regenerative medicine
