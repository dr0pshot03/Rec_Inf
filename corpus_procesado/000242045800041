solar wind neon genesis: implications lunar noble gas record
lunar soils thought contain two solar noble gas components distinct isotopic composition one identified implanted solar wind higher-energy solar particles latter puzzling relative amounts much large compared present-day fluxes suggesting periodic high solar activity past show depth-dependent isotopic composition neon metallic glass exposed nasas genesis mission agrees expected depth profile solar wind neon uniform isotopic composition results strongly indicate extra high-energy component required solar neon isotope composition lunar samples can explained implantation-fractionated solar wind
