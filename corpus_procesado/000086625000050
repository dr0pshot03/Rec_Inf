role nf-kappa b p53-mediated programmed cell death 
tumour suppressor p53 inhibits cell growth activation cell-cycle arrest apoptosis cancers either mutation within p53 gene defects ability induce p53 activation re-introduction p53 induces apoptosis many tumour cells may provide effective cancer therapy one key proteins modulates apoptotic response nf-kappa b transcription factor can protect contribute apoptosis show induction p53 causes activation nf-kappa b correlates ability p53 induce apoptosis inhibition loss nf-kappa b activity abrogated p53-induced apoptosis indicating nf-kappa b essential p53-mediated cell death activation nf-kappa b p53 distinct mediated tumour-necrosis factor-alpha involved mek1 activation pp90rsk inhibition mek1 blocked activation nf-kappa b p53 completely abrogated p53-induced cell death conclude inhibition nf-kappa b tumours retain wild-type p53 may diminish rather augment therapeutic response
