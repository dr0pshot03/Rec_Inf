cell movements hensens node establish left/right asymmetric gene expression chick 
vertebrates readily apparent left/right l/r anatomical asymmetries internal organs can traced molecular events initiated near time gastrulation however earliest steps process seem universally conserved particular axis first defined chicks remained problematic show asymmetric cell rearrangements take place within chick embryos creating leftward movement cells around node relative displacement cells expressing sonic hedgehog shh fibroblast growth factor fgf8 responsible establishing asymmetric expression patterns creation asymmetric expression domains passive effect cell movements represents alternative strategy breaking l/r symmetry gene activity
