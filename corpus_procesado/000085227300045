rapid diffusive infiltration sodium partially molten peridotite 
recent seismological geochemical experimental observations suggest mantle peridotite melts resulting basaltic liquid forms interconnected network culminating rapid ascent basalt relative surrounding solid matrix- mantle melting therefore polybaric process melts produced range pressures differing chemical characteristics- modelling peridotite-melting experiments designed simulate polybaric mantle melting generally assume interaction melts generated greater pressures overlying solid mantle lower pressures beneath mid-ocean ridges melts derived greater depth probably channelized ascent preventing direct re-equilibration shallow peridotites required geochemical observations show however sodium ascending melts will quickly diffuse melt formed within nearby peridotite lower pressures process fundamentally changes manner peridotite melts can account creation silica-rich glass inclusions mantle xenoliths anomalous melting modes recorded abyssal peridotites increased melting lithosphere upwelling asthenosphere result process without need invoke higher mantle temperatures
