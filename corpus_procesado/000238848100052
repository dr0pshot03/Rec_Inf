spin-wave lifetimes throughout brillouin zone
used neutron spin-echo method microelectron-volt resolution determine lifetimes spin waves prototypical antiferromagnet mnf2 entire brillouin zone theory based interaction spin waves magnons longitudinal spin fluctuations provides excellent parameter-free description data except lowest momenta temperatures surprising given prominence alternative theories based magnon-magnon interactions literature results technique open new avenue investigation fundamental concepts magnetism technique also allows measurement lifetimes elementary excitations lattice vibrations throughout brillouin zone
