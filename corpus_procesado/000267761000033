adaptive prediction environmental changes microorganisms 
natural habitats microorganisms may fluctuate erratically whereas others predictable offer opportunity prepare advance next environmental change analogy classical pavlovian conditioning microorganisms may evolved anticipate environmental stimuli adapting temporal order appearance present evidence environmental change anticipation two model microorganisms escherichia coli saccharomyces cerevisiae show anticipation adaptive trait pre-exposure stimulus typically appears early ecology improves organisms fitness encountered second stimulus additionally observe loss conditioned response e coli strains repeatedly exposed laboratory evolution experiment first stimulus focusing molecular level reveals natural temporal order stimuli embedded wiring regulatory network-early stimuli pre-induce genes needed later ones yet later stimuli induce genes needed cope work indicates environmental anticipation adaptive trait repeatedly selected evolution thus may ubiquitous biology
