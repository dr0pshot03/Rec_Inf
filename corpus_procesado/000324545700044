germline mitochondrial dna mutations aggravate ageing can impair brain development 
ageing due accumulation various types damage mitochondrial dysfunction long considered important process- substantial sequence variation mammalian mitochondrial dna mtdna high mutation rate counteracted different mechanisms decrease maternal transmission mutated mtdna- despite protective mechanisms becoming increasingly clear lowlevel mtdna heteroplasmy quite common often inherited humans designed series mouse mutants investigate extent inherited mtdna mutations can contribute ageing report maternally transmitted mtdna mutations can induce mild ageing phenotypes mice wild-type nuclear genome furthermore maternally transmittedmtdnamutations lead anticipation reduced fertility mice heterozygous themtdnamutator allele polgawt/mut aggravate premature ageing phenotypes inmtdnamutatormice polgamut/mut unexpectedly combination maternally transmitted somatic mtdna mutations also leads stochastic brain malformations findings show pre-existing mutation load will allow somatic mutagenesis create critically high total mtdna mutation load sooner will also increase clonal expansionofmtdna mutations enhance normally occurring mosaic respiratory chain deficiency ageing tissues findings suggest maternally transmitted mtdna mutations may similar role aggravating aspects normal human ageing
