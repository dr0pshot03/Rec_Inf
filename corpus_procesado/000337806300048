metformin suppresses gluconeogenesis inhibiting mitochondrial glycerophosphate dehydrogenase 
metformin considered one effective therapeutics treating type diabetes specifically reduces hepatic gluconeogenesis without increasing insulin secretion inducing weight gain posing risk hypoglycaemia half century agent prescribed patients type diabetes world wide yet underlying mechanism metformin inhibits hepatic gluconeogenesis remains unknown show metformin non-competitively inhibits redox shuttle enzyme mitochondrial glycerophosphate dehydrogenase resulting altered hepatocellular redox state reduced conversion lactate glycerol glucose decreased hepatic gluconeogenesis acute chronic low-dose metformin treatment effectively reduced endogenous glucose production increasing cytosolic redox decreasing mitochondrial redox states antisense oligonucleotide knockdown hepatic mitochondrial glycerophosphate dehydrogenase rats resulted phenotype akin chronic metformin treatment abrogated metformin-mediated increases cytosolic redox state decreases plasma glucose concentrations inhibition endogenous glucose production findings replicated whole-body mitochondrial glycerophosphate dehydrogenase knockout mice results significant implications understanding mechanism metformins blood glucose lowering effects provide new therapeutic target type diabetes
