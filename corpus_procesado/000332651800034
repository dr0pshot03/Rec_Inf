interrogating selectivity catalysis using molecular vibrations 
delineation molecular properties underlie reactivity selectivity core physical organic chemistry- knowledge can used inform design improved synthetic methods identify new chemical transformations- reason mathematical representation properties affecting reactivity selectivity trends molecular parameters paramount correlations produced equating molecular parameters experimental outcomes often defined free-energy relationships can used evaluate origin selectivity generate new experimentally testable hypotheses- premise behind successful correlations type systematically perturbed molecular property affects transition-state interaction catalyst substrate reaction components involved determination selectivity classic physical organic molecular descriptors hammett taft charton parameters seek independently probe isolated electronic steric effects- however parameters address simultaneous non-additive variations one molecular property limits utility report parameter system based vibrational response molecule infrared radiation can used mathematically model predict selectivity trends reactions interlinked steric electronic effects positions interest disclosed parameter system mechanistically derived find broad use study chemical biological systems
