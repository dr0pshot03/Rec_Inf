rapid collisional evolution comets formation oort cloud
oort cloud comets formed ejection icy planetesimals region giant planets-jupiter saturn uranus neptune-during formation dynamical simulations previously shown comets reach oort cloud perturbed eccentric orbits result close encounters giant planets eject distant orbits au sun au average earth-sun distance oort cloud models constructed now simulate formation using gravitational effects include influence sun planets external perturbers passing stars galactic tides show physical collisions comets small debris play fundamental hitherto unexplored role throughout ejection process standard models protosolar nebula starting minimum-mass nebula rnd collisional evolution comets severe erosional lifetimes much shorter timescale dynamical ejection therefore appears collisions will prevent comets escaping locations region giant planets disk mass declines sufficiently dynamical ejection timescale shorter collisional lifetime one consequence total mass comets oort cloud may less currently believed
