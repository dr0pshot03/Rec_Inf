bond-controlled configurational entropy reduction chemical vitrification 
glass formation usually viewed terms physical vitrification: liquid metastable state1 cooled compressed avoid crystallization however glasses may also formed chemical vitrification process involving progressive polymerization constituent molecules via formation irreversible chemical bonds formation materials used engineering plastics hardening natural synthetic resins based chemical vitrification despite differences molecular processes involved chemical physical vitrification surprising similarities2- observed slowing dynamics thermodynamical properties resulting glasses explaining similarities improve general understanding glass transition may disclose universal nature report dielectric photon-correlation measurements reveal origin similarity dynamical behaviour physical chemical glass formers find evolution configurational restrictions proceeds similar manner particular make connection reduction configurational entropy number chemical bonds quantity can controlled experiments
