electronic nematicity structural superconducting transition bafe2as1-xpx 
electronic nematicity unidirectional self-organized state breaks rotational symmetry underlying lattice observed iron pnictide- copper oxide- high-temperature superconductors whether nematicity plays equally important role two systems highly controversial iron pnictides nematicity usually associated tetragonal-to-orthorhombic structural transition temperature t-s although recent experiments- provided hints nematicity performed either low-temperature orthorhombic phase tetragonal phase uniaxial strain break degrees rotational c symmetry therefore question remains open whether nematicity can exist t-s without external driving force report magnetic torque measurements isovalent-doping system bafe2as1-xpx showing nematicity develops well t-s moreover persists non-magnetic superconducting regime resulting phase diagram similar pseudogap phase diagram copper oxides combining results synchrotron x-ray measurements identify two distinct temperatures-one t* signifying true nematic transition t-s <t* show true phase transition rather refer meta-nematic transition analogy well-known meta-magnetic transition theory magnetism
