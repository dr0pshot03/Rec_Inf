persistent lcmv infection controlled blockade type interferon signaling
persistent viral infections chronic immune activation negative immune regulator expression elevated interferon signature lymphoid tissue destruction correlate disease progression demonstrated blockade type interferon ifn-i signaling using ifn-i receptor neutralizing antibody reduced immune system activation decreased expression negative immune regulatory molecules restored lymphoid architecture mice persistently infected lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus ifn-i blockade establishment persistent virus infection resulted enhanced virus clearance cd4 t cell-dependent hence demonstrate direct causal link ifn-i signaling immune activation negative immune regulator expression lymphoid tissue disorganization virus persistence results suggest therapies targeting ifn-i may help control persistent virus infections
