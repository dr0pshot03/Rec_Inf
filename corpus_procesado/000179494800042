truncating neurotrypsin mutation autosomal recessive nonsyndromic mental retardation
base pair deletion neuronal serine protease neurotrypsin gene associated autosomal recessive nonsyndromic mental retardation mr situ hybridization experiments human fetal brains showed neurotrypsin highly expressed brain structures involved learning memory immunoelectron microscopy adult human brain sections revealed neurotrypsin located presynaptic nerve endings particularly presynaptic membrane lining synaptic cleft findings suggest neurotrypsin-mediated proteolysis required normal synaptic function suggest potential insights pathophysiological bases mental retardation
