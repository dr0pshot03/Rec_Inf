genetic evidence relative synaptic efficacy biases outcome synaptic competition 
synaptic activity drives synaptic rearrangement vertebrate nervous system indeed appears main way experience shapes neural connectivity one rearrangement occurs many parts nervous system early postnatal life competitive process called synapse elimination neuromuscular junction synapse elimination analysed detail muscle fibres initially innervated multiple axons one withdrawn winner enlarges- support idea synapse elimination activity dependent slowed speeded total neuromuscular activity decreased increased respectively- however hypotheses synaptic rearrangement postulate change depends less total activity relative activity competitors- intuitively seems input best able excite postsynaptic target likely win competition theories results make predictions- use genetic method selectively inhibit neurotransmission one two inputs single target cell show powerful inputs strongly favoured competitors synapse elimination
