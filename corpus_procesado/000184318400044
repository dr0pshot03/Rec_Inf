genetic evidence relative synaptic efficacy biases outcome synaptic competition 
synaptic activity drives synaptic rearrangement vertebrate nervous system; indeed appears main way experience shapes neural connectivity12 one rearrangement occurs many parts nervous system early postnatal life competitive process called synapse elimination34 neuromuscular junction synapse elimination analysed detail muscle fibres initially innervated multiple axons one withdrawn winner enlarges4- support idea synapse elimination activity dependent slowed speeded total neuromuscular activity decreased increased respectively47- however hypotheses synaptic rearrangement postulate change depends less total activity relative activity competitors1- intuitively seems input best able excite postsynaptic target likely win competition theories results make predictions14- use genetic method selectively inhibit neurotransmission one two inputs single target cell show powerful inputs strongly favoured competitors synapse elimination
