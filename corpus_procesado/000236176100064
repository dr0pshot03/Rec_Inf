ion selectivity one basic properties define ion channel tetrameric cation channels include k+ ca2+ na+ cyclic nucleotide-gated channels probably share similar overall architecture ion-conduction pore structural details determine ion selection different although k+ channel selectivity well studied structural perspective12 little known structure cation channels present crystal structures nak channel bacillus cereus non-selective tetrameric cation channel na+ k+-bound states angstrom angstrom resolution respectively nak channel shares high sequence homology similar overall structure bacterial kcsa k+ channel selectivity filter adopts different architecture unlike k+ channel selectivity filter contains four equivalent k+-binding sites selectivity filter nak channel preserves two cation-binding sites equivalent sites k+ channel whereas region corresponding sites k+ channel becomes vestibule ions can diffuse bind specifically functional analysis using rb- flux assay shows nak channel can conduct na+ k+ ions conclude sequence nak selectivity filter resembles cyclic nucleotide-gated channel structure may represent cyclic nucleotide-gated channel pore
