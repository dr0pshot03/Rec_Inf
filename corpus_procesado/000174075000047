functional neurogenesis adult hippocampus 
extensive evidence indicating new neurons generated dentate gyrus adult mammalian hippocampus region brain important learning memory1- however known whether new neurons become functional methods used study adult neurogenesis limited fixed tissue use retroviral vector expressing green fluorescent protein labels dividing cells can visualized live hippocampal slices report newly generated cells adult mouse hippocampus neuronal morphology can display passive membrane properties action potentials functional synaptic inputs similar found mature dentate granule cells findings demonstrate newly generated cells mature functional neurons adult mammalian brain
