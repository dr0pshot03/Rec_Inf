evolutionary origin complex features 
long-standing challenge evolutionary theory whether can explain origin complex organismal features examined issue using digital organisms-computer programs self-replicate mutate compete evolve populations digital organisms often evolved ability perform complex logic functions requiring coordinated execution many genomic instructions complex functions evolved building simpler functions evolved earlier provided also selectively favoured however particular intermediate stage essential evolving complex functions first genotypes able perform complex functions differed non-performing parents one two mutations differed ancestor many mutations also crucial new functions cases mutations deleterious appeared served stepping-stones evolution complex features findings show complex functions can originate random mutation natural selection
