slow electron cooling colloidal quantum dots
hot electrons semiconductors lose energy quickly within picoseconds lattice vibrations slowing energy loss prove useful efficient photovoltaic infrared devices well separated electronic states quantum dots display slow relaxation mechanisms made difficult observe report slow intraband relaxation > nanosecond colloidal quantum dots small cadmium selenide cdse dots intraband energy separation similar electron volts capped epitaxial zinc selenide znse shell shell terminated cdse passivating layer remove electron traps covered ligands low infrared absorbance alkane thiols intraband energy found relaxation markedly slowed increasing znse shell thickness
