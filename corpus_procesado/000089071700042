quantum state-resolved insertion reaction: od-+h-jo > ohpi v n+hs-
od- + h -> oh + h reaction proceeds mainly insertion reaction collisional energy kilocalories per mole investigated high-resolution h atom rydberg tagging time-of-flight technique quasiclassical trajectory qct method quantum state-resolved differential cross sections measured prototype reaction different rotationally-vibrationally excited oh products markedly different angular distributions whereas total reaction products roughly forward backward symmetric theoretical results obtained qct calculations indicate reaction dominated insertion mechanism small contribution collinear abstraction mechanism quantum tunneling
