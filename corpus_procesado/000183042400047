modular pip2 binding site determinant capsaicin receptor sensitivity
capsaicin receptor trpv1 heat-activated ion channel pain pathway sensitized phosphatidylinositol--bisphosphate pip2 hydrolysis phospholipase c activation identify site within c-terminal domain trpv1 required pip2-mediated inhibition channel gating mutations weaken pip2-trpv1 interaction reduce thresholds chemical thermal stimuli whereas trpv1 channels region replaced lipid-bindingdomain pip2-activated potassium channels remain inhibited pip2 pip2-interaction domain therefore serves critical determinant thermal threshold dynamic sensitivity range tuning trpv1 thus sensory neuron appropriately detect heat normal pathophysiological conditions
