phylogenetic constraints adaptation explain food-web structure
food webs descriptions eats ecosystem although extremely complex variable structure possesses basic regularities- fascinating question find simple model capturing underlying processes behind repeatable patterns now two models devised description trophic interactions within natural community essentially based concept ecological niche consumers organized along single niche dimension example prey size unfortunately fail describe adequately recent high-quality data propose new model built hypothesis species diet consequence phylogenetic constraints adaptation simple rules incorporating concepts yield food webs whose structure close real data consumers organized groups forming nested hierarchy better reflects complexity multidimensionality natural systems
