rotary photon drag enhanced slow-light medium 
transmission spinning window slightly rotates polarization light typically microradian predicted mechanism also rotate image rotary photon drag contribution inversely proportional group velocity image rotation expected increase slow-light medium using ruby window conditions coherent population oscillations induced effective group index million resulting rotation angle large enough observed eye result shows rotary photon drag applies images well polarization possibility switching different rotation states may offer new opportunities controlled image coding
