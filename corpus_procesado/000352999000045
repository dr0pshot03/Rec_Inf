anthropogenic environmental changes affect ecosystem stability via biodiversity
human-driven environmental changes may simultaneously affect biodiversity productivity stability earths ecosystems consensus causal relationships linking variables data multiyear experiments manipulate important anthropogenic drivers including plant diversity nitrogen carbon dioxide fire herbivory water show driver influences ecosystem productivity however stability ecosystem productivity changed drivers alter biodiversity given decrease plant species numbers leading quantitatively similar decrease ecosystem stability regardless driver caused biodiversity loss results suggest changes biodiversity caused drivers environmental change may major factor determining global environmental changes affect ecosystem stability
