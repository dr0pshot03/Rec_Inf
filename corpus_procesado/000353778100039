mechanistic origins bombardier beetle brachinini explosion-induced defensive spray pulsation
bombardier beetles brachinini use rapid series discrete explosions inside pygidial gland reaction chambers produce hot pulsed quinone-based defensive spray mechanism brachinines spray pulsation explored using anatomical studies direct observation explosions inside living beetles using synchrotron x-ray imaging quantification dynamics vapor inside reaction chamber indicates spray pulsation controlled specialized contiguous cuticular structures located junction reservoir reactant reaction chambers kinematics models suggest passive mediation spray pulsation mechanical feedback explosion causing displacement structures
