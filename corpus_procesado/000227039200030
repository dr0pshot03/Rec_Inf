sleep affects developmental learning bird song 
sleep affects learning development humans animals role sleep developmental learning never examined show effects night-sleep song development zebra finch recording analysing entire song ontogeny periods rapid learning observed pronounced deterioration song structure night-sleep song regained structure intense morning singing daily improvement similarity tutored song occurred late phase morning recovery little improvement occurred thereafter furthermore birds showed stronger post-sleep deterioration development achieved better final imitation effect diminished age experiments showed oscillations result sleep inertia lack practice indicating possible involvement active process perhaps neural song-replay sleep suggest oscillations correspond competing demands plasticity consolidation learning creating repeated opportunities reshape previously learned motor skills
