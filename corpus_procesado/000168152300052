phototropin-related npl1 controls chloroplast relocation induced blue light 
photosynthetic cells chloroplasts migrate towards illuminated sites optimize photosynthesis move away excessively illuminated areas protect photosynthetic machinery1 although movement chloroplasts response light known century photoreceptor mediating process identified arabidopsis gene npl1 ref paralogue nph1 gene encodes phototropin photoreceptor phototropic bending3 show npl1 required chloroplast relocation induced blue light loss-of-function npl1 mutant showed chloroplast avoidance response strong blue light whereas accumulation chloroplasts weak light normal results indicate npl1 may function photoreceptor mediating chloroplast relocation
