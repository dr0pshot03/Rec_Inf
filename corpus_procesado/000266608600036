chaperonin overexpression promotes genetic variation enzyme evolution 
protein mutations mutations alter protein functions particular undermine stability therefore deleterious chaperones heat-shock proteins often implicated buffering mutations thus facilitate acquisition neutral genetic diversity rate adaptation examined ability escherichia coli groel/groes chaperonins buffer destabilizing adaptive mutations show mutational drifts performed vitro four different enzymes indicated groel/groes overexpression doubled number accumulating mutations promoted folding enzyme variants carrying mutations protein core and/or mutations higher destabilizing effects destabilization energies > kcal mol- average versus similar kcal mol- absence groel/groes divergence modified enzymatic specificity occurred much faster groel/groes overexpression terms number adapted variants > -fold improved specificity activity > -fold results indicate protein stability major constraint protein evolution buffering mechanisms chaperonins key alleviating constraint
