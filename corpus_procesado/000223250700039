simulations jets driven black hole rotation 
origin jets emitted black holes well understood; however two possible energy sources: accretion disk rotating black hole magnetohydrodynamic simulations show well-defined jet extracts energy black hole plasma near black hole threaded large-scale magnetic flux will rotate respect asymptotic infinity creating large magnetic stresses stresses released relativistic jet expense black hole rotational energy physics jet initiation simulations described theory black hole gravitohydromagnetics
