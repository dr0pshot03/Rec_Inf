flexible filaments flowing soap film model one-dimensional flags two-dimensional wind 
dynamics swimming fish flapping flags involves complicated interaction deformable shapes surrounding fluid flow even passive case flag flag exerts forces fluid inertia elastic responses likewise acted hydrodynamic pressure drag couplings well understood study interactions experimentally using analogous system flexible filaments flowing soap films rnd single filament flag held upstream end otherwise unconstrained two distinct stable dynamical states first stretched-straight state: filament immobile aligned flow direction existence state seems refute common belief flag always unstable will flap second flapping state: filament executes sinuous motion manner akin flapping flag wind study hydrodynamically coupled interaction two filaments demonstrate existence four different dynamical states
