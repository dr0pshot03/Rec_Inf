disparate individual fates compose robust cd8+ t cell immunity
core feature protective t cell responses infection robust expansion diversification naive antigen-specific t cell populations short-lived effector long-lived memory subsets means vivo fate mapping found striking variability immune responses derived individual cd8+ t cells show robust acute recall immunity requires initial recruitment multiple precursors unbiased mathematical modeling identifies random integration multiple differentiation division events driving force behind variability within probabilistic framework cell fate specified along linear developmental path progresses slowly proliferating long-lived rapidly expanding short-lived subsets data provide insights complex biological systems implement stochastic processes guarantee robust outcomes
