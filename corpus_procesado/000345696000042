host genetic diversity enables ebola hemorrhagic fever pathogenesis resistance
existing mouse models lethal ebola virus infection reproduce hallmark symptoms ebola hemorrhagic fever neither delayed blood coagulation disseminated intravascular coagulation death fromshock thus restricting pathogenesis studies nonhuman primates show mice collaborative cross panel recombinant inbred mice exhibit distinct disease phenotypes mouse-adapted ebola virus infection phenotypes range complete resistance lethal disease severe hemorrhagic fever characterized prolonged coagulation times % mortality inflammatory signaling associated vascular permeability endothelial activation resistance lethal infection arose induction lymphocyte differentiation cellular adhesion probably mediated susceptibility allele tek data indicate genetic background determines susceptibility ebola hemorrhagic fever
