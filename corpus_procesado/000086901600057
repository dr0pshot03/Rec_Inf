jnk required effector t-cell function t-cell activation
hallmark t-cell activation production interleukin il- c-jun amino-terminal kinase jnk map kinase phosphorylates c-jun components ap group transcription factors implicated activation il expression previously found t cells mice deficient jnk1 jnk2 gene can activated produce il normally deficient functional differentiation th1 th2 subsets however studies mice compound mutations indicate jnk1 jnk2 redundant mouse development use three new mouse models peripheral t cells completely lack jnk proteins signalling test whether jnk signalling pathway crucial il expression t-cell activation unexpectedly t cells made il proliferated better wild-type cells however production effector t-cell cytokines require jnk thus jnk necessary t-cell differentiation naive t-cell activation
