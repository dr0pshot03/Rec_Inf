prediction hydrogen flux sulfur-tolerant binary alloy membranes
metal membranes play vital rote hydrogen purification defect-free membranes can exhibit effectively infinite selectivity must also provide high fluxes resistance poisoning long operational lifetimes low cost alloying offers one route improve membranes based pure metals palladium show ab initio calculations coarse-grained modeling can accurately predict hydrogen fluxes binary alloy membranes functions alloy composition temperature pressure approach requires experimental input apart knowledge bulk crystal structures demonstrated palladium-copper alloys show nontrivial behavior due existence face-centered cubic body-centered cubic crystal structures potential resist sulfur poisoning accuracy approach examined comparison extensive experiments using thick foils elevated temperatures experiments also demonstrate ability membranes resist poisoning hydrogen sulfide
