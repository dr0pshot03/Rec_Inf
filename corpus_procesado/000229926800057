early asymmetry gene transcription embryonic human left right cerebral cortex
human left right cerebral hemispheres anatomically functionally asymmetric test whether human cortical asymmetry molecular basis studied gene expression levels left right embryonic hemispheres using serial analysis gene expression sage identified verified differentialty expressed genes suggests human cortical asymmetry accompanied early marked transcriptional asymmetries lmo4 consistently highly expressed right perisylvian human cerebral cortex left essential cortical development mice suggesting human left-right specialization reflects asymmetric cortical development early stages
