extensive remodeling cyanobacterial photosynthetic apparatus far-red light 
cyanobacteria unique among bacteria performing oxygenic photosynthesis often together nitrogen fixation thus major primary producers many ecosystems cyanobacterium leptolyngbya sp strain jsc- exhibits extensive photoacclimative response growth far-red light includes synthesis chlorophylls d f far-red acclimation transcript levels increase twofold similar genes decrease half similar genes core subunits photosystem photosystem ii phycobilisomes replaced proteins encoded gene cluster includes knotless red/far-red phytochrome two response regulators acclimative response enhances light harvesting wavelengths complementary growth light lambda nanometers enhances oxygen evolution far-red light
