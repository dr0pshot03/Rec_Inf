rapid soil production weathering southern alps new zealand
evaluating conflicting theories influence mountains carbon dioxide cycling climate requires understanding weathering fluxes tectonically uplifting landscapes lack soil production weathering rate measurements earths rapidly uplifting mountains made difficult determine whether weathering rates increase decline response rapid erosion beryllium concentrations soils western southern alps new zealand demonstrate soil produced bedrock rapidly previously recognized rates millimeters per year weathering intensity data indicate soil chemical denudation rates increase proportionally erosion rates high weathering rates support view mountains play key role global-scale chemical weathering thus potentially important implications global carbon cycle
