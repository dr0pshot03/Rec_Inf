creation manipulation three-dimensional optically trapped structures
interferometric pattern two annular laser beams used construct three-dimensional 3d trapped structures within optical tweezers setup addition fully translatable three dimensions trapped structure can rotated controllably continuously introducing frequency difference two laser beams interference patterns play important rote creation extended 3d crystalline structures
