genetics gene expression effect disease 
common human diseases result interplay many genes environmental factors therefore integrative biology approach needed unravel complexity causes diseases elucidate complexity common human diseases obesity analysed expression transcripts large population based blood adipose tissue cohorts comprehensively assessed various phenotypes including traits related clinical obesity contrast blood expression profiles observed marked correlation gene expression adipose tissue obesity related traits genome wide linkage association mapping revealed highly significant genetic component gene expression traits including strong genetic effect proximal cis signals % cis signals overlapping two tissues profiled demonstrate extensive transcriptional network constructed human adipose data exhibits significant overlap similar network modules constructed mouse adipose data core network module humans mice identified enriched genes involved inflammatory immune response found causally associated obesity related traits
