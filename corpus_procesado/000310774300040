integration chemical catalysis extractive fermentation produce fuels
nearly one hundred years ago fermentative production acetone clostridium acetobutylicum provided crucial alternative source solvent manufacture explosive cordite today resurgence interest solventogenic clostridium species produce n-butanol ethanol use renewable alternative transportation fuels- acetone product acetone-n-butanol-ethanol abe fermentation harbours nucleophilic alpha-carbon amenable c-c bond formation electrophilic alcohols produced abe fermentation functionality can used form higher-molecular-mass hydrocarbons similar found current jet diesel fuels describe integration biological chemocatalytic routes convert abe fermentation products efficiently ketones palladium-catalysed alkylation tuning reaction conditions permits production either petrol jet diesel precursors glyceryl tributyrate used situ selective extraction acetone alcohols enable simple integration abe fermentation chemical catalysis reducing energy demand overall process process provides means selectively produce petrol jet diesel blend stocks lignocellulosic cane sugars yields near theoretical maxima
