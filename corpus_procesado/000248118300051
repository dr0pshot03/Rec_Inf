conformational entropy molecular recognition proteins
molecular recognition proteins fundamental almost every biological process particularly protein associations underlying cellular signal transduction understanding basis protein-protein interactions requires full characterization thermodynamics association historically virtually impossible experimentally estimate changes protein conformational entropy potentially important component free energy protein association however nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy emerged powerful tool characterizing dynamics proteins employ changes conformational dynamics proxy corresponding changes conformational entropy find change internal dynamics protein calmodulin varies significantly binding variety target domains surprisingly apparent change corresponding conformational entropy linearly related change overall binding entropy indicates changes protein conformational entropy can contribute significantly free energy protein-ligand association
