membrane potential dynamics grid cells 
navigation grid cells increase spike rates firing fields arranged markedly regular triangular lattice whereas spike timing often modulated theta oscillations oscillatory interference models grid cells predict theta amplitude modulations membrane potential firing field traversals whereas competing attractor network models predict slow depolarizing ramps using vivo whole-cell recordings tested models directly measuring grid cell intracellular potentials mice running along linear tracks virtual reality grid cells large reproducible ramps membrane potential depolarization characteristic signature tightly correlated firing fields grid cells also demonstrated intracellular theta oscillations influenced spike timing however properties theta amplitude modulations consistent view determine firing field locations results support cellular network mechanisms grid fields produced slow ramps attractor models whereas theta oscillations control spike timing
