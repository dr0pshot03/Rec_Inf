catalytic activity caspase--flipl complex inhibits ripk3-dependent necrosis 
caspase- two opposing biological functions-it promotes cell death triggering extrinsic pathway apoptosis also survival activity required embryonic development1 t-lymphocyte activation2 resistance necrosis induced tumour necrosis factor-alpha tnf-alpha related family ligands34 show development caspase--deficient mice completely rescued ablation receptor interacting protein kinase- ripk3 adult animals lacking caspase- ripk3 display progressive lymphoaccumulative disease resembling seen defects cd95 cd95-ligand also known fas faslg respectively resist lethal effects cd95 ligation vivo found caspase- prevents ripk3-dependent necrosis without inducing apoptosis functioning proteolytically active complex flice-like inhibitory protein long flipl also known cflar complex required protective function
