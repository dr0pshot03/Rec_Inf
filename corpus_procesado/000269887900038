highly variable spread rates replicated biological invasions: fundamental limits predictability
although mean rates spread invasive species intensively studied variance spread rates neglected variance spread rates can driven exogenously environmental variability endogenously demographic genetic stochasticity reproduction survival dispersal endogenous variability likely important spread studied empirically show endogenously generated variance spread rates remarkably high replicated invasions flour beetle tribolium castaneum laboratory microcosms observed variation replicate invasions explained demographic stochasticity alone indicates inherent limitations predictability even simplest ecological settings
