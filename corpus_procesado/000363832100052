bacteriocin production augments niche competition enterococci mammalian gastrointestinal tract 
enterococcus faecalis common commensal human gastrointestinal tract leading cause hospital-acquired infections1 systemic infections multidrug-resistant enterococci occur subsequent gastrointestinal colonization2 preventing colonization multidrug-resistant e faecalis therefore valuable approach towards limiting infection however little known mechanisms e faecalis uses colonize compete stable gastrointestinal niches pheromone-responsive conjugative plasmids encoding bacteriocins common among enterococcal strains3 modulate niche competition among enterococci enterococci intestinal microbiota developed model colonization mouse gut e faecalis without disrupting microbiota evaluate role conjugative plasmid ppd1 expressing baderiocin ref enterococcal colonization show e faecalis harbouring ppd1 replaces indigenous enterococci outcompetes e faecalis lacking ppd1 furthermore intestine ppd1 transferred e faecalis strains conjugation enhancing survival colonization e faecalis strain carrying conjugation-defective ppd1 mutant subsequently resulted clearance vancomycin-resistant enterococci without plasmid transfer therefore bacteriocin expression commensal bacteria can influence niche competition gastrointestinal tract bacteriocins delivered commensals occupy precise intestinal bacterial niche may effective therapeutic approach specifically eliminate intestinal colonization multidrug-resistant bacteria without profound disruption indigenous microbiota
