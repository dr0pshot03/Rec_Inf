oligodendrocyte precursor cells reprogrammed become multipotential cns stem cells 
animal development cells become progressively restricted cell types can give rise central nervous system cns example multipotential stem cells produce various kinds specified precursors divide limited number times terminally differentiate either neurons glial cells show certain extracellular signals can induce oligodendrocyte precursor cells revert multipotential neural stem cells can self-renew give rise neurons astrocytes well oligodendrocytes thus precursor cells greater developmental potential previously thought
