lever-arm rotation drives motility minus-end-directed kinesin ncd 
kinesins microtubule-based motor proteins power intracellular transport12 kinesin motors exemplified kinesin- move towards microtubule plus end structural changes govern directional preference described3- contrast nature timing structural changes underlying minus-end-directed motility kinesin- motors drosophila ncd67 less well understood using cryo-electron microscopy demonstrate coiled-coil mechanical element microtubule-bound ncd rotates similar degrees towards minus end upon atp binding extending shortening coiled coil increases decreases velocity respectively without affecting atpase activity unusual ncd mutant lacks directional preference8 shows unstable nucleotide-dependent conformations coiled coil underscoring role mechanical element motility results show force-producing conformational change ncd occurs atp binding kinesins involves swing lever-arm mechanical element similar described myosins
