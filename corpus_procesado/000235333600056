lever-arm rotation drives motility minus-end-directed kinesin ncd
kinesins microtubule-based motor proteins power intracellular transport kinesin motors exemplified kinesin- move towards microtubule plus end structural changes govern directional preference described- contrast nature timing structural changes underlying minus-end-directed motility kinesin motors drosophila ncd less well understood using cryo-electron microscopy demonstrate coiled-coil mechanical element microtubule-bound ncd rotates similar degrees towards minus end upon atp binding extending shortening coiled coil increases decreases velocity respectively without affecting atpase activity unusual ncd mutant lacks directional preference shows unstable nucleotide-dependent conformations coiled coil underscoring role mechanical element motility results show force-producing conformational change ncd occurs atp binding kinesins involves swing lever-arm mechanical element similar described myosins
