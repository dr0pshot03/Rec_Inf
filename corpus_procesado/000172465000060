real-time single-molecule imaging infection pathway adeno-associated virus 
describe method based single-molecule imaging allows real-time visualization infection pathway single viruses living cells labeled one fluorescent dye molecule tracking single viruses removes ensemble averaging diffusion trajectories high spatial time resolution show various modes motion adeno-associated viruses aav infection pathway living hela cells: consecutive virus touching cell surface fast endocytosis; il free anomalous diffusion endosome virus cytoplasm nucleus; iii directed motion motor proteins cytoplasm nuclear tubular structures real-time visualization infection pathway single aavs shows much faster infection generally observed far
