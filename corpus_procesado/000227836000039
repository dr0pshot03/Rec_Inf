two episodes microbial change coupled permo/triassic faunal mass extinction
microbial expansion following faunal mass extinctions earth history can studied petrographic examination microbialites microbial crusts well-preserved organic-walled microbes however preservation poor quantification microbial communities can problematic circumvented problem adopting lipid biomarker-based approach evaluate microbial community changes across permo/triassic p/tr boundary meishan south china present biomarker stratigraphic record showing episodic microbial changes coupled high-resolution record invertebrate mass extinction variation microbial community structure characterized methylhopane -mhp index ratio abundance cyanobacterial biomarkers general bacterial biomarkers two episodes faunal mass extinction preceded minima mhp index followed strong maxima likely reflecting microbial responses catastrophic events caused extinction initiated ecosystem changes hence cyanobacterial biomarker invertebrate fossil records provide evidence two episodes biotic crisis across p/tr boundary
