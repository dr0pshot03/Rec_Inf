controlling photonic structures using optical forces
use optical forces manipulate small objects well known applications include manipulation living cells optical tweezers optical cooling atomic physics miniaturization optical systems micro nanoscale resulted compliant systems masses order nanograms rendering susceptible optical forces- optical forces exploited demonstrate chaotic quivering microcavities optical cooling mechanical modes- actuation tapered-fibre waveguide excitation mechanical modes silicon nano-beams despite recent progress field- challenging manipulate optical response photonic structures using optical forces large forces required induce appreciable changes geometry structure implement resonant structure whose optical response can efficiently statically controlled using relatively weak attractive repulsive optical forces demonstrate static mechanical deformation nanometres silicon nitride structure using three milliwatts continuous optical power sensitivity optical response deformation optically induced static displacement introduces resonance shifts spanning times intrinsic resonance linewidth
