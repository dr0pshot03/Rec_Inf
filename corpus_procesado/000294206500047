suppression coffee-ring effect shape-dependent capillary interactions 
drop liquid dries solid surface suspended particulate matter deposited ring-like fashion phenomenon known coffee-ring effect- familiar anyone observed drop coffee dry drying process drop edges become pinned substrate capillary flow outward centre drop brings suspended particles edge 
evaporation proceeds evaporation suspended particles left highly concentrated along original drop edge coffee-ring effect manifested systems diverse constituents ranging large colloids nanoparticles individual molecules fact-despite many practical applications uniform coatings printing biology complex assembly-the ubiquitous nature effect made difficult avoid- show experimentally shape suspended particles important can used eliminate coffee-ring effect: ellipsoidal particles deposited uniformly 
evaporation anisotropic shape particles significantly 
deforms interfaces producing strong interparticle apillary interactions- thus ellipsoids carried air-water interface outward flow causes coffee-ring 
effect spheres strong long-ranged interparticle attractions ellipsoids lead formation loosely packed arrested structures air-water interface structures prevent suspended particles reaching drop edge 
ensure uniform deposition interestingly appropriate 
conditions suspensions spheres mixed small number 
ellipsoids also produce uniform deposition thus particle shape 
provides convenient parameter control deposition particles without modification particle solvent chemistry
