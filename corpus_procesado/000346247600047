dust-parallax distance megaparsecs supermassive black hole ngc
active galaxy ngc crucial role one two active galactic nuclei black hole mass measurements based emission line reverberation mapping can calibrated dynamical techniques- unfortunately effective calibration requires accurate knowledge distance ngc present available recently reported distances range megaparsecs- strong peculiar motions make redshift-based distance uncertain geometry galaxy nucleus prohibit accurate measurements using techniques report dust-parallax distance ngc ++- megaparsecs measurement based adaptation geometric method uses emission line regions active galaxies regions small imaged present technology use instead ratio physical angular sizes extended hot-dust emission determined time delays infrared interferometry- distance leads approximately -fold increase dynamical black hole mass implying corresponding correction emission line reverberation masses black holes calibrated two objects additional dynamical masses
