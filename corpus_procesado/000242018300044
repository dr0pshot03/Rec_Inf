free-electron-like dispersion organic monolayer film metal substrate
thin films molecular organic semiconductors attracting much interest use electronic optoelectronic applications electronic properties materials interfaces therefore worth investigating intensively particularly degree electron delocalization can achieved delocalization appreciable accompanied observable electronic band dispersion far limited experimental data intermolecular dispersion electronic states molecular materials available mechanism s electron delocalization molecular materials also well understood report scanning tunnelling spectroscopy observations organic monolayer film silver substrate revealing completely delocalized two dimensional band state characterized metal like parabolic dispersion effective mass m* 47me bare electron mass dispersion far stronger expected organic film alone arises result strong substrate mediated coupling molecules within monolayer
