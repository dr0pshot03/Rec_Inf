interaction liquid water hydroxide revealed core-hole de-excitation 
hydroxide ion plays important role many chemical biochemical processes aqueous solution ourmolecular level understanding unusual fast transport water solvation patterns allow fast transport far complete one proposal seeks explain properties behaviour hydroxide ion essentially regarding water molecule missing proton inferring transport mechanisms hydration structures excess proton competing proposal invokes instead unique interchanging hydroxide hydration complexes particularly hypercoordinated oh-h2o species tri coordinated oh-h2o can form transient hydrogen bond h atom oh neighbouring water molecule- report measurements core level photoelectron emission intermolecular coulombic decay- aqueous hydroxide solution show hydrated hydroxide ion capable transiently donating hydrogen bond surrounding watermolecules agreement recent experimental studies hydroxide solutions- finding thus supports notion hydration structure hydroxide ion inferred hydrated excess proton
