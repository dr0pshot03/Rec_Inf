cosmic gamma-ray background structure formation intergalactic medium 
universe filled diffuse background gamma-ray radiation origin remains one unsolved puzzles cosmology less one-quarter gamma-ray flux can attributed unresolved discrete sources active galactic nuclei remainder appears constitute truly diffuse background show shock waves induced gravity gas intergalactic medium formation large-scale structures like filaments sheets galaxies produce population highly relativistic electrons electrons scatter small fraction cosmic microwave background photons local universe gamma-ray energies thereby providing gamma-ray background predicted diffuse flux agrees observed background across four orders magnitude photon energy model predicts gamma-ray background though generated locally isotropic better five per cent angular scales larger degree moreover agreement predicted observed background fluxes implies mean cosmological density baryons consistent big bang nucleosynthesis
