neural correlate response bias monkey caudate nucleus
primates equipped neural circuits prefrontal cortex- parietal cortex basal ganglia- predict availability reward performance behavioural tasks known however reward value incorporated control action identify neurons monkey caudate nucleus create spatially selective response bias depending expected gain behavioural tasks monkey make visually guided eye movement every trial rewarded correct response half trials reward availability predictable basis spatial position visual target found caudate neurons change discharge rate systematically even appearance visual target usually fire contralateral position associated reward strong anticipatory activity neurons contralateral preference associated decreased latency eye movements contralateral direction conclude neuronal mechanism creates advance bias favours spatial response associated high reward value
