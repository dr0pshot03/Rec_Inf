activation cytoplasmic dynein motility dynactin-cargo adapter complexes
cytoplasmic dynein molecular motor transports large variety cargoes e g organelles messenger rnas viruses along microtubules long intracellular distances dynactin protein complex important dynein activity vivo precise role unclear found purified mammalian dynein move processively microtubules vitro however dynein formed complex dynactin one four different cargo-specific adapter proteins motor became ultraprocessive moving distances similar native cargoes living cells thus propose dynein largely inactive cytoplasm variety adapter proteins activate processive motility linking dynactin dynein motor bound proper cargo
