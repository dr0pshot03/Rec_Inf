spring-loaded unraveling single snare complex nsf one round atp turnover 
intracellular membrane trafficking n-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor nsf alpha-soluble nsf attachment protein alpha-snap disassemble soluble nsf attachment protein receptor snare complex recycling snare proteins molecular mechanism nsf disassembles snare complex largely unknown using single-molecule fluorescence spectroscopy magnetic tweezers found nsf disassembled single snare complex one round adenosine triphosphate atp turnover upon atp cleavage nsf hexamer developed internal tension dissociation phosphate ions latent time measuring tens seconds nsf released built-up tension burst within milliseconds resulting disassembly followed immediate release snare proteins thus nsf appears use "spring-loaded" mechanism couple atp hydrolysis unfolding substrate proteins
