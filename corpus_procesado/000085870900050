simple rules yield complex food webs
several ambitious theories ecology- describe food webs document structure strong weak trophic links responsible ecological dynamics among diverse assemblages species- early mechanism-based theory asserted food webs little omnivory several properties independent species richness- theory overturned empirical studies found food webs much complex-- studies provide mechanistic explanations complexity show remarkably simple model fills scientific void successfully predicting key structural properties complex comprehensive food webs primary literature properties include fractions species top intermediate basal trophic levels means variabilities generality vulnerability food-chain length degrees cannibalism omnivory looping trophic similarity using two empirical parameters species number connectance niche model extends existing cascade model improves fit ten-fold constraining species consume contiguous sequence prey one-dimensional trophic niche
