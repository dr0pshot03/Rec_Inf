inferential structure determination 
macromolecular structures calculated nuclear magnetic resonance data fully determined experimental data depend subjective choices data treatment parameter settings makes difficult objectively judge precision structures used bayesian inference derive probability distribution represents unknown structure precision probability distribution also determines additional unknowns theory parameters previously chosen empirically implemented approach using markov chain monte carlo techniques method provides objective figure merit improves structural quality
