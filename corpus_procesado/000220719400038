quantifying stratospheric ozone upper troposphere situ measurements hcl 
developed chemical ionization mass spectrometry technique precise situ measurements hydrochloric acid hcl high-altitude aircraft measurements subtropical latitudes minimum hcl values found upper troposphere ut often near detection limit measurements parts per billion volume indicating background hcl values much lower global mean estimate however significant abundances hcl observed many ut air parcels result stratosphere-to-troposphere transport events developed method diagnosing amount stratospheric ozone ut parcels using compact linear correlation hcl ozone found throughout lower stratosphere ls expanded use method will lead improved quanti cation cross-tropopause transport events validation global chemical transport models
