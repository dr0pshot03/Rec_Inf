bonding changes compressed superhard graphite 
compressed ambient temperature graphite undergoes transition similar to17 gigapascals near k-edge spectroscopy carbon using synchrotron x-ray inelastic scattering reveals half pi-bonds graphite layers convert sigma-bonds whereas half remain pi-bonds high-pressure form x-ray diffraction pattern high-pressure form consistent distorted graphite structure bridging carbon atoms graphite layers pair form sigma-bonds whereas nonbridging carbon atoms remain unpaired pi-bonds high-pressure form superhard capable indenting cubic-diamond single crystals
