segregation object background motion retina 
important task vision detect objects moving within stationary scene normal viewing complicated presence eye movements continually scan image across retina even fixation detect moving objects brain must distinguish local motion within scene global retinal image drift due fixational eye movements found process begins retina: subset retinal ganglion cells responds motion receptive field centre wider surround moves different trajectory selectivity differential motion independent direction can explained model retinal circuitry invokes pooling nonlinear interneurons suppression global image motion probably mediated polyaxonal wide-field amacrine cells transient responses show population ganglion cells selective differential motion can rapidly flag moving objects even segregate multiple moving objects
