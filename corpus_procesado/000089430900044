role brain insulin receptor control body weight reproduction
insulin receptors irs insulin signaling proteins widely distributed throughout central nervous system cns study physiological role insulin signaling brain created mice neuron-specific disruption ir gene nirko mice inactivation ir impact brain development neuronal survival however female nirko mice showed increased food intake male female mice developed diet-sensitive obesity increases body fat plasma leptin levels mild insulin resistance elevated plasma insulin levels hypertriglyceridemia nirko mice also exhibited impaired spermatogenesis ovarian follicle maturation hypothalamic dysregulation luteinizing hormone thus ir signaling cns plays important role regulation energy disposal fuel metabolism reproduction
