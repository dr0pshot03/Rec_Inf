activation beta-catenin dendritic cells regulates immunity versus tolerance intestine
dendritic cells dcs play vital role initiating robust immunity pathogens well maintaining immunological tolerance self antigens however intracellular signaling networks program dcs become tolerogenic remain unknown report wnt-beta-catenin signaling intestinal dendritic cells regulates balance inflammatory versus regulatory responses gut beta-catenin intestinal dendritic cells required expression anti-inflammatory mediators retinoic acid-metabolizing enzymes interleukin- transforming growth factor-beta stimulation regulatory t cell induction suppressing inflammatory effector t cells furthermore ablation beta-catenin expression dcs enhanced inflammatory responses disease mouse model inflammatory bowel disease thus beta-catenin signaling programs dcs tolerogenic state limiting inflammatory response
