strong male-driven evolution dna sequences humans apes
studies human genetic diseases suggested higher mutation rate males females male-to-female ratio alpha mutation rate estimated dna sequence microsatellite data higher primates- two recent studies however claim alpha humans even smaller estimates alpha > carnivores birds humans higher alpha carnivores birds longer generation time larger sex difference number germ cell cycles resolve issue sequenced noncoding fragment y kilobases kb homologous region chromosome humans greater apes lesser apes show estimate alpha internal branches phylogeny % confidence interval ci infinity similar previous estimates- significantly higher two recent ones contrast external short species-specific branches alpha % ci: - suggest closely related species suitable estimating alpha ancient polymorphism factors moreover provide explanation small estimate previous study study reinstates high alpha hominoids supports view dna replication errors primary source germline mutation
