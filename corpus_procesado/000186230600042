bmi dependence distinguishes neural stem cell self-renewal progenitor proliferation 
stem cells persist throughout life self-renewing numerous tissues including central peripheral nervous systems raises issue whether conserved mechanism effect self-renewing divisions deficiency polycomb family transcriptional repressor bmi leads progressive postnatal growth retardation neurological defects show bmi required self-renewal stem cells peripheral central nervous systems survival differentiation reduced self-renewal bmi--deficient neural stem cells leads postnatal depletion absence bmi- cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor gene p16ink4a upregulated neural stem cells reducing rate proliferation p16ink4a deficiency partially reverses self-renewal defect bmi--/- neural stem cells conserved requirement bmi promote self-renewal repress p16ink4a expression suggests common mechanism regulates self-renewal postnatal persistence diverse types stem cell restricted neural progenitors gut forebrain proliferate normally absence bmi- thus bmi dependence distinguishes stem cell self-renewal restricted progenitor proliferation tissues
