atmospheric sulfur archean komatiite-hosted nickel deposits
earths largest iron-nickel fe-ni sulfide ore deposits formed archean early proterozoic establishing origin metals sulfur deposits critical understanding genesis present multiple sulfur isotope data implying sulfur archean komatiite-hosted fe-ni sulfide deposits previously processed atmosphere accumulated ocean floor high-temperature mantle-derived komatiite magmas able incorporate sulfur seafloor hydrothermal sulfide accumulations sulfidic shales form neoarchean komatiite-hosted fe-ni sulfide deposits time oceans sulfur-poor
