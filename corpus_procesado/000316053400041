genetic basis bacterial mercury methylation 
methylmercury potent neurotoxin produced natural environments inorganic mercury anaerobic bacteria however now genes proteins involved remained unidentified report two-gene cluster hgca hgcb required mercury methylation desulfovibrio desulfuricans nd132 geobacter sulfurreducens pca either bacterium deletion hgca hgcb genes abolishes mercury methylation genes encode putative corrinoid protein hgca [4fe-4s] ferredoxin hgcb consistent roles methyl carrier electron donor required corrinoid cofactor reduction respectively among bacteria archaea sequenced genomes gene orthologs present confirmed methylators absent nonmethylators suggesting common mercury methylation pathway methylating bacteria archaea sequenced date
