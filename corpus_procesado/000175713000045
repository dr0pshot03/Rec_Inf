structural basis transcription initiation: rna polymerase holoenzyme-dna complex 
crystal structure thermus aquaticus rna polymerase holoenzyme alphabetabetaomegasigma-a complexed fork-junction promoter dna fragment determined fitting high-resolution x-ray structures individual components -angstrom resolution map dna lies across one face holoenzyme completely outside rna polymerase active site channel sequence-specific contacts core promoter elements mediated subunit universally conserved tryptophan ideally positioned stack exposed face base pair upstream edge transcription bubble universally conserved basic residues subunit provide critical contacts dna phosphate backbone play role directing melted dna template strand rna polymerase active site structure explains holoenzyme recognizes promoters containing variably spaced elements provides basis models closed open promoter complexes
