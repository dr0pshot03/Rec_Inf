dynamic predictive coding retina
retinal ganglion cells convey visual image eye brain generally encode local differences space changes time rather raw image intensity can seen strategy predictive coding adapted evolution average image statistics natural environment yet animals encounter many environments visual statistics different average scene show happens retina adjusts processing dynamically spatio-temporal receptive fields retinal ganglion cells change seconds new environment changes adaptive new receptive field improves predictive coding new image statistics show network model plastic synapses can account large variety observed adaptations
