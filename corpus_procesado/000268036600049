rip3 energy metabolism regulator switches tnf-induced cell death apoptosis necrosis
necrosis can induced stimulating death receptors tumor necrosis factor tnf agonists however underlying mechanism differentiating necrosis apoptosis largely unknown identified protein kinase receptor-interacting protein rip3 molecular switch tnf-induced apoptosis necrosis nih 3t3 cells found rip3 required necrosis cells rip3 affect rip1-mediated apoptosis required rip1-mediated necrosis enhancement necrosis caspase inhibitor zvad activating key enzymes metabolic pathways rip3 regulates tnf-induced reactive oxygen species production partially accounts rip3s ability promote necrosis data suggest modulation energy metabolism response death stimuli important role choice apoptosis necrosis
