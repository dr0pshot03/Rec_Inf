hemagglutinin receptor binding avidity drives influenza virus antigenic drift 
rapid antigenic evolution influenza virus hemagglutinin precludes effective vaccination existing vaccines understand phenomenon passaged virus mice immunized influenza vaccine neutralizing antibodies selected mutants single-amino acid hemagglutinin substitutions increased virus binding cell surface glycan receptors passaging high-avidity binding mutants naive mice immune mice selected additional hemagglutinin substitutions decreased cellular receptor binding avidity analyzing panel monoclonal antibody hemagglutinin escape mutants revealed positive correlation receptor binding avidity escape polyclonal antibodies propose response variation neutralizing antibody pressure individuals influenza virus evolves adjusting receptor binding avidity via amino acid substitutions throughout hemagglutinin globular domain many simultaneously alter antigenicity
