membrane phosphatidylserine regulates surface charge protein localization 
electrostatic interactions negatively charged membranes contribute subcellular targeting proteins polybasic clusters cationic domains although anionic phospholipid phosphatidylserine comparatively abundant contribution surface charge individual cellular membranes unknown partly lack reagents analyze distribution intact cells developed biosensor study subcellular distribution phosphatidylserine found binds cytosolic leaflets plasma membrane well endosomes lysosomes negative charge associated presence phosphatidylserine directed proteins moderately positive charge endocytic pathway strongly cationic proteins normally associated plasma membrane relocalized endocytic compartments plasma membrane surface charge decreased calcium influx
