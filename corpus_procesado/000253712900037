fiber-optical analog event horizon
physics event horizon resembles behavior waves moving media horizons formed local speed medium exceeds wave velocity used ultrashort pulses microstructured optical fibers demonstrate formation artificial event horizon optics observed classical optical effect : blue-shifting light white-hole horizon also showed theoretical calculations system capable probing quantum effects horizons particular hawking radiation
