acceleration rain initiation cloud turbulence 
vapour condensation cloud cores produces small droplets close one another size droplets believed grow raindrop size coalescence due collision air turbulence thought main cause collisions similar-sized droplets exceeding radii micrometres therefore rain prediction requires quantitative description droplet collision turbulence- turbulent vortices act small centrifuges spin heavy droplets creating concentration inhomogeneities - jets droplets increase mean collision rate derive formula collision rate small heavy particles turbulent flow using recently developed formalism tracing random trajectories describe enhancement inertial effects turbulence intermittency interplay turbulence gravity determines collision rate present new mechanism sling effect collisions due jets droplets become detached air flow conclude air turbulence can substantially accelerate appearance large droplets trigger rain
