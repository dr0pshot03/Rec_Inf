jetlag resets drosophila circadian clock promoting light-induced degradation timeless
organisms ranging bacteria humans synchronize internal clocks daily cycles light dark photic entrainment drosophila clock mediated proteasomal degradation clock protein timeless tim identified mutations jetlag-a gene coding f-box protein leucine-rich repeats-that result reduced light sensitivity circadian clock mutant flies show rhythmic behavior constant light reduced phase shifts response light pulses reduced light-dependent degradation tim expression jet along circadian photoreceptor cryptochrome cry cultured s2r+ cells confers light-dependent degradation onto tim thereby reconstituting acute response circadian clock light cell culture system results suggest jet essential resetting clock transmitting light signals cry tim
