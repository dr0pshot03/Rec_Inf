evolution digital organisms high mutation rates leads survival flattest 
darwinian evolution favours genotypes high replication rates process called survival fittest however knowing replication rate individual genotype may suffice predict eventual survivor even asexual population according quasi-species theory selection favours cloud genotypes interconnected mutation whose average replication rate highest1- confirm prediction using digital organisms self-replicate mutate evolve6- forty pairs populations derived different ancestors identical selective environments except one pair experienced -fold higher mutation rate cases dominant genotype evolved lower mutation rate achieved replication rate >-fold faster counterpart allowed disparate pairs compete across range mutation rates case mutation rate increased outcome competition switched favour genotype lower replication rate genotypes although occupied lower fitness peaks located flatter regions fitness surface therefore robust respect mutations
