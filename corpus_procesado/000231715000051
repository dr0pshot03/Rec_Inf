elucidation small rna component transcriptome 
small rnas play important regulatory roles eukaryotes small proportion molecules identified sequenced two million small rnas seedlings inflorescence model plant arabidopsis thaliana known new micrornas mirnas among abundant nonredundant set sequences whereas half represented lower abundance small interfering rnas sirnas match repetitive sequences intergenic regions genes individual clusters highly regulated small rnas readily observed targets antisense rna mirna appear preferentially associated sirnas many genomic regions previously considered featureless found sites numerous small rnas
