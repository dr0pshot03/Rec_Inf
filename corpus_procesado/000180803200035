disruption fragmented parent bodies origin asteroid families
asteroid families groups small bodies share certain orbit spectral properties families now identified believed resulted collisional break-up large parent body regime gravity controls outcome collision material strength rock size velocity distributions family members provide important constraints testing understanding break-up process erosion dynamical diffusion orbits time can erase original signature collision recently identified young karin family provides unique opportunity study collisional outcome almost unaffected orbit evolution report numerical simulations modelling classes collisions reproduce main characteristics karin family sensitivity outcome collision internal structure parent body allows us show family must originated break-up pre-fragmented parent body large family members formed gravitational reaccumulation smaller bodies argue identified asteroid families likely similar history
