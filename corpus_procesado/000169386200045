spatial awareness function temporal posterior parietal lobe 
current understanding spatial behaviour parietal lobe function largely based belief spatial neglect humans lack awareness space side body contralateral brain injury typically associated lesions posterior parietal lobe however monkeys disorder observed lesions superior temporal cortex1 puzzling discrepancy species show contrary widely accepted view superior temporal cortex neural substrate spatial neglect humans monkeys unlike monkey brain spatial awareness humans function largely confined right superior temporal cortex location topographically reminiscent language left2 hence decisive phylogenetic transition monkey human brain seems restriction formerly bilateral function right side rather shift temporal parietal lobe one may speculate lateralization spatial awareness parallels emergence elaborate representation language left side
