unidirectional emission quantum dot coupled nanoantenna 
nanoscale quantum emitters key elements quantum optics sensing however efficient optical excitation detection emitters involves large solid angles interaction freely propagating light omnidirectional present unidirectional emission single emitter coupling nanofabricated yagi-uda antenna quantum dot placed near field antenna drives resonant feed element antenna resulting quantum-dot luminescence strongly polarized highly directed narrow forward angular cone directionality quantum dot can controlled tuning antenna dimensions results show potential optical antennas communicate energy nano-emitters
