long-term sensitivity soil carbon turnover warming
sensitivity soil carbon warming major uncertainty projections carbon dioxide concentration climate experimental studies overwhelmingly indicate increased soil organic carbon soc decomposition- higher temperatures resulting increased carbon dioxide emissions soils however recent findings cited evidence increased soil carbon emissions warmer world soil warming experiments initially increased carbon dioxide efflux returns pre-warming rates within one three years- apparent carbon pool turnover times insensitive temperature already suggested apparent lack temperature dependence artefact due neglecting extreme heterogeneity soil carbon explicit model yet presented can reconcile findings present simple three-pool model partitions soc components different intrinsic turnover rates using model show results soil-warming experiments compatible long-term temperature sensitivity soc turnover: can explained rapid depletion labile soc combined negligible response non-labile soc experimental timescales furthermore present evidence non-labile soc sensitive temperature labile soc implying long-term positive feedback soil decomposition warming world may even stronger predicted global models-
