cohesin ring concatenates sister dna molecules 
sister chromatid cohesion essential mitosis mediated multi subunit protein complex called cohesin cohesins scc1 smc1 smc3 subunits form tripartite ring structure proposed cohesin holds sister dna molecules together trapping inside ring test used site specific crosslinking create chemical connections three interfaces three constituent polypeptides ring thereby creating covalently closed cohesin rings predicted ring entrapment model procedure produced dimeric dna cohesin structures resistant protein denaturation conclude cohesin rings concatenate individual sister minichromosome dna molecules
