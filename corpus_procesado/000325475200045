human influences nitrogen removal lakes 
human activities increased availability reactive nitrogen many ecosystems leading negative impacts human health biodiversity water quality freshwater ecosystems including lakes streams wetlands large global sink reactive nitrogen factors determine efficacy freshwater nitrogen removal rates poorly known using global lake data set show availability phosphorus limiting nutrient affects annual nitrogen removal rate efficiency result indicates increased phosphorus inputs human activities stimulated nitrogen removal processes many lakes recent management-driven reductions phosphorus availability promote water column accumulation export nitrogen large lakes unintended consequence single-element management argues greater control nitrogen well phosphorus sources
