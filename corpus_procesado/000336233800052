recurrent somatic mutations underlie corticotropin-independent cushings syndrome
cushings syndrome caused excess cortisol production adrenocortical gland corticotropin-independent cushings syndrome excess cortisol production primarily attributed adrenocortical adenoma underlying molecular pathogenesis poorly understood report hotspot mutation l206r prkaca encodes catalytic subunit cyclic adenosine monophosphate camp-dependent protein kinase pka % cases adrenocortical adenomas associated corticotropin-independent cushings syndrome l206r prkaca mutant abolished binding regulatory subunit pka prkar1a inhibits catalytic activity prkaca leading constitutive camp-independent pka activation results highlight major role camp-independent activation camp/pka signaling somatic mutations corticotropin-independent cushings syndrome providing insights diagnosis therapeutics syndrome
