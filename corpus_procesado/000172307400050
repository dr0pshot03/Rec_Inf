priming memory effector cd8 t cells killed bacterial vaccine
killed inactivated vaccines targeting intracellular bacterial protozoal pathogens notoriously ineffective generating protective immunity example vaccination heat-killed listeria monocytogenes hklm protective although infection live l monocytogenes induces long-lived cd8 t cell-mediated immunity demonstrate hklm immunization primes memory cd8 t lymphocyte populations although substantial size ineffective providing protection subsequent l monocytogenes infection contrast live infection elicits large numbers effector cd8 t cells hklm immunization primes t lymphocytes acquire effector functions studies show possible dissociate t cell-dependent protective immunity memory t cell expansion generation effector t cells may necessary long-term protective immunity
