landscape transcription human cells 
eukaryotic cells make many types primary processed rnas found either specific subcellular compartments throughout cells complete catalogue rnas yet available characteristic subcellular localizations also poorly understood rna represents direct output genetic information encoded genomes significant proportion cells regulatory capabilities focused synthesis processing transport modification translation generation catalogue crucial understanding genome function report evidence three-quarters human genome capable transcribed well observations range levels expression localization processing fates regulatory regions modifications almost currently annotated thousands previously unannotated rnas observations taken together prompt redefinition concept gene
