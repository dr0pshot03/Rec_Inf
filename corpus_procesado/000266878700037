determining dynamics entanglement 
estimation entanglement multipartite systems undergoing decoherence important assessing robustness quantum information processes usually requires access final state full reconstruction quantum tomography general dynamical laws may simplify task found one parties initially entangled two-qubit system subject noisy channel single universal curve describes dynamics entanglement pure mixed states including entanglement suddenly disappears result experimentally demonstrated using linear optics setup leads direct efficient determination entanglement knowledge initial state single-party process tomography alone foregoing need reconstruct final state
