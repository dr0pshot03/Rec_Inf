essential role corest nucleosomal histone lysine demethylation
previously described multiprotein complex termed bhc braf hdac complex required repression neuronal-specific genes shown bhc complex recruited neuronal silencer rest re1-silencing transcription factor mediates repression rest-responsive genes1 bhc multiprotein complex consisting two enzymatic activities: histone deacetylase hdac1 recently described histone demethylase bhc110 also known lsd1 aof2- show bhc110-containing complexes show nearly fivefold increase demethylation histone h3 lysine h3k4 compared recombinant bhc110 furthermore recombinant bhc110 unable demethylate h3k4 nucleosomes bhc110-containing complexes readily demethylate nucleosomes vitro reconstitution bhc complex using recombinant subunits reveals essential role rest corepressor corest stimulating demethylation core histones also promoting demethylation nucleosomal substrates find nucleosomal demethylation result corest enhancing association bhc110 nucleosomes depletion corest vivo cell culture results de-repression rest-responsive gene expression increased methylation h3k4 together results highlight essential role corest demethylation h3k4 vitro vivo
