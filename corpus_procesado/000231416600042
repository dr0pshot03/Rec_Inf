base stacking controls excited-state dynamics a-t dna
solar ultraviolet light creates excited electronic states dna can decay mutagenic photoproducts vulnerability compensated organisms enzymatic repair photodamaged dna repair energetically costly dna intrinsically photostable single bases eliminate electronic energy non-radiatively subpicosecond timescale base stacking base pairing mediate decay excess electronic energy double helix poorly understood ways past considerable attention paid excited base pairs recent reports suggested light-triggered motion proton one hydrogen bonds isolated base pair initiates non-radiative decay electronic ground state show vertical base stacking base pairing determines fate excited singlet electronic states single double-stranded oligonucleotides composed adenine thymine t bases intrastrand excimer states lifetimes ps formed high yields whenever stacked t excimers limit excitation energy one strand time b-form double helix enabling repair using undamaged strand template
