evidence fluid inclusions microbial methanogenesis early archaean era 
methanogenic microbes may one primitive organisms although uncertain methanogens first appeared earth archaean era gyr ago methanogens may important regulating climate provided sufficient amounts greenhouse gas methane mitigate severely frozen condition resulted lower solar luminosity times nevertheless direct geological evidence hitherto available support existence methanogens archaean period although circumstantial evidence available form similar -gyr-old carbon-isotope-depleted kerogen report crushing extraction carbon isotope analysis methane-bearing fluid inclusions similar -gyr-old hydrothermal precipitates pilbara craton australia results indicate extracted fluids contain microbial methane carbon isotopic compositions less parts per thousand included within original precipitates provides oldest evidence methanogen > gyr ago pre-dating previous geochemical evidence million years
