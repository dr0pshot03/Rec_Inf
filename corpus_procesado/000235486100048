efficient auditory coding 
auditory neural code must serve wide range auditory tasks require great sensitivity time frequency effective diverse array sounds present natural acoustic environments suggested- sensory systems might evolved highly efficient coding strategies maximize information conveyed brain minimizing required energy neural resources show natural sounds complete acoustic waveform can represented efficiently nonlinear model based population spike code model idealized spikes encode precise temporal positions magnitudes underlying acoustic features find features optimized coding either natural sounds speech show striking similarities time-domain cochlear filter estimates frequency-bandwidth dependence similar auditory nerve fibres yield significantly greater coding efficiency conventional signal representations results indicate auditory code might approach information theoretic optimum acoustic structure speech might adapted coding capacity mammalian auditory system
