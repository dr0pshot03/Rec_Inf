anomalous polarization profiles sunspots: possible origin umbral flashes
present time-series spectropolarimetric observations sunspots ca ii infrared triplet lines show periodic occurrence anomalous asymmetric circular polarization profiles umbral chromosphere profiles may caused periodic development unresolved atmospheric component downward flowing magnetized environment active component upward directed velocities high kilometers per second connected umbral flash uf phenomenon can explain observations semiempirical model chromospheric oscillation sunspot magnetized atmospheric plasma uf event
