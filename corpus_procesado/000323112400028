deterministic quantum teleportation photonic quantum bits hybrid technique
quantum teleportation allows transfer arbitrary unknown quantum states sender spatially distant receiver provided two parties share entangled state can communicate classically essence many sophisticated protocols quantum communication computation- photons optimal choice carrying information form flying qubits teleportation photonic quantum bits- qubits limited experimental inefficiencies restrictions main disadvantages include fundamentally probabilistic nature linear-optics bell measurements well need either destroy teleported qubit attenuate input qubit detectors resolve photon numbers experimentally realize fully deterministic quantum teleportation photonic qubits without post-selection key step make use hybrid technique involving continuous-variable teleportation- discrete-variable photonic qubit receivers feedforward gain optimally tuned continuous-variable teleporter acts pure loss channel input dual-rail-encoded qubit based single photon represents quantum error detection code photon loss hence remains completely intact teleportation events allows faithful qubit transfer even imperfect continuous-variable entangled states: four qubits overall transfer fidelities range exceed classical limit teleportation furthermore even relatively low level entanglement qubits teleported much efficiently previous experiments albeit post-selectively taking account qubit subspaces fidelity comparable previously reported values
