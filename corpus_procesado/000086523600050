metapopulation capacity fragmented landscape 
ecologists conservation biologists used many measures landscape structure- predict population dynamic consequences habitat loss fragmentation- measures well justified population dynamic theory introduce new measure highly fragmented landscapes termed metapopulation capacity rigorously derived metapopulation theory can easily applied real networks habitat fragments known areas connectivities technically metapopulation capacity leading eigenvalue appropriate landscape matrix species predicted persist landscape metapopulation capacity landscape greater threshold value determined properties species therefore metapopulation capacity can conveniently used rank different landscapes terms capacity support viable metapopulations present empirical example multiple networks occupied endangered species butterfly using theory may also calculate metapopulation capacity changed removing habitat fragments adding new ones specific spatial locations changing areas metapopulation capacity rnd many applications metapopulation ecology landscape ecology conservation biology
