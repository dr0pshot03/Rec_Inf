phosphorylation innate immune adaptor proteins mavs sting trif induces irf3 activation 
virus infection adaptor proteins mavs sting transduce signals cytosolic nucleic acid sensors rig-i cgas respectively induce type interferons ifns antiviral molecules show mavs sting harbor two conserved serine threonine clusters phosphorylated kinases ikk and/or tbk1 response stimulation phosphorylated mavs sting bind positively charged surface interferon regulatory factor irf3 thereby recruit irf3 phosphorylation activation tbk1 show trif adaptor protein toll-like receptor signaling activates irf3 similar phosphorylation-dependent mechanism results reveal phosphorylation innate adaptor proteins essential conserved mechanism selectively recruits irf3 activate type ifn pathway
