redox regulation forkhead proteins p66shc-dependent signaling pathway
genetic determinants longevity include forkhead-related transcription factor daf worm caenorhabditis elegans p66shc locus mice demonstrate p66shc regulates intracellular oxidant levels mammalian cells hydrogen peroxide can negatively regulate forkhead activity p66shc-/- cells activity mammalian forkhead homolog fkhrl1 increased redox-dependent forkhead inactivation reduced addition expression fkhrl1 results increase hydrogen peroxide scavenging oxidative stress resistance results demonstrate important functional relation three distinct elements linked aging: forkhead proteins p66shc intracellular oxidants
