canonical stability-elasticity relationship verified one million face-centred-cubic structures 
thermodynamically stable metastable phase corresponds local minimum potentially complicated energy landscape however complex crystal might energy landscape parabolic shape near minima roughly speaking depth energy well respect reference level determines thermodynamic stability system steepness parabola near minimum determines systems elastic properties although changing alloying elements concentrations given material enhance certain properties dates back bronze age systematic search desirable properties metastable atomic configurations fixed stoichiometry recent tool materials design demonstrate using first-principles studies four binary alloy systems elastic properties face-centred-cubic intermetallic compounds obey certain rules reach two conclusions based calculations huge subset face-centred-cubic configuration space first stiffness heat formation negatively correlated nearly constant spearman correlation concentrations second averaged stiffness metastable configurations fixed concentration decays linearly distance ground-state line phase diagram alloy zero kelvin hope methods will help simplify quest new materials optimal properties vast configuration space available
