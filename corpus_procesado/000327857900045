phase mismatch-free nonlinear propagation optical zero-index materials 
phase matching critical requirement coherent nonlinear optical processes frequency conversion parametric amplification phase mismatch prevents microscopic nonlinear sources combining constructively resulting destructive interference thus low efficiency report experimental demonstration phase mismatch-free nonlinear generation zero-index optical metamaterial contrast phase mismatch compensation techniques required conventional nonlinear media zero index eliminates need phase matching allowing efficient nonlinear generation forward backward directions demonstrate phase mismatch-free nonlinear generation using intrapulse four-wave mixing observed forward-to-backward nonlinear emission ratio close unity removal phase matching nonlinear optical metamaterials may lead applications multidirectional frequency conversion entangled photon generation
