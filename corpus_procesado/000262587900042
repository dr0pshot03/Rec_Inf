different t cell receptor signals determine cd8+ memory versus effector development 
following infection naive cd8+ t cells bearing pathogen specific t cell receptors tcrs differentiate mixed population short lived effector long lived memory t cells mediate adaptive immune response tcr regulates memory t cell development remained elusive using mutant tcr transgenic model found point mutations tcr beta transmembrane domain beta tmd impair development function cd8+ memory t cells without affecting primary effector t cell responses mutant t cells deficient polarizing tcr organizing nuclear factor kappa b signal immunological synapse thus effector memory states cd8+ t cells separable fates determined differential tcr signaling
