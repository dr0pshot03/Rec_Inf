mechanical explanation rna pseudoknot function programmed ribosomal frameshifting 
triplet-based genetic code requires translating ribosomes maintain reading frame messenger rna faithfully ensure correct protein synthesis however programmed ribosomal frameshifting specific subversion frame maintenance takes place wherein ribosome forced shift one nucleotide backwards overlapping reading frame translate entirely new sequence amino acids process indispensable replication numerous viral pathogens including hiv coronavirus associated severe acute respiratory syndrome also exploited expression several cellular genes frameshifting promoted mrna signal composed two essential elements: heptanucleotide slippery sequence adjacent mrna secondary structure often mrna pseudoknot components operate together manipulate ribosome unknown describe observation ribosome mrna pseudoknot complex stalled process frameshifting cryoelectron microscopic imaging purified mammalian 80s ribosomes rabbit reticulocytes paused coronavirus pseudoknot reveals intermediate frameshifting process can seen pseudoknot interacts ribosome block mrna entrance channel compromising translocation process leading spring-like deformation p-site transfer rna addition identify movements likely eukaryotic ribosomal helicase confirm direct interaction translocase eef2 p-site trna together structural changes provide mechanical explanation pseudoknot manipulates ribosome different reading frame
