diversity-dependent production can decrease stability ecosystem functioning 
concern species loss may adversely affect ecosystem functioning stability although evidence biodiversity loss can lead reductions biomass production1- direct evidence biodiversity loss affects ecosystem resistance ability withstand perturbation resilience recovery perturbation yet theory56 laboratory experiments7- indirect experimental evidence12- strongly suggest diversity stability related report results field experiment factorially crossed perturbation diversity manipulations simulated drought perturbation constructed grassland ecosystems containing plant species unperturbed conditions species-poor systems achieved lower biomass production species-rich systems however species-poor systems resistant perturbation species-rich systems species-poor systems also showed larger initial resilience following perturbation although original relationship diversity productivity fully restored year results confirm biodiversity increases biomass production also point fact diversity-production associations may lead inverse relationship biodiversity stability ecosystem functioning
