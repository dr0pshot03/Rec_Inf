experimental evidence frustrated energy landscape three-helix-bundle protein family 
energy landscape theory powerful tool understanding structure dynamics complex molecular systems particular biological macromolecules primary sequence protein defines free-energy landscape thus determines folding pathway rate constants folding unfolding well proteins native structure theory shown roughness energy landscape will lead slower folding derivation detailed experimental descriptions landscape challenging simple folding models show folding significantly influenced chain entropy proteins contacts local fold quickly owing low entropy cost forming stabilizing native contacts folding protein families stability also determinant folding rate constants simple metrics fail predict folding behaviour probable features energy landscape unusual general observations explain folding behaviour r15 r16 r17 domains alpha-spectrin r15 folds similar times faster homologues although similar structures stabilities far can determined transition-state stabilities- show landscape roughness internal friction responsible slower folding unfolding r16 r17 use chimaeric domains demonstrate internal friction property core suggest frustration landscape slow-folding spectrin domains may due misdocking long helices folding theoretical studies suggested rugged landscapes will result slower folding show experimentally phenomenon directly influences folding kinetics normal protein one significant energy barrier folds relatively slow millisecond-second timescale
