rna map predicting nova-dependent splicing regulation
nova proteins neuron-specific alternative splicing factors combined bioinformatics biochemistry genetics derive rna map describing rules nova proteins regulate alternative splicing map revealed position nova binding sites ycay clusters pre-messenger rna determines outcome splicing map correctly predicted novas effect inhibit enhance exon inclusion led us examine relationship map novas mechanism action nova binding exonic ycay cluster changed protein complexes assembled pre-mrna blocking u1 snrnp small nuclear ribonucleoprotein binding exon inclusion whereas nova binding intronic ycay cluster enhanced spliceosome assembly exon inclusion assays splicing intermediates nova-regulated transcripts mouse brain revealed nova preferentially regulates removal introns harbouring closest ycay clusters results define genome-wide map relating position cis-acting element regulation rna binding protein namely nova binding ycay clusters results local asymmetric action regulate spliceosome assembly alternative splicing neurons
