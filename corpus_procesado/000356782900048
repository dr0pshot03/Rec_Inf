sexual selection protects extinction 
reproduction sex carries substantial costs mainly half sexual adults produce offspring1 theorized costs countered sex allows sexual selection clear universal fitness constraint mutation load2- sexual selection competition usually males mate choice usually females create important intraspecific filters reproductive success subset males gains paternity reproductive success sexual selection dependent individual condition contingent mutation load sexually selected filtering genic capture5 offset costs sex provides genetic benefits populations test theory experimentally comparing whether populations histories strong versus weak sexual selection purge mutation load resist extinction differently evolving replicate populations flour beetle tribolium castaneum years conditions differed solely strengths sexual selection revealed mutation load using inbreeding lineages populations previously experienced strong sexual selection resilient extinction maintained fitness inbreeding families continuing survive generations sib sib mating contrast lineages derived populations experienced weak nonexistent sexual selection showed rapid fitness declines inbreeding extinct generation multiple mutations across genome individually small effects can difficult clear yet sum significant fitness load; findings reveal sexual selection reduces load improving population viability face genetic stress
