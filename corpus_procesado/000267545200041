parallel circuit lif signalling pathways maintains pluripotency mouse es cells 
cytokine leukaemia inhibitory factor lif integrates signals mouse embryonic stem es cells maintain pluripotency although jak-stat3 pathway essential sufficient mediate lif signals12 still unclear signals linked core circuitry pluripotency-associated transcription factors consisting oct3/ also called pou5f1 sox2 nanog34 show two lif signalling pathways connected core circuitry via different transcription factors mouse es cells klf4 mainly activated jak-stat3 pathway preferentially activates sox2 whereas tbx3 preferentially regulated phosphatidylinositol--oh kinase-akt mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways predominantly stimulates nanog absence lif artificial expression klf4 tbx3 sufficient maintain pluripotency maintaining expression oct3/ notably overexpression nanog supports lif-independent self-renewal mouse es cells absence klf4 tbx3 activity therefore klf4 tbx3 involved mediating lif signalling core circuitry directly associated maintenance pluripotency es cells keep pluripotency without expression particular context
