parasympathetic ganglia derive schwann cell precursors
neural crest cells migrate extensively give rise peripheral nervous system including sympathetic parasympathetic enteric dorsal root ganglia studied parasympathetic ganglia form close visceral organs precursors find many cranial nerve-associated crest cells coexpress pan-autonomic determinant paired-like homeodomain 2b phox2b together markers schwann cell precursors give rise schwann cells down-regulation phox2b others form parasympathetic ganglia guided site ganglion formation nerves carry preganglionic fibers parsimonious way wiring pathway thus cranial schwann cell precursors source parasympathetic neurons normal development
