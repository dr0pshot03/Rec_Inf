retroviruses use cd169-mediated trans-infection permissive lymphocytes establish infection
dendritic cells can capture transfer retroviruses vitro across synaptic cell-cell contacts uninfected cells process called trans-infection whether trans-infection contributes retroviral spread vivo remains unknown visualize retroviruses disseminate secondary lymphoid tissues living mice demonstrate murine leukemia virus mlv human immunodeficiency virus hiv first captured sinus-lining macrophages cd169/siglec- i-type lectin recognizes gangliosides captures virus mlv-laden macrophages form long-lived synaptic contacts trans-infect b cells infected b cells subsequently migrate lymph node spread infection virological synapses robust infection lymph nodes spleen requires cd169 suggesting combination fluid-based movement followed cd169-dependent trans-infection can contribute viral spread
