magnetite defines vertebrate magnetoreceptor
key behavioural physiological anatomical components magnetite-based magnetic sense demonstrated rainbow trout oncorhynchus mykiss candidate receptor cells located within discrete sub-layer olfactory lamellae contained iron-rich crystals similar size shape magnetite crystals extracted salmon show crystals mapped individual receptors using confocal atomic force microscopy magnetic uniquely associated dipoles detected magnetic force microscopy analysis magnetic properties identifies crystals single-domain magnetite addition three-dimensional reconstruction candidate receptors using confocal atomic force microscopy imaging confirm several magnetic crystals arranged chain mm within receptor receptor multi-lobed single cell results consistent magnetite-based detection mechanism mu m chains single-domain magnetite crystals highly suitable behavioural physiological responses magnetic intensity previously reported trout
