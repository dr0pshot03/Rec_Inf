fc receptor complement binding important antibody protection hiv 
successful vaccines elicit neutralizing antibodies property high priority developing hiv vaccine12 indeed passively administered neutralizing antibodies shown protect hiv challenge best available animal models example antibodies given intravenously can protect macaques intravenous mucosal shiv hiv/siv chimaera challenge topically applied antibodies can protect macaques vaginal shiv challenge34 however mechanisms neutralizing antibodies afford protection hiv understood particular role antibody fc-mediated effector functions unclear report dramatic decrease ability broadly neutralizing antibody protect macaques shiv challenge fc receptor complement-binding activities engineered antibody loss antibody protective activity associated elimination complement binding alone vivo results consistent vitro assays indicating interaction fc-receptor-bearing effector cells antibody-complexed infected cells important reducing virus yield infected cells overall data suggest potential importance activity infected cells free virus effective protection hiv
