pif1p helicase catalytic inhibitor telomerase yeast 
mutations yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae pif1 gene encodes -to-/ dna helicase cause telomere lengthening large increase formation rate new telomeres show pif1p acts inhibiting telomerase rather telomere-telomere recombination inhibition requires helicase activity pif1p overexpression enzymatically active pif1p causes telomere shortening thus pif1p catalytic inhibitor telomerase-mediated telomere lengthening pif1p associated telomeric dna vivo effects telomeres likely direct pif1p-like helicases found diverse organisms including humans propose pif1p-mediated inhibition telomerase promotes genetic stability suppressing telomerase-mediated healing double-strand breaks
