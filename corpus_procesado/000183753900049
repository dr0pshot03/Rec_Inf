opposing basal ganglia processes shape midbrain visuomotor activity bilaterally 
manner nervous system allocates limited motor resources confronted conflicting behavioural demands crucial issue understanding sensory information transformed adaptive motor responses understanding selection process particular concern current models functions basal ganglia report basal ganglia use simultaneous enhancing suppressing processes synergistically modulate sensory activity superior colliculi bilaterally paired midbrain structures involved control visual orientation behaviours complementary processes presumably ensure accurate gaze shifts mediated superior colliculi despite presence potential distractors
