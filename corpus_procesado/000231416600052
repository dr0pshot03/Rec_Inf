dna damage pathway regulates innate immune system ligands nkg2d receptor
stimulatory receptors innate immune system nkg2d receptor also called klrk1 expressed natural killer cells activated cd8+ t cells recognize self-molecules upregulated diseased cells poorly understood mechanisms show mouse human nkg2d ligands upregulated non-tumour cell lines genotoxic stress stalled dna replication conditions known activate major dna damage checkpoint pathway initiated atm ataxia telangiectasia mutated atr atm rad3-related protein kinases ligand upregulation prevented pharmacological genetic inhibition atr atm chk1 downstream transducer kinase pathway furthermore constitutive ligand expression tumour cell line inhibited targeting short interfering rna atm suggesting ligand expression established tumour cells often harbour genomic irregularities may due chronic activation dna damage response pathway thus dna damage response previously shown arrest cell cycle enhance dna repair functions trigger apoptosis may also participate alerting immune system presence potentially dangerous cells
