chromospheric anemone jets evidence ubiquitous reconnection
heating solar chromosphere corona long standing puzzle solar physics hinode observations show ubiquitous presence chromospheric anemone jets outside sunspots active regions typically arc seconds kilometers long arc second kilometers wide velocity kilometers per second small jets inverted y shape similar shape x ray anemone jets corona features imply magnetic reconnection similar corona occurring much smaller spatial scale throughout chromosphere suggest heating solar chromosphere corona may related small scale ubiquitous reconnection
