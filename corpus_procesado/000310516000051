tricking guard: exploiting plant defense disease susceptibility 
typically pathogens deploy virulence effectors disable defense plants defeat effectors resistance proteins guard effector targets found pathogen exploits resistance protein activating confer susceptibility arabidopsis guard mechanism plant defense recapitulated interactions among victorin effector produced necrotrophic fungus cochliobolus victoriae trx-h5 defense-associated thioredoxin lov1 arabidopsis susceptibility protein lov1s absence victorin inhibits trx-h5 resulting compromised defense disease c victoriae lov1s presence victorin binding trx-h5 activates lov1 elicits resistance-like response confers disease susceptibility propose victorin mimics conventional pathogen virulence effector defeated lov1 confers virulence c victoriae solely incites defense
