one-dimensional nature magnetic fluctuations yba2cu3o6 
increasing evidence inhomogeneous distributions charge spin-so-called striped phases-play important role determining properties high-temperature superconductors example recent neutron-scattering measurements yba2cu3o7-x family materials show spin charge fluctuations consistent striped-phase picture fluctuations associated striped phase expected one-dimensional whereas magnetic fluctuations observed date appear display two-dimensional symmetry show apparent two-dimensionality results measurements twinned crystals similar measurements substantially detwinned crystals yba2cu3o6 reveal one-dimensional character magnetic fluctuations thus greatly strengthening striped-phase interpretation moreover results also suggest superconductivity originates charge stripes extend along b crystal axis superfluid density found substantially larger direction
