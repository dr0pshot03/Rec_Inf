suppressing roughness virtual times parallel discrete-event simulations
parallel discrete-event simulation pdes scheme tasks distributed among processing elements pes whose progress controlled synchronization scheme lattice systems short-range interactions progress conservative pdes scheme governed kardar-parisi-zhang equation theory nonequilibrium surface growth although simulated virtual times pes progress nonzero rate standard deviation spread diverges number pes hindering efficient data collection show weak random interactions among pes can make spread nondivergent pes progress nonzero near-uniform rate without requiring global synchronizations
