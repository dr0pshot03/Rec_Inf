late cretaceous polar wander pacific plate: evidence rapid true polar wander event 
reexamined late cretaceous-early tertiary apparent polar wander path pacific plate using paleomagnetic poles seamounts dated ar-/ar- geochronology path shows little motion million years ago ma northward motion ma two groups poles separated degrees indistinguishable mean ages +/ ma latter phenomenon may represent rapid polar wander episode degrees per million years whose timing adequately resolved existing data similar features polar wander paths imply event rapid shift spin axis relative mantle true polar wander may related global changes plate motion large igneous province eruptions shift magnetic field polarity state
