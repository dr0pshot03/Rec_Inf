evolution archaean crust delamination shallow subduction 
archaean oceanic crust probably thicker present-day oceanic crust owing higher heat flow thus higher degrees melting mid-ocean ridges1 conditions also led different bulk composition oceanic crust early archaean probably consisted magnesium-rich picrite variably differentiated portions made basalt gabbro ultramafic cumulates picrite unclear whether differences influenced crustal subduction recycling processes experiments investigated metamorphic reactions take place subduction date considered modern mid-ocean-ridge basalts23 present data high-pressure experiments show metamorphism ultramafic cumulates picrites produces pyroxenites infer delaminated melted produce basaltic rocks rather continental crust previously thought instead formation continental crust requires subduction melting garnet-amphibolite4-formed upper regions oceanic crust-which thought first occurred large scale subduction late archaean5 deduce shallow subduction recycling oceanic crust took place early archaean resulted strong depletion thin layer uppermost mantle misfit geochemical depletion models geophysical models mantle convection include deep subduction might therefore explained continuous deepening depleted layer geological time56
