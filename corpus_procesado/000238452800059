topoisomerase ii beta-mediated dsdna break required regulated transcription 
multiple enzymatic activities required transcriptional initiation enzyme dna topoisomerase ii associates gene promoter regions can generate breaks double-stranded dna dsdna therefore interest know whether enzyme critical regulated gene activation report signal-dependent activation gene transcription nuclear receptors classes dna binding transcription factors including activating protein requires dna topoisomerase ii beta-dependent transient site-specific dsdna break formation subsequent break poly adenosine diphosphate-ribose polymerase- enzymatic activity induced required nucleosome-specific histone h1-high-mobility group b exchange event local changes chromatin architecture data mechanistically link dna topoisomerase iib-dependent dsdna breaks components dna damage repair machinery regulated gene transcription
