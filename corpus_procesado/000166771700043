lack replicative senescence cultured rat oligodendrocyte precursor cells
mammalian somatic cells thought limited proliferative capacity permanently stop dividing finite number divisions culture state termed replicative cell senescence show oligodendrocyte precursor cells purified postnatal rat optic nerve can proliferate indefinitely serum-free culture prevented differentiating various cell cycle-inhibitory proteins increase cells stop dividing cells maintain high telomerase activity p53 rb-dependent cell cycle checkpoint responses serum genotoxic drugs induce acquire senescence-like phenotype findings suggest normal rodent precursor cells unlimited proliferative capacity cultured conditions avoid differentiation activation checkpoint responses arrest cell cycle
