probing solvent-assisted nucleation pathway chemical self-assembly 
hierarchical self-assembly offers powerful strategy producing molecular nanostructures although widely used mechanistic details self-assembly processes poorly understood spectroscopically monitored nucleation process self-assembly pi-conjugated molecules helical supramolecular fibrillar structures data support nucleation-growth pathway gives rise remarkably high degree cooperativity furthermore characterize helical transition nucleating species growth self-assembly process depends strongly solvent structure suggesting organized shell solvent molecules plays explicit role rigidifying aggregates guiding toward assembly bundles and/or gels
