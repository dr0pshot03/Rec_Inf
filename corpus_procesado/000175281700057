influence gene action across different time scales behavior
genes can affect natural behavioral variation different ways allelic variation causes alternative behavioral phenotypes whereas changes gene expression can influence initiation behavior different ages show age-related transition honey bees hive work foraging associated increase expression foraging gene encodes guanosine -monophosphate cgmp-dependent protein kinase pkg cgmp treatment elevated pkg activity caused foraging behavior previous research showed allelic differences pkg expression result two drosophila foraging variants gene can thus exert different types influence behavior
