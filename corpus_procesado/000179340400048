silico simulations reveal replicators limited dispersal evolve towards higher efficiency fidelity 
emergence functional replicases acting quickly high accuracy crucial origin life although first rna molecules came still unknown nevertheless assumed catalytic rna enzymes ribozymes replicase function emerged early stage evolution fidelity copying especially important mutation load limits length replicating templates can maintained natural selection increase template length disadvantageous fixed digit copying fidelity however longer molecules expected better replicases iteration longer molecules better replicase function suggested analysed mathematically show efficient replicases can spread provided adsorbed prebiotic mineral surface cellular automaton simulation reveals copying fidelity replicase speed template efficiency increase evolution despite presence molecular parasites essentially reciprocal atruism within-species mutualism surface thus making gradual improvement replicase function plausible
