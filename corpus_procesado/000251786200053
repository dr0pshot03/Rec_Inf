high-fidelity transmission sensory information single cerebellar mossy fibre boutons
understanding transmission sensory information individual synaptic connections requires knowledge properties presynaptic terminals patterns firing evoked sensory stimuli information difficult obtain small size inaccessibility nerve terminals central nervous system show making direct patch clamp recordings vivo cerebellar mossy fibre boutons primary source synaptic input cerebellar cortex sensory stimulation can produce bursts spikes single boutons high instantaneous firing frequencies hz show mossy fibre granule cell synapse exhibits high fidelity transmission frequencies indicating rapid burst excitatory postsynaptic currents underlying sensory evoked response granule cells can driven presynaptic spike burst also demonstrate single mossy fibre can trigger action potential bursts granule cells vitro driven vivo firing patterns findings suggest relay mossy fibre granule cell can act detonator fashion single presynaptic afferent may sufficient transmit sensory message endows cerebellar mossy fibre system remarkable sensitivity high fidelity transmission sensory information
