magnetic field isolated neutron star x-ray cyclotron absorption lines
isolated neutron stars highly magnetized fast-rotating objects form end point stellar evolution directly observable x-ray emission high surface temperatures features x-ray spectra principle reveal presence atmospheres used estimate strength magnetic fields cyclotron process done x-ray binaries almost isolated neutron star spectra observed far appear featureless thermal continua exception 1e1207 refs two deep absorption features detected insufficient definition permit unambiguous interpretation report long x-ray observation object stars spectrum shows three distinct features regularly spaced kev plus fourth feature lower significance kev features vary phase stars rotation logical interpretation features resonant cyclotron absorption allows us calculate magnetic field strength x g assuming absorption arises electrons
