dna synthesis provides driving force accelerate dna unwinding helicase 
helicases molecular motors use energy nucleoside -triphosphate ntp hydrolysis translocate along nucleic acid strand catalyse reactions dna unwinding ring-shaped helicase1 bacteriophage t7 translocates along single-stranded ss dna speed bases per second2; however t7 helicase slows nearly tenfold unwinding strands duplex dna3 report t7 dna polymerase unable catalyse strand displacement dna synthesis can increase unwinding rate base pairs per second bringing helicase similar speeds compared translocation along ssdna helicase rate stimulation depends upon dna synthesis rate rely specific interactions t7 dna polymerase carboxy-terminal residues t7 helicase efficient duplex dna synthesis achieved combined action helicase polymerase strand displacement dna synthesis dna polymerase depends unwinding activity helicase provides ssdna template rapid trapping ssdna bases dna synthesis activity polymerase turn drives helicase move forward duplex dna speeds similar observed along ssdna
