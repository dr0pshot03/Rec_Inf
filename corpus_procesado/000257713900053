bottom-up dependent gating frontal signals early visual cortex 
frontal eye field fef one several cortical regions thought modulate sensory inputs moreover several hypotheses suggest fef can modulate early visual areas presence visual stimulus test bottom-up gating frontal signals microstimulated subregions fef two monkeys measured effects throughout brain functional magnetic resonance imaging activity higher-order visual areas strongly modulated fef stimulation independent visual stimulation contrast fef stimulation induced topographically specific pattern enhancement suppression early visual areas presence visual stimulus modulation strength depended stimulus contrast presence distractors conclude bottom-up activation needed enable top-down modulation early visual cortex stimulus saliency determines strength modulation
