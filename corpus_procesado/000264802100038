priming systemic plant immunity
plants possess inducible systemic defense responses locally infected pathogens bacterial infection results increased accumulation mobile metabolite azelaic acid nine-carbon dicarboxylic acid vascular sap arabidopsis confers local systemic resistance pathogen pseudomonas syringae azelaic acid primes plants accumulate salicylic acid sa known defense signal upon infection mutation azelaic acid induced azi1 gene induced azelaic acid results specific loss systemic immunity triggered pathogen azelaic acid priming sa induction plants furthermore predicted secreted protein azi1 also important generating vascular sap confers disease resistance thus azelaic acid azi1 components plant systemic immunity involved priming defenses
