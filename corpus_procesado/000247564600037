lateral habenula source negative reward signals dopamine neurons
midbrain dopamine neurons key components brains reward system thought guide reward-seeking behaviours- although recent studies shown dopamine neurons respond rewards sensory stimuli predicting reward unclear parts brain provide dopamine neurons signals necessary actions show primate lateral habenula part structure called epithalamus major candidate source negative reward-related signals dopamine neurons recorded activity habenula neurons dopamine neurons rhesus monkeys performing visually guided saccade task positionally biased reward outcomes many habenula neurons excited no-reward-predicting target inhibited reward-predicting target contrast dopamine neurons excited inhibited reward-predicting no-reward-predicting targets respectively time rewarded unrewarded positions reversed habenula dopamine neurons reversed responses bias saccade latency reversed unrewarded trials excitation habenula neurons started earlier inhibition dopamine neurons furthermore weak electrical stimulation lateral habenula elicited strong inhibitions dopamine neurons results suggest inhibitory input lateral habenula plays important role determining reward-related activity dopamine neurons
