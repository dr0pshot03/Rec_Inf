turning recurrent balanced cortical activity
vast majority synaptic connections onto neurons cerebral cortex arise cortical neurons excitatory inhibitory forming local distant recurrent networks although basic theme cortical organization study limited largely theoretical investigations predict local recurrent networks show proportionality balance recurrent excitation inhibition allowing generation stable periods activity- recurrent activity might underlie diverse operations short-term memory modulation neuronal excitability attention generation spontaneous activity sleep- show local cortical circuits indeed operate proportional balance excitation inhibition generated local recurrent connections operation circuits can generate self-sustaining activity can turned synaptic inputs results confirm long-hypothesized role recurrent activity basic operation cerebral cortex
