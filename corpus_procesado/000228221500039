simultaneous tomography diffraction analysis creep damage 
creep damage void nucleation growth limits lifetime components subjected loading high temperatures report combined tomography diffraction experiment using high-energy synchrotron radiation permitted us follow situ void growth microstructure development bulk samples results reveal void growth versus time follows exponential growth law formation large void volumes coincides texture evolution dislocation density reaching steady state creep damage large proportion sample creep life homogeneous damage localization occurs leads rapid failure situ determination void evolution bulk samples allow assessment creep damage metallic materials subsequently lifetime predictions samples components subject high-temperature loading
