disease-corrected haematopoietic progenitors fanconi anaemia induced pluripotent stem cells
generation induced pluripotent stem ips cells enabled derivation patient-specific pluripotent cells provided valuable experimental platforms model human disease patient-specific ips cells also thought hold great therapeutic potential although direct evidence still lacking show correction genetic defect somatic cells fanconi anaemia patients can reprogrammed pluripotency generate patient-specific ips cells cell lines appear indistinguishable human embryonic stem cells ips cells healthy individuals importantly show corrected fanconi-anaemia-specific ips cells can give rise haematopoietic progenitors myeloid erythroid lineages phenotypically normal disease-free data offer proof-of-concept ips cell technology can used generation disease-corrected patient-specific cells potential value cell therapy applications
