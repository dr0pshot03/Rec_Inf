genetic epigenetic mechanisms contribute motor neuron pathfinding
many lines evidence indicate genetically distinct subtypes motor neurons specified development type characteristic properties axon guidance cell-body migration motor neuron subtypes express unique combinations lim-type homeodomain factors may act intrinsic genetic regulators cytoskeletal events mediate cell migration axon navigation both- although experimentally displaced motor neurons can pioneer new routes targets- many cases axons motor neurons complete isolation normal territories passively follow stereotypical pathways dictated environment- investigate nonspecific versus genetically controlled regulation motor connectivity forced motor neurons express ectopically lim gene combination appropriate subgroup innervates axial muscles show genetic alteration sufficient convert cell body settling pattern gene-expression profile axonal projections motor neurons axial subclass nevertheless elevated occupancy axial pathway can override genetic program causing axons project alternative targets
