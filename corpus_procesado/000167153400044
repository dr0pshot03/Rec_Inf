induction direct antimicrobial activity mammalian toll-like receptors 
mammalian innate immune system retains drosophila family homologous toll-like receptors tlrs mediate responses microbial ligands show tlr2 activation leads killing intracellular mycobacterium tuberculosis mouse human macrophages distinct mechanisms mouse macrophages bacterial lipoprotein activation tlr2 leads nitric oxide-dependent killing intracellular tubercle bacilli human monocytes alveolar macrophages pathway nitric oxide-independent thus mammalian tlrs respond drosophila toll receptors microbial ligands also ability activate antimicrobial effector pathways site infection
