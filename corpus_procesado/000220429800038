oxygen isotope constraints sulfur cycle past million years 
oxygen isotopes marine sulfate deltaoso4 measured marine barite show variability past million years including per mil decrease plio-pleistocene near-constant values miocene slightly enriched modern ocean numerical model suggests sea level fluctuations plio-pleistocene glacial cycles affected sulfur cycle reducing area continental shelves increasing oxidative weathering pyrite data also require sulfate concentrations % lower late miocene today
