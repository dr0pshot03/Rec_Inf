bat rat neurons differ theta-frequency resonance despite similar coding space 
bats rats exhibit grid cells medial entorhinal cortex fire visit regular array spatial locations rats grid-cell firing field properties correlate theta-frequency rhythmicity spiking membrane-potential resonance however bat grid cells exhibit theta rhythmic spiking generating controversy role theta rhythm test whether discrepancy reflects differences rhythmicity cellular level performed whole-cell patch recordings entorhinal neurons species record theta-frequency resonance bat neurons showed theta-frequency resonance suggesting grid-cell coding via different mechanisms bats rats lack theta rhythmic contributions grid-cell firing either species
