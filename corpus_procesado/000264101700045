selective erasure fear memory 
memories thought encoded sparsely distributed groups neurons however identifying precise neurons supporting given memory memory trace long-standing challenge shown previously lateral amygdala la neurons increased cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element-binding protein creb preferentially activated fear memory expression suggests selectively recruited memory trace used inducible diphtheria-toxin strategy specifically ablate neurons selectively deleting neurons overexpressing creb similar portion random la neurons learning blocked expression fear memory resulting memory loss robust persistent suggests memory permanently erased results establish causal link specific neuronal subpopulation memory expression thereby identifying critical neurons within memory trace
