orbitofrontal cortex supports behavior learning using inferred cached values 
computational learning theory models propose behavioral control reflects value cached computed stored previous experience inferred estimated fly basis knowledge causal structure environment latter thought depend orbitofrontal cortex yet accounts propose orbitofrontal cortex contributes behavior signaling "economic" value regardless associative basis information found orbitofrontal cortex critical value-based behavior learning value must inferred cached value sufficient orbitofrontal cortex thus fundamental accessing model-based representations environment compute value rather signaling value per se
