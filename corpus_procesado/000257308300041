spatial cooperativity soft glassy flows
amorphous glassy materials diverse nature concentrated emulsions granular materials pastes molecular glasses display complex flow properties intermediate solid liquid root use many applications- general feature systems well documented yet really understood strongly nonlinear nature flow rule relating stresses strain rates use microfluidic velocimetry technique characterize flow thin layers concentrated emulsions confined gaps different thicknesses surfaces different roughnesses find evidence finite size effects flow behaviour absence intrinsic local flow rule contrast classical nonlinearities rheological behaviour amorphous materials show rather simple nonlocal flow rule can account velocity profiles nonlocality dynamics quantified length characteristic cooperativity within flow scales unobservable liquid state lower emulsion concentrations increases concentration jammed state beyond practical importance applications involving thin layers example coatings non locality cooperativity effects parallels behaviour glassy jammed granular systems suggesting possible fundamental universality
