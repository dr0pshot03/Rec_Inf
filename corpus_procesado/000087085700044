mesozoic plate-motion history northeast pacific ocean seismic images subducted farallon slab
high-resolution seismic imaging subducted oceanic slabs become powerful tool reconstructing palaeogeography images can now interpreted quantitatively comparison models general circulation earths mantle use three-dimensional spherical computer model mantle convection show seismic images subducted far-allon plate provide strong evidence mesozoic period low-angle subduction north america period low-angle subduction invoked independently explain rocky mountain uplift far inland plate boundary laramide orogeny computer simulations also allow us locate largely unknown kula-farallon spreading plate boundary location important inferring trajectories suspect terrain across pacific basin
