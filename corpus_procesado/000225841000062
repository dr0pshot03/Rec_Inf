hepcidin regulates cellular iron efflux binding ferroportin inducing internalization
hepcidin peptide hormone secreted liver response iron loading inflammation decreased hepcidin leads tissue iron overload whereas hepcidin overproduction leads hypoferremia anemia inflammation ferroportin iron exporter present surface absorptive enterocytes macrophages hepatocytes placental cells report hepcidin bound ferroportin tissue culture cells binding ferroportin internalized degraded leading decreased export cellular iron posttranslational regulation ferroportin hepcidin may thus complete homeostatic loop: iron regulates secretion hepcidin turn controls concentration ferroportin cell surface
