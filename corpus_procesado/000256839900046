coherent manipulation single spins semiconductors 
past years researchers gained unprecedented control spins solid state considered almost impossible decade ago conceptual practical terms now reality: single spins can isolated initialized coherently manipulated read using electrical optical techniques progress made towards full control quantum states single coupled spins variety semiconductors nanostructures towards understanding mechanisms spins lose coherence systems abilities will allow pioneering investigations fundamental quantum-mechanical processes provide pathways towards applications quantum information processing
