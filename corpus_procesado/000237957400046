scale-free intermittent flow crystal plasticity 
stress crystals irreversibly deform complex dislocation processes intermittently change microscopic material shape isolated slip events underlying processes can revealed statistics discrete changes ultraprecise nanoscale measurements nickel microcrystals directly determined size discrete slip events sizes ranged nearly three orders magnitude exhibited shock-and-aftershock earthquake-like behavior time analysis events reveals power-law scaling number events magnitude scale-free flow show dislocated crystals model system studying scale-free behavior observed many macroscopic systems analogy plate tectonics smooth macroscopic-scale crystalline glide arises spatial time averages disruptive earthquake-like events nanometer scale
