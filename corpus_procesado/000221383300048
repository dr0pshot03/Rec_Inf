reduction particulate air pollution lowers risk heritable mutations mice
urban industrial air pollution can cause elevated heritable mutation rates birds rodents relative importance airborne particulate matter versus gas-phase substances causing genetic effects ambient conditions unclear show high-efficiency particulate-air hepa filtration ambient air significantly reduced heritable mutation rates repetitive dna loci laboratory mice housed outdoors near major highway two integrated steel mills findings implicate exposure airborne particulate matter principal factor contributing elevated mutation rates sentinel mice add accumulating evidence air pollution may pose genetic risks humans wildlife
