multiplex single-molecule interaction profiling dna-barcoded proteins 
contrast advances massively parallel dna sequencing1 high-throughput protein analyses2- often limited ensemble measurements individual analyte purification hence compromised quality cost-effectiveness single-molecule protein detection using optical methods5 limited number spectrally non-overlapping chromophores introduce single-molecular-interaction sequencing smi-seq technology parallel protein interaction profiling leveraging single-molecule advantages dna barcodes attached proteins collectively via ribosome display6 individually via enzymatic conjugation barcoded proteins assayed en masse aqueous solution subsequently immobilized polyacrylamide thin film construct random single-molecule array barcoding dnas amplified situ polymerase colonies polonies7 analysed dna sequencing method allows precise quantification various proteins theoretical maximum array density one million polonies per square millimetre furthermore protein interactions can measured basis statistics colocalized polonies arising barcoding dnas interacting proteins two demanding applications g-protein coupled receptor antibody-binding profiling demonstrated smi-seq enables library versus library screening one-pot assay simultaneously interrogating molecular binding affinity specificity
