multiplex single-molecule interaction profiling dna-barcoded proteins 
contrast advances massively parallel dna sequencing high-throughput protein analyses- often limited ensemble measurements individual analyte purification hence compromised quality cost-effectiveness single-molecule protein detection using optical methods limited number spectrally non-overlapping chromophores introduce single-molecular-interaction sequencing smi-seq technology parallel protein interaction profiling leveraging single-molecule advantages dna barcodes attached proteins collectively via ribosome display individually via enzymatic conjugation barcoded proteins assayed en masse aqueous solution subsequently immobilized polyacrylamide thin film construct random single-molecule array barcoding dnas amplified situ polymerase colonies polonies analysed dna sequencing method allows precise quantification various proteins theoretical maximum array density one million polonies per square millimetre furthermore protein interactions can measured basis statistics colocalized polonies arising barcoding dnas interacting proteins two demanding applications g-protein coupled receptor antibody-binding profiling demonstrated smi-seq enables library versus library screening one-pot assay simultaneously interrogating molecular binding affinity specificity
