canonical wnt signaling regulates organ-specific assembly differentiation cns vasculature
every organ depends blood vessels oxygen nutrients vasculature associated individual organs can structurally molecularly diverse central nervous system cns vasculature consists tightly sealed endothelium forms blood brain barrier whereas blood vessels organs porous wnt7a wnt7b encode two wnt ligands produced neuroepithelium developing cns coincident vascular invasion using genetic mouse models found ligands directly target vascular endothelium cns uses canonical wnt signaling pathway promote formation cns specific differentiation organs vasculature
