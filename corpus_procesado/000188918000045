direct activation bax p53 mediates mitochondrial membrane permeabilization apoptosis
tumor suppressor p53 exerts anti-neoplastic activity primarily induction apoptosis found cytosolic localization endogenous wild-type trans-activation-deficient p53 necessary sufficient apoptosis p53 directly activated proapoptotic bcl protein bax absence proteins permeabilize mitochondria engage apoptotic program p53 also released proapoptotic multidomain proteins bh3-only proteins [proapoptotic bcl family proteins share third bcl homology domain bh3] sequestered bcl-xl transcription-independent activation bax p53 occurred similar kinetics concentrations produced activated bid propose p53 accumulates cytosol can function analogously bh3-only subset proapoptotic bcl proteins activate bax trigger apoptosis
