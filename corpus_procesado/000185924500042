rna molecules stimulate prion protein conversion 
much evidence supports hypothesis infectious agents prion diseases devoid nucleic acid instead composed specific infectious protein protein prpsc seems generated template-induced conformational change normally expressed glycoprotein prpc ref although numerous studies established conversion prpc prpsc central pathogenic event prion disease unknown whether cellular factors prpc might required stimulate efficient prpsc production investigated biochemical amplification protease-resistant prpsc-like protein prpres using modified version protein-misfolding cyclic amplification method report stoichiometric transformation prpc prpres vitro requires specific rna molecules notably whereas mammalian rna preparations stimulate vitro amplification prpres rna preparations invertebrate species findings suggest host-encoded stimulatory rna molecules may role pathogenesis prion disease also provide practical approach improve sensitivity diagnostic techniques based prpres amplification
