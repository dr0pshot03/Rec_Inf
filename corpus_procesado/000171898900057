reprogramming genome function epigenetic inheritance 
cells contain set genes yet extremely diverse appearance functions selective expression repression genes determines specific properties individual cells nevertheless even fully differentiated cell can potentially reprogrammed back totipotency turn results re-differentiation full repertoire adult cells single original cell kind mechanisms regulate exceptional genomic plasticity state totipotency unravelled will enhance ability manipulate stem cells therapeutic purposes
