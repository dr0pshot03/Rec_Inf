dynamics-driven reaction pathway intramolecular rearrangement
critical role traditionally assigned transition states tss minimum energy pathways intrinsic reaction coordinates ircs interpreting organic reactivity interpretation however ignores vibrational kinetic energy effects finite temperature recently shown reactions necessarily follow intermediates along irc report molecular dynamics md simulations show dynamics effects may alter chemical reactions even heterolysis rearrangement protonated pinacolyl alcohol me3c-chme-oh2+ methyl md pathway involves stepwise route c-o bond cleavage followed methyl group migration whereas irc pathway suggests concerted mechanism dynamics effects may lead new interpretations organic reactivity
