human cerebellar activity reflecting acquired internal model new tool 
theories motor control postulate brain uses internal models body control movements accurately internal models neural representations instance arm respond neural command given current position velocity1- previous studies shown cerebellar cortex can acquire internal models motor learning7- human cerebellum involved higher cognitive function12- well motor control propose coherent computational theory phylogenetically newer part cerebellum similarly acquires internal models objects external world human subjects learned use new tool computer mouse novel rotational transformation cerebellar activity measured functional magnetic resonance imaging predicted theory two types activity observed one spread wide areas cerebellum precisely proportional error signal guides acquisition internal models learning confined area near posterior superior fissure remained even learning error levels equalized thus probably reflecting acquired internal model new tool
