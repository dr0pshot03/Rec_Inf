new class gene-termini-associated human rnas suggests novel rna copying mechanism 
small < nucleotide rna srna profiling human cells using various technologies demonstrates unexpected complexity srnas hundreds thousands srna species present1- genetic vitro studies show rnas merely degradation products longer transcripts indeed function125 furthermore profiling rnas including srnas can reveal novel transcripts also make clear predictions existence properties novel biochemical pathways operating cell example srna profiling human cells indicated existence unknown capping mechanism operating cleaved rna2 biochemical component later identified6 show human cells contain novel type srna non-genomically encoded polyu tails presence rnas termini genes specifically ends known mrnas strongly argues presence yet uncharacterized endogenous biochemical pathway cells can copy rna show pathway can operate multiple genes specific enrichment towards transcript-encoding components translational machinery finally show genes also flanked sense polyadenylated srnas likely capped
