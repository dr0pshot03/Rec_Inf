functional proteomics identify cornichon proteins auxiliary subunits ampa receptors
glutamate receptors ampa-subtype ampars together transmembrane ampar regulatory proteins tarps mediate fast excitatory synaptic transmission mammalian brain show proteomic analysis majority ampars rat brain coassembled two members cornichon family transmembrane proteins rather tarps coassembly cornichon homologs affects ampars two ways: cornichons increase surface expression ampars alter channel gating markedly slowing deactivation desensitization kinetics results demonstrate cornichons intrinsic auxiliary subunits native ampars provide previously unknown molecular determinants glutamatergic neurotransmission central nervous system
