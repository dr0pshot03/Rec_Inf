piddosome protein complex implicated activation caspase response genotoxic stress 
apoptosis triggered activation initiator caspases upon complex-mediated clustering inactive zymogen occurs caspase activating apoptosome complex likewise caspase- involved stress-induced apoptosis recruited large protein complex molecular composition remains elusive show activation caspase occurs complex contains death domain containing protein pidd whose expression induced p53 adaptor protein raidd increased pidd expression resulted spontaneous activation caspase sensitization apoptosis genotoxic stimuli pidd functions p53-mediated apoptosis complex assembled pidd caspase likely regulate apoptosis induced genotoxins
