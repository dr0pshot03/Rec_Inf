prions believed infectious self-propagating polymers otherwise soluble host-encoded proteins concept now strongly supported recent findings amyloid fibrils recombinant prion proteins yeast- podospora anserina mammals can induce prion phenotypes corresponding hosts however structural basis prion infectivity remains largely elusive acquisition atomic resolution structural properties amyloid fibrils represents largely unsolved technical challenge het-s prion protein p anserina contains carboxy-terminal prion domain comprising residues amyloid fibrils het-s necessary sufficient induction propagation prion infectivity used fluorescence studies quenched hydrogen exchange nmr solid-state nmr determine sequence-specific positions amyloid fibril secondary structure elements het-s approach revealed four beta-strands constituted two pseudo-repeat sequences forming beta-strand-turn-beta strand motif using structure-based mutagenesis approach show conformation functional infectious entity het-s prion results correlate distinct structural elements prion infectivity
