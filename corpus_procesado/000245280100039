plastic deformation recovery freestanding nanocrystalline aluminum gold thin films
nanocrystalline metals lack intragranular dislocation sources leads plastic deformation mechanisms substantially differ coarse-grained metals however irrespective grain size plastic deformation considered irrecoverable show experimentally plastically deformed nanocrystalline aluminum gold films grain sizes nanometers nanometers respectively recovered substantial fraction % plastic strain unloading recovery time dependent expedited higher temperatures furthermore stress-strain characteristics next loading remained almost unchanged strain recovery complete observations two dissimilar face-centered cubic metals suggest strain recovery might characteristic metals similar grain sizes crystalline packing
