identification synergistic signals initiating inner ear development 
tissue manipulation experiments amphibians years ago showed induction inner ear requires two signals: mesodermal signal followed neural signal however molecules mediating process remained elusive present evidence mesodermal initiation otic development higher vertebrates show mesoderm can direct terminal differentiation inner ear rostral ectoderm furthermore demonstrate synergistic interactions extracellular polypeptide ligands fgf- wnt-8c mediators mesodermal neural signals respectively initiating inner ear development
