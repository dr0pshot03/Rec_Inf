cortex driven weak synchronously active thalamocortical synapses
sensory stimuli reach brain via thalamocortical projection group axons thought among powerful neocortex surprisingly axons account similar % synapses onto cortical neurons thalamocortical pathway might thus achieve effectiveness via high-efficacy thalamocortical synapses via amplification within cortical layer rat somatosensory cortex measured vivo excitatory postsynaptic potential evoked single synaptic connection found thalamocortical synapses low efficacy convergent inputs however numerous synchronous intracortical amplification required results suggest mechanism cortical activation thalamic input alone can drive cortex
