visualization dna replication individual epstein-barr virus episomes 
duplication mammalian genome organized event limited information precision duplication program specific genetic loci developed approach allows dna replication events visualized individual dna molecules studying latent replication epstein-barr virus episomes show different initiation sites used commence dna replication specific portion viral genome zone whereas termination seem genomically defined conclude initiation zones pausing sites major organizers duplication program initiation fork progression termination replication can vary molecule
