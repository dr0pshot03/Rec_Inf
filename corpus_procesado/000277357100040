altered histone acetylation associated age-dependent memory impairment mice
human life span increases number people suffering cognitive decline rising dramatically mechanisms underlying age-associated memory impairment however understood show memory disturbances aging brain mouse associated altered hippocampal chromatin plasticity learning aged mice display specific deregulation histone h4 lysine h4k12 acetylation fail initiate hippocampal gene expression program associated memory consolidation restoration physiological h4k12 acetylation reinstates expression learning-induced genes leads recovery cognitive abilities data suggest deregulated h4k12 acetylation may represent early biomarker impaired genome-environment interaction aging mouse brain
