amacrine-signaled loss intrinsic axon growth ability retinal ganglion cells
central nervous system cns loses ability regenerate early development known retina long served simple model system study cns regeneration show amacrine cells signal neonatal rat retina[ ganglion cells rgcs undergo profound apparently irreversible loss intrinsic axon growth ability concurrently retinal maturation triggers rgcs greatly increase dendritic growth ability results suggest adult cns neurons fail regenerate cns glial inhibition also loss intrinsic axon growth ability
