safeguards cell cooperation mouse embryogenesis shown genome-wide cheater screen
ensuring cooperation among formerly autonomous cells central challenge evolution multicellular organisms one solution monoclonality option still leaves room exploitative behavior eliminate genetic epigenetic variability therefore hypothesized embryonic development must protected robust regulatory mechanisms prevent aberrant clones superseding wild-type cells using genome-wide screen murine induced pluripotent stem cells identified network genes centered p53 topoisomerase olfactory receptors whose down-regulation caused cells replace wild-type cells vitro mouse embryo-without perturbing normal development genes thus appear fulfill unexpected role fostering cell cooperation
