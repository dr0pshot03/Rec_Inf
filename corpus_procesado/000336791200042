liquid flow along solid surface reversibly alters interfacial chemistry 
nature aqueous solutions often move collectively along solid surfaces example raindrops falling ground rivers flowing riverbeds however influence motion water-surface interfacial chemistry unclear work combine surface-specific sum frequency generation spectroscopy microfluidics show immersed calcium fluoride fused silica surfaces flow leads reversible modification surface charge subsequent realignment interfacial water molecules obtaining equivalent effects static conditions requires substantial change bulk solution ph ph units demonstrating coupling flow chemistry marked flow-induced variations interfacial chemistry substantially affect understanding modeling chemical processes immersed surfaces
