disruption cftr gene produces model cystic fibrosis newborn pigs
almost two decades cftr identified gene responsible cystic fibrosis cf still lack answers many questions pathogenesis disease remains incurable mice disrupted cftr gene greatly facilitated cf studies mutant mice develop characteristic manifestations human cf including abnormalities pancreas lung intestine liver organs pigs share many anatomical physiological features humans generated pigs targeted disruption cftr alleles newborn pigs lacking cftr exhibited defective chloride transport developed meconium ileus exocrine pancreatic destruction focal biliary cirrhosis replicating abnormalities seen newborn humans cf pig model may provide opportunities address persistent questions cf pathogenesis accelerate discovery strategies prevention treatment
