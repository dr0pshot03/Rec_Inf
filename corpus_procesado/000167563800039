sonic hedgehog control size shape midbrain pattern formation
little known patterns cell types organized form brain structures appropriate size shape study process employed vivo electroporation midbrain development create ectopic sources sonic: hedgehog signaling molecule previously shown specify different neuronal cell types concentration-dependent manner vitro provide direct evidence sonic hedgehog source can control pattern distance brain development demonstrate sire shape orientation cell populations produced depend geometry morphogen source thus single regulatory molecule can coordinate tissue size shape cell-type identity brain development
