enhancement superconductivity pressure-driven competition electronic order 
finding ways achieve higher values transition temperature t-c superconductors remains great challenge superconducting phase often one several competing types electronic order including antiferromagnetism charge density waves- emerging trend documented heavy-fermion organic conductors maximum t-c superconductivity occurs external conditions cause critical temperature competing order go zero recently competition found multilayer copper oxide high-temperature superconductors htscs3- possess two crystallographically inequivalent cuo2 planes unit cell however whether competing electronic state can suppressed enhance t-c htscs remains open question show pressure-driven phase competition leads unusual two-step enhancement t-c optimally doped trilayer bi2sr2ca2cu3o10+delta bi2223 find t-c first increases pressure decreases passing maximum unexpectedly t-c increases pressure raised critical value around gpa surpassing first maximum presence critical pressure manifestation crossover competing order superconductivity inner three cuo2 planes suggest increase higher pressures occurs result competition pairing phase ordering different cuo2 planes
