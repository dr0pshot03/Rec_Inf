defect pair separation controlling step homogeneous ice melting 
heated ice melts liquid water although practice process tends heterogeneous can occur homogeneously inside bulk ice thermally induced homogeneous melting solids fairly well understood involves formation growth melting nuclei- case water resilient hydrogen bonds render ice melting complex know first defects appearing homogeneous ice melting pairs five-and seven-membered rings appear disappear repeatedly randomly space time crystalline ice structure- however accumulation defects form aggregate nearly additive energy results steep free energy increase suppresses growth report molecular dynamics simulations homogeneous ice melting identify crucial first step formation rather spatial separation defect pair find separated defect pair-either interstitial vacancy v defect pair frenkel pair l d defect pair bjerrum pair entropically stabilized entangled state defects threefold hydrogen-bond coordination persist grow thereby prepare system subsequent rapid melting
