magnetic order close superconductivity iron-based layered lao-xfxfeas systems
following discovery long range antiferromagnetic order parent compounds high transition temperature high tc copper oxides efforts understand role magnetism superconductivity occurs mobile electrons holes doped antiferromagnetic parent compounds superconductivity newly discovered rare earth iron based oxide systems rofeas r rare earth metal also arises either electron- hole doping non superconducting parent compounds parent material laofeas metallic shows anomalies near k resistivity d c magnetic susceptibility although optical conductivity theoretical calculations suggest laofeas exhibits spin density wave sdw instability suppressed doping electrons induce superconductivity direct evidence sdw order report neutron scattering experiments demonstrate laofeas undergoes abrupt structural distortion k changing symmetry tetragonal space group p4/ nmm monoclinic space group p112/ n low temperatures similar k develops long range sdw type antiferromagnetic order small moment simple magnetic structure doping system fluorine suppresses magnetic order structural distortion favour superconductivity therefore like high tc copper oxides superconducting regime iron based materials occurs close proximity long range ordered antiferromagnetic ground state
