intracellular calcium stores regulate activity-dependent neuropeptide release dendrites 
information neurons flows synapses dendrites cell body soma finally along axon spikes electrical activity will ultimately release neurotransmitters nerve terminals however dendrites many neurons also secretory role transmitting information back afferent nerve terminals1- central nervous system neurons spikes originate soma can travel along dendrites well axons may thus elicit secretion compartments1 show hypothalamic oxytocin neurons agents mobilize intracellular ca2+ induce oxytocin release dendrites without increasing electrical activity cell body without inducing secretion nerve terminals conversely electrical activity cell bodies can cause secretion oxytocin nerve terminals little release dendrites finally mobilization intracellular ca2+ can also prime releasable pool oxytocin dendrites priming action makes dendritic oxytocin available release response subsequent spike activity priming persists prolonged period changing nature interactions oxytocin neurons neighbours
