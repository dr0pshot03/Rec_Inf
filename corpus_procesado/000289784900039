global trends wind speed wave height
studies climate change typically consider measurements predictions temperature extended periods time climate however much temperature oceans changes wind speed surface gravity waves generated winds play important role used year database calibrated validated satellite altimeter measurements investigate global changes oceanic wind speed wave height period find general global trend increasing values wind speed lesser degree wave height period rate increase greater extreme events compared mean condition
