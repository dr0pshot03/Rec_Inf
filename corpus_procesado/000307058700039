non-centrosymmetric cylindrical micelles unidirectional growth 
although solution self-assembly block copolymers bcps represents one promising approaches creation nanoparticles soft matter formation non-centrosymmetric nanostructures shape anisotropy remains major challenge combination crystallization-driven self-assembly crystalline-coil bcps solution selective micelle corona cross-linking created short nanometers monodisperse cylindrical seed micelles grow unidirectionally nanostructures grow form long non-centrosymmetric cylindrical a-b a-b-c block co-micelles upon addition bcps also illustrate formation amphiphilic cylindrical a-b-c block co-micelles spontaneously self-assemble hierarchical star-shaped supermicelle architectures diameter micrometers method described enables rational creation non-centrosymmetric high aspect ratio colloidally stable core-shell nanoparticles manner now restricted biological domain
