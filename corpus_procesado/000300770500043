experimental demonstration topological error correction
scalable quantum computing can achieved quantum bits manipulated fault-tolerant fashion topological error correction-a method combines topological quantum computation quantum error correction-has highest known tolerable error rate local architecture technique makes use cluster states topological properties requires nearest-neighbour interactions report experimental demonstration topological error correction eight-photon cluster state show correlation can protected single error quantum bit also quantum bits simultaneously subjected errors equal probability effective error rate can significantly reduced work demonstrates viability topological error correction fault-tolerant quantum information processing
