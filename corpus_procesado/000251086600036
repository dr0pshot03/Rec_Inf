end-to-end stacking liquid crystal condensation base pair dna duplexes
short complementary b-form dna oligomers base pairs length found exhibit nematic columnar liquid crystal phases even though duplexes lack shape anisotropy required liquid crystal ordering structural study shows phases produced end-to-end adhesion consequent stacking duplex oligomers polydisperse anisotropic rod-shaped aggregates can order liquid crystals upon cooling mixed solutions short dna oligomers small fraction dna present complementary duplex-forming oligomers phase-separate liquid crystal droplets leaving unpaired single strands isotropic solution chemical environment oligomer ligation possible ordering condensation provide autocatalytic link whereby complementarity promotes extended polymerization complementary oligomers
