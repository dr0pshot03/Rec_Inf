ovulated oocytes adult mice derive non-circulating germ cells
decades research reproductive biology led generally accepted belief female mammals surviving germ cells enter meiosis end fetal development result postnatal ovary harbours limited supply oocytes replenished regenerated lost injury disease however recent reports challenged view suggesting instead oocyte production maintained continual seeding ovary circulating bone-marrow-derived germ cells test directly physiological relevance circulating cells female fertility established transplantation parabiotic mouse models assess capacity circulating bone marrow cells generate ovulated oocytes steady state induced damage studies showed evidence bone marrow cells normally circulating cells contribute formation mature ovulated oocytes instead cells travelled ovary bloodstream exhibited properties characteristic committed blood leukocytes
