long-term phenotypic evolution bacteria 
many decades comparative analyses protein sequences structures used investigate fundamental principles molecular evolution contrast relatively little known long-term evolution species phenotypic genetic properties represents important gap understanding evolution exactly proprieties play key roles natural selection adaptation diverse environments perform comparative analysis bacterial growth gene deletion phenotypes using hundreds genome-scale metabolic models overall bacterial phenotypic evolution can described two-stage process rapid initial phenotypic diversification followed slow long-term exponential divergence observed average divergence trend approximately similar fractions phenotypic properties changing per unit time continues billions years experimentally confirm predicted divergence trend using phenotypic profiles diverse bacterial species across growth conditions analysis suggests long evolutionary distances gene essentiality significantly conserved ability utilize different nutrients synthetic lethality significantly less conserved also find although rapid phenotypic evolution sometimes observed within species transition high low phenotypic similarity occurs primarily genus level
