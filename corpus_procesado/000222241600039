molecular photodiode system can switch photocurrent direction 
prepared molecular photodiode system photocurrent direction can switched choosing wavelength irradiating light molecular system composed two types helical peptides carry different chromophores different directions dipole moments immobilized gold mixed self-assembled monolayer generated anodic photocurrent one two chromophores photoexcited whereas photocurrent switched cathodic chromophore photoexcited opposite current response arises dipole moment helical peptide accelerates electron transfer direction
