atom-chip-based generation entanglement quantum metrology 
atom chips provide versatile quantum laboratory experiments ultracold atomic gases used diverse experiments involving low-dimensional quantum gases cavity quantum electrodynamics atom-surface interactions chip-based atomic clocks interferometers however severe limitation atom chips techniques control atomic interactions generate entanglement experimentally available far techniques enable chip-based studies entangled many-body systems key prerequisite atom chip applications quantum simulations quantum information processing quantum metrology report experimental generation multi-particle entanglement atom chip controlling elastic collisional interactions state-dependent potential use technique generate spin-squeezed states two-component bose-einstein condensate states useful resource quantum metrology observed reduction spin noise +/ db combined spin coherence implies four-partite entanglement condensate atoms used improve interferometric measurement +/ db standard quantum limit data show good agreement dynamical multi-mode simulation allow us reconstruct wigner function spin-squeezed condensate techniques reported directly applied chip-based atomic clocks currently development
