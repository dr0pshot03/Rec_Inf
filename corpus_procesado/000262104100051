broadband invisibility non-euclidean cloaking
invisibility negative refraction applications transformation optics material device performs coordinate transformation electromagnetic fields device creates illusion light propagates empty flat space whereas physical space light bent around hidden interior seems run backward space time previous proposals invisibility require materials extreme properties show transformation optics curved non euclidean space surface virtual sphere relax requirements can lead invisibility broad band spectrum
