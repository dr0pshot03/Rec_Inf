bardeen-cooper-schrieffer theory superconductivity electrons form cooper pairs interaction mediated vibrations underlying crystal structure like lattice vibrations antiferromagnetic fluctuations can also produce attractive interaction creating cooper pairs though spin angular momentum properties different conventional superconductors interactions implicated two disparate classes materials-the copper oxides set ce u-based compounds transition temperatures differ nearly two orders magnitude raises question whether common pairing mechanism applies pucoga5 transition temperature intermediate classes therefore may bridge extremes report measurements nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate knight shift pucoga5 demonstrate unconventional superconductor properties expected antiferromagnetically mediated superconductivity scaling relaxation rates among materials feature exhibited knight shifts establishes antiferromagnetic fluctuations likely mechanism unconventional superconductivity suggests related classes exotic superconductors may yet discovered
