extreme oxygen sensitivity electronic properties carbon nanotubes
electronic properties single-walled carbon nanotubes shown extremely sensitive chemical environment exposure air oxygen dramatically influences nanotubes electrical resistance thermoelectric power local density states determined transport measurements scanning tunneling spectroscopy electronic parameters can reversibly tuned surprisingly small concentrations adsorbed gases apparently semiconducting nanotube can converted apparent metal exposure results although demonstrating nanotubes find use sensitive chemical gas sensors likewise indicate many supposedly intrinsic properties measured as-prepared nanotubes may severely compromised extrinsic air exposure effects
