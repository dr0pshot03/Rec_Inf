negative regulation toll-like receptor signaling nf-kappa b p50 ubiquitination blockade
toll-like receptors tlrs trigger production inflammatory cytokines shape adaptive innate immunity pathogens report identification b cell leukemia bcl essential negative regulator tlr signaling blocking ubiquitination p50 member nuclear factor nf-kb family bcl stabilizes p50 complex inhibits gene transcription consequence bcl--deficient mice cells found hypersensitive tlr activation unable control responses lipopolysaccharides thus p50 ubiquitination blockade bcl limits strength tlr responses maintains innate immune homeostasis findings indicate p50 ubiquitination pathway can selectively targeted control deleterious inflammatory diseases
