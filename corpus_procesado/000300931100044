pollinator-mediated selection flower color allele drives reinforcement
reinforcement process reduced hybrid fitness generates selection favoring evolution stronger prezygotic reproductive barriers emerging species using common-garden field experiments quantified strength reinforcing selection nature demonstrating strong selection favoring allele conferring increased pigment intensity plant phlox drummondii areas sympatry closely related species phlox cuspidata incomplete hybrid sterility two species generates selection traits decrease interspecies hybridization contrast selection locus undetectable absence p cuspidata demonstrate reinforcing selection generated nonrandom pollinator movement pollinators move less frequently intensely pigmented p drummondii p cuspidata lightly pigmented p drummondii p cuspidata
