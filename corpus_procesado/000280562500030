noncoding variant phenotype via sort1 1p13 cholesterol locus 
recent genome-wide association studies gwass identified locus chromosome 1p13 strongly associated plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ldl-c myocardial infarction mi humans show series studies human cohorts human-derived hepatocytes common noncoding polymorphism 1p13 locus rs12740374 creates c/ebp ccaat/enhancer binding protein transcription factor binding site alters hepatic expression sort1 gene small interfering rna sirna knockdown viral overexpression mouse liver demonstrate sort1 alters plasma ldl-c low-density lipoprotein vldl particle levels modulating hepatic vldl secretion thus provide functional evidence novel regulatory pathway lipoprotein metabolism suggest modulation pathway may alter risk mi humans also demonstrate common noncoding dna variants identified gwass can directly contribute clinical phenotypes
