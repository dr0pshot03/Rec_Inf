rapid magnetic reconnection earths magnetosphere mediated whistler waves 
magnetic reconnection crucial role variety plasma environments1- providing mechanism fast release stored magnetic energy reconnection plasma forms magnetic nozzle: like nozzle hose rate controlled fast plasma can flow nozzle traditional picture reconnection unable explain satisfactorily short timescales associated energy release flow mediated heavy ions slow resultant velocity recent theoretical work4- suggested energy release instead mediated electrons waves called whistlers move much faster given perturbation magnetic field smaller mass moreover whistler velocity associated plasma velocity increase nozzle becomes narrower narrower nozzle therefore longer reduces total plasma flow-the outflow independent size nozzle report observations demonstrating reconnection magnetosphere driven whistlers good agreement theoretical predictions
