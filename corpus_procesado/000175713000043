premature aging mice deficient dna repair transcription 
one factors postulated drive aging process accumulation dna damage provide strong support hypothesis describing studies mice mutation xpd gene encoding dna helicase functions repair transcription mutated human disorder trichothiodystrophy ttd ttd mice found exhibit many symptoms premature aging including osteoporosis kyphosis osteosclerosis early greying cachexia infertility reduced life-span ttd mice carrying additional mutation xpa enhances dna repair defect showed greatly accelerated aging phenotype correlated increased cellular sensitivity oxidative dna damage hypothesize aging ttd mice caused unrepaired dna damage compromises transcription leading functional inactivation critical genes enhanced apoptosis
