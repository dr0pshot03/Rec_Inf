domain architecture pyruvate carboxylase biotin-dependent multifunctional enzyme
biotin-dependent multifunctional enzymes carry metabolically important carboxyl group transfer reactions potential targets treatment obesity type diabetes enzymes use tethered biotin cofactor carry activated carboxyl group distantly spaced active sites mechanism transfer remained poorly understood report complete structure pyruvate carboxylase angstroms resolution shows domain arrangement structure combined mutagenic analysis shows intermediate transfer occurs active sites separate polypeptide chains addition domain rearrangements associated activator binding decrease distance active-site pairs providing mechanism allosteric activation description provides insight function biotin-dependent enzymes presents new paradigm multifunctional enzyme catalysis
