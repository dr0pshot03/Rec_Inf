although many metazoan enzymes add remove specific modifications histone proteins essential transcriptional regulators functional significance posttranslational modifications histone proteins well understood show drosophila point mutation lysine histone h3 h3-k27 fails repress transcription genes normally repressed polycomb repressive complex prc2 methyltransferase modifies h3-k27 moreover differentiated h3-k27 mutant cells show homeotic transformations like seen prc2 mutant cells taken together analyses demonstrate h3-k27 crucial physiological substrate prc2 modifies polycomb repression
