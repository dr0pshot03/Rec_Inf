retinoid signaling determines germ cell fate mice
germ cells mouse embryo can develop oocytes spermatogonia depending molecular cues identified found retinoic acid produced mesonephroi sexes causes germ cells ovary enter meiosis inititate oogenesis meiosis retarded fetal testis action retinoid-degrading enzyme cyp26b1 ultimately leading spermatogenesis testes cyp26b1-knockout mouse embryos germ cells enter meiosis precociously normal ovary thus precise regulation retinoid levels fetal gonad development provides molecular control mechanism specifies germ cell fate
