inhibition dominates sensory responses awake cortex 
activity cerebral cortex thought depend precise relationship synaptic excitation inhibition- visual cortex particular intracellular measurements related response selectivity coordinated increases excitation inhibition- measurements however made anaesthesia strongly influences cortical state therefore sensory processing- synaptic activity evoked visual stimulation wakefulness unknown measured visually evoked responses-and underlying synaptic conductances-in visual cortex anaesthetized awake mice anaesthesia responses elicited large region visual space prolonged wakefulness responses spatially selective much briefer whole-cell patch-clamp recordings synaptic conductances showed difference synaptic inhibition two conditions anaesthesia inhibition tracked excitation amplitude spatial selectivity contrast wakefulness inhibition much stronger excitation extremely broad spatial selectivity conclude wakefulness cortical responses visual stimulation dominated synaptic inhibition restricting spatial spread temporal persistence neural activity results provide direct glimpse synaptic mechanisms control sensory responses awake cortex
