dynamics singularities constrained elastic plate 
large deformations thin elastic plates usually lead formation singular structures either linear1- ridges pointlike5- developable cones structures thought generic crumpled plates35 although investigated quantitatively simplified geometries1-- previous studies9- also shown large number singularities generated successive instabilities study experimentally numerically generic situation plate initially bent one direction cylindrical arch deformed direction load applied centre induces generation pairs singularities; study position dynamics corresponding resistance plate deformation solve numerically equations describing large deformations plates; developable cones predicted quantitative agreement experiments use geometrical arguments predict observed patterns assuming energy plate given energy singularities
