dynamics singularities constrained elastic plate 
large deformations thin elastic plates usually lead formation singular structures either linear- ridges pointlike- developable cones structures thought generic crumpled plates although investigated quantitatively simplified geometries-- previous studies- also shown large number singularities generated successive instabilities study experimentally numerically generic situation plate initially bent one direction cylindrical arch deformed direction load applied centre induces generation pairs singularities study position dynamics corresponding resistance plate deformation solve numerically equations describing large deformations plates developable cones predicted quantitative agreement experiments use geometrical arguments predict observed patterns assuming energy plate given energy singularities
