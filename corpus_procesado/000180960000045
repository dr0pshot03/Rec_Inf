control regulatory t cell development transcription factor foxp3 
regulatory t cells engage maintenance immunological self-tolerance actively suppressing self-reactive lymphocytes little known however molecular mechanism development show foxp3 encodes transcription factor genetically defective autoimmune inflammatory syndrome humans mice specifically expressed naturally arising cd4+ regulatory t cells furthermore retroviral gene transfer foxp3 converts naive t cells toward regulatory t cell phenotype similar naturally occurring cd4+ regulatory t cells thus foxp3 key regulatory gene development regulatory t cells
