condition-dependent signalling genetic variation stalk-eyes flies 
handicap models sexual selection predict male sexual ornaments strong condition-dependent expression allows females evaluate male genetic quality1- number previous experiments demonstrated heightened condition-dependence sexual ornaments response environmental stress6- show genetic variation underlies response environmental stress variable food quality sexual ornament male eye span stalk-eyed fly cyrtodiopsis dalmanni male genotypes develop large eye span conditions whereas genotypes progressively reduce eye span conditions deteriorate several non-sexual traits female eye span male female wing length also show genetic variation condition-dependent expression genetic response entirely explained scaling body size contrast male sexual ornament still reveals genetic variation response environmental stress accounting differences body size results strongly support hypothesis female mate choice yields genetic benefits offspring
