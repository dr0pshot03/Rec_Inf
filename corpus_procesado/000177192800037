plant development: regulation protein degradation
many aspects eukaryotic development depend regulated protein degradation ubiquitin-proteasome pathway highly conserved pathway promotes covalent attachment ubiquitin protein substrates sequential action three enzymes called ubiquitin-activating enzyme e1 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme e2 ubiquitin-protein ligase e3 ubiquitinated proteins targeted degradation s proteasome recent studies also shown ubiquitin-related protein rub/nedd8 proteasome-related cop9 signalosome complex cooperate ubiquitin-proteasome pathway promote protein degradation components conserved three eukaryotic kingdoms however known targets pathway plants developmental processes regulate specific plant kingdom
