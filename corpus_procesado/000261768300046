experience moving visual stimuli drives early development cortical direction selectivity
onset vision occurs neural circuits visual cortex immature lacking full complement connections response selectivity defines functional maturity direction selective responses particularly vulnerable effects early visual deprivation remains unclear stimulus driven neural activity guides emergence cortical direction selectivity report observations motion training protocol allowed us monitor impact experience development direction selective responses visually naive ferrets using intrinsic signal imaging techniques found training single axis motion induced rapid emergence direction columns confined cortical regions preferentially activated training stimulus using two photon calcium imaging techniques found single neurons visually naive animals exhibited weak directional biases lacked strong local coherence spatial organization direction preference evident mature animals training moving stimulus flashed stimulus strengthened direction selective responses individual neurons preferentially reversed direction biases neurons deviated neighbours effects contributed increase local coherence conclude early experience moving visual stimuli drives rapid emergence direction-selective responses visual cortex
