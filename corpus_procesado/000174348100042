rick/rip2/cardiak mediates signalling receptors innate adaptive immune systems 
immune system consists two evolutionarily different closely related responses innate immunity adaptive immunity responses characteristic receptors-toll-like receptors tlrs innate immunity antigen-specific receptors adaptive immunity show caspase recruitment domain card-containing serine/threonine kinase rip2 also known rick cardiak cck ripk21- transduces signals receptors immune responses rip2 recruited tlr2 signalling complexes ligand stimulation moreover cytokine production rip2-deficient cells reduced stimulation tlrs lipopolysaccharide peptidoglycan double-stranded rna bacterial dna indicating rip2 downstream tlr2// tlr9 rip2-deficient cells also hyporesponsive signalling interleukin il- il- receptors deficient signalling nod proteins-molecules also implicated innate immune response furthermore rip2-deficient t cells showed severely reduced nf-kappab activation il- production proliferation t-cell-receptor tcr engagement impaired differentiation t-helper subtype th1 cells indicating rip2 required optimal tcr signalling t-cell differentiation rip2 therefore signal transducer integrator signals innate adaptive immune systems
