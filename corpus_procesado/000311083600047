rab32-dependent pathway contributes salmonella typhi host restriction
unlike salmonellae intracellular bacterial human pathogen salmonella typhi exhibits strict host specificity molecular bases restriction unknown found expression single type iii secretion system effector protein broad-host salmonella typhimurium allowed salmonella typhi survive replicate within macrophages tissues mice nonpermissive host effector proteolytically targeted rab32 controls traffic lysosome-related organelles conjunction components biogenesis lysosome-related organelle complexes blocs rna interference-mediated depletion rab32 essential component bloc complex sufficient allow s typhi survive within mouse macrophages furthermore s typhi able survive macrophages mice defective bloc components
