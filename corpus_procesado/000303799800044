mitochondrial dna escapes autophagy causes inflammation heart failure 
heart failure leading cause morbidity mortality industrialized countries although infection microorganisms involved development heart failure cases inflammation implicated pathogenesis heart failure1 however mechanisms responsible initiating integrating inflammatory responses within heart remain poorly defined mitochondria evolutionary endosymbionts derived bacteria contain dna similar bacterial dna2- mitochondria damaged external haemodynamic stress degraded autophagy/lysosome systemin cardiomyocytes5 show mitochondrial dna escapes autophagy cell-autonomously leads toll-like receptor tlr -mediated inflammatory responses cardiomyocytes capable inducing myocarditis dilated cardiomyopathy cardiac-specific deletion lysosomal deoxyribonuclease dnase ii showed cardiac phenotypes baseline conditions increased mortality caused severe myocarditis dilated cardiomyopathy days treatment pressure overload early pathogenesis dnase ii-deficient hearts showed infiltration inflammatory cells increased messenger rna expression inflammatory cytokines accumulation mitochondrial dna deposits autolysosomes myocardium administration inhibitory oligodeoxynucleotides tlr9 known activated bacterial dna6 ablation tlr9 attenuated development cardiomyopathy dnase ii-deficient mice furthermore tlr9 ablation improved pressure overload-induced cardiac dysfunction inflammation even mice wild-type dnase2a alleles data provide new perspectives mechanism genesis chronic inflammation failing hearts
