nascent transcript sequencing visualizes transcription nucleotide resolution 
recent studies transcription revealed level complexity previously appreciated even years ago intricate use post-initiation control mass production rapidly degraded transcripts dissection pathways requires strategies precisely following transcripts produced present approach native elongating transcript sequencing net-seq based deep sequencing ends nascent transcripts associated rna polymerase monitor transcription nucleotide resolution application net-seq saccharomyces cerevisiae reveals although promoters generally capable divergent transcription rpd3s deacetylation complex enforces strong directionality promoters suppressing antisense transcript initiation studies also reveal pervasive polymerase pausing backtracking throughout body transcripts average pause density shows prominent peaks first four nucleosomes peak location occurring good agreement vitro biophysical measurements thus nucleosome-induced pausing represents major barrier transcriptional elongation vivo
