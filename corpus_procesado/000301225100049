unique processing period high excitation/inhibition balance adult-born neurons 
adult dentate gyrus generates new granule cells gcs develop several weeks integrate preexisting network although adult hippocampal neurogenesis implicated learning memory specific role new gcs remains unclear examined whether immature adult-born neurons contribute information encoding combining calcium imaging electrophysiology acute slices found weak afferent activity recruits mature gcs activating substantial proportion immature neurons different activation thresholds dictated enhanced excitation/inhibition balance transiently expressed immature gcs immature gcs exhibit low input specificity switches time toward highly specific responsiveness therefore activity patterns entering dentate gyrus can undergo differential decoding heterogeneous population gcs originated different times
