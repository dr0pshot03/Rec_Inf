deep crust-mantle boundary asteroid vesta 
asteroid vesta recently found two large impact craters near south pole exposing subsurface material modelling suggested surface material northern hemisphere vesta came depth kilometres whereas exposed southern material comes depth kilometres large amounts olivine mantle seen suggesting outer kilometres mainly igneous crust analyse data vesta conclude crust-mantle boundary moho deeper kilometres
