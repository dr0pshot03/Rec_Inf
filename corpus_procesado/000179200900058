structure protein universe genome evolution 
despite practically unlimited number possible protein sequences number basic shapes proteins fold seems finite also relatively small probably folds existence moreover distribution proteins among folds highly non-homogeneous folds superfamilies extremely abundant rare protein folds families encoded diverse genomes show similar size distributions notable mathematical properties also extend number connections domains multidomain proteins distributions follow asymptotic power laws identified wide variety biological physical systems typically associated scale-free networks findings suggest genome evolution driven extremely general mechanisms based preferential attachment principle
