vivo architecture action bacterial structural maintenance chromosome proteins 
smc structural maintenance chromosome proteins act ubiquitously chromosome processing escherichia coli smc complex mukbef plays roles chromosome segregation organization used single-molecule millisecond multicolor fluorescence microscopy live bacteria reveal dimer dimeric fluorescent mukbef molecules acts minimal functional unit average complexes accumulated "spots" one three discrete chromosome-associated regions cell formed higher-order structures functional mukbef within spots exchanged freely diffusing complexes rate one complex every seconds reactions requiring adenosine triphosphate atp hydrolysis thus functioning pairs mukbef complexes may undergo multiple cycles atp hydrolysis without released dna analogous behavior well-characterized molecular motors
