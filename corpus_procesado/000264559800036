greatly expanded tropical warm pool weakened hadley circulation early pliocene 
pliocene warm interval difficult explain reconstructed latitudinal distribution sea surface temperature around million years ago early pliocene reconstruction shows meridional temperature gradient equator subtropics greatly reduced implying vast poleward expansion ocean tropical warm pool corroborating evidence indicates pacific temperature contrast equator degrees n evolved similar degrees c million years ago similar degrees c today meridional warm pool expansion evidently enormous impacts pliocene climate including slowdown atmospheric hadley circulation el nino-like conditions equatorial region ultimately sustaining climate state weak tropical sea surface temperature gradients may require additional mechanisms ocean heat uptake enhanced ocean vertical mixing
