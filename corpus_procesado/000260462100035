activity-dependent regulation inhibitory synapse development npas4 
neuronal activity regulates development maturation excitatory inhibitory synapses mammalian brain several recent studies identified signalling networks within neurons control excitatory synapse development however less known molecular mechanisms regulate activity dependent development gaba gamma-aminobutyric acid releasing inhibitory synapses report identification transcription factor npas4 plays role development inhibitory synapses regulating expression activity dependent genes turn control number gaba releasing synapses form excitatory neurons findings demonstrate activity dependent gene program regulates inhibitory synapse development suggest new role program controlling homeostatic balance synaptic excitation inhibition
