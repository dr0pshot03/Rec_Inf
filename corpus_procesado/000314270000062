strategy modulation enzymes ubiquitin system
ubiquitin system regulates virtually aspects cellular function report method target myriad enzymes govern ubiquitination protein substrates used massively diverse combinatorial libraries ubiquitin variants develop inhibitors four deubiquitinases dubs analyzed dub-inhibitor complexes crystallography extended selection strategy ubiquitin conjugating e2 ubiquitin ligase e3 enzymes found ubiquitin variants can also enhance enzyme activity last showed ubiquitin variants can bind selectively ubiquitin-binding domains ubiquitin variants exhibit selective function cells thus enable orthogonal modulation specific enzymatic steps ubiquitin system
