experimental detection alpha-particles radioactive decay natural bismuth
naturally occurring isotope bismuth bi- commonly regarded heaviest stable isotope like heavy nuclei abundant nature characterized exceptionally long lifetime metastable respect alpha-decay however decay usually evades observation nuclear structure bi gives rise extremely low decay probability moreover generates low-energy alpha-particles difficult detect indeed dedicated experiments- attempting record alpha-decay bi nuclear emulsions failed however scintillating bolometers- operated temperatures mk offer improved detection efficiency sensitivity whereas broad palette targets available report successful use method unambiguous detection bi alpha-decay bismuth germanate detectors cooled mk measure energy release +/ statistical +/ systematic kev half-life +/ x yr agreement expected values
