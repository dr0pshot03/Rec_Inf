detection pristine gas two billion years big bang 
current cosmological model three lightest elements created first minutes big bang; elements produced later stars date however heavy elements observed astrophysical environments report detection two gas clouds discernible elements heavier hydrogen systems exhibit lowest heavy-element abundance early universe thus potential fuel metal-poor halo stars detection deuterium one system level predicted primordial nucleosynthesis provides direct confirmation standard cosmological model composition clouds implies transport heavy elements galaxies surroundings highly inhomogeneous
