cross-species genomics matches driver mutations cell compartments model ependymoma
understanding biology underlies histologically similar molecularly distinct subgroups cancer proven difficult defining genetic alterations often numerous cellular origins cancers remain unknown- sought decipher heterogeneity integrating matched genetic alterations candidate cells origin generate accurate disease models first identified subgroups human ependymoma form neural tumour arises throughout central nervous system cns subgroup-specific alterations included amplifications homozygous deletions genes yet implicated ependymoma select cellular compartments likely give rise subgroups ependymoma matched transcriptomes human tumours mouse neural stem cells nscs isolated different regions cns different developmental stages intact deleted ink4a/arf locus encodes cdkn2a b transcriptome human supratentorial ependymomas amplified ephb2 deleted ink4a/arf matched embryonic cerebral ink4a/arf-/- nscs notably activation ephb2 signalling nscs generated first mouse model ependymoma highly penetrant accurately models histology transcriptome one subgroup human supratentorial tumour comparative analysis matched mouse human tumours revealed selective deregulation expression copy number genes control synaptogenesis pinpointing disruption pathway critical event production ependymoma subgroup data demonstrate power cross-species genomics meticulously match subgroup-specific driver mutations cellular compartments model interrogate cancer subgroups
