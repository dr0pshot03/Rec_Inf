vitro studies suggest role c-jun n-terminal kinases jnks proatherogenic cellular processes show atherosclerosis-prone apoe-/- mice simultaneously lacking jnk2 apoe-/- jnk2-/- mice apoe-/- jnk1-/- mice developed less atherosclerosis apoe-/- mice pharmacological inhibition jnk activity efficiently reduced plaque formation macrophages lacking jnk2 displayed suppressed foam cell formation caused defective uptake degradation modified lipoproteins showed increased amounts modified lipoprotein-binding internalizing scavenger receptor sr-a whose phosphorylation markedly decreased macrophage-restricted deletion jnk2 sufficient decrease atherogenesis thus jnk2-dependent phosphorylation sr-a promotes uptake lipids macrophages thereby regulating foam cell formation critical step atherogenesis
