kinematic evidence old stellar halo large magellanic cloud
oldest metal-poor milky way stars form kinematically hot halo motivates two major formation scenarios galaxy: extended hierarchical accretion rapid collapse rr lyrae stars excellent tracers old metal-poor populations measured kinematics rr lyrae stars inner regions nearby large magellanic cloud lmc galaxy velocity dispersion equals +/ kilometers per second indicates kinematically hot metal-poor old halo also exists lmc result suggests galaxy smaller late-type galaxies lmc similar early formation histories
