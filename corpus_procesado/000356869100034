overcoming kerr-induced capacity limit optical fiber transmission
nonlinear optical response silica imposes fundamental limit information transfer capacity optical fibers communication beyond limit requires higher signal power suppression nonlinear distortions prevent irreversible information loss nonlinear interaction silica deterministic phenomenon can principle completely reversed however attempts remove effects nonlinear propagation led modest improvements precise physical mechanism preventing nonlinear cancellation remains unknown demonstrate optical carrier stability plays critical role canceling kerr-induced distortions nonlinear wave interaction silica can substantially reverted optical carriers possess sufficient degree mutual coherence measurements indicate fiber information capacity can notably increased previous estimates
