leptin regulation bone resorption sympathetic nervous system cart
bone remodelling mechanism vertebrates regulate bone mass comprises two phases namely resorption osteoclasts formation osteoblasts osteoblasts multifunctional cells also controlling osteoclast differentiation sympathetic signalling via beta adrenergic receptors adrb2 present osteoblasts controls bone formation downstream leptin show analysing adrb2-deficient mice sympathetic nervous system favours bone resorption increasing expression osteoblast progenitor cells osteoclast differentiation factor rankl sympathetic function requires phosphorylation protein kinase atf4 cell-specific creb-related transcription factor essential osteoblast differentiation function bone resorption increase gonadectomized adrb2-deficient mice highlights biological importance regulation also contrasts sharply increase bone resorption characterizing another hypogonadic mouse low sympathetic tone ob/ob mouse discrepancy explained part fact cart cocaine amphetamine regulated transcript neuropeptide whose expression controlled leptin nearly abolished ob/ob mice inhibits bone resorption modulating rankl expression study establishes leptin-regulated neural pathways control aspects bone remodelling demonstrates integrity sympathetic signalling necessary increase bone resorption caused gonadal failure
