bragg glass phase vortex lattice type ii superconductor
although crystals usually quite stable sensitive disordered environment: even infinitesimal amount impurities can lead destruction crystalline order resulting state matter long-standing puzzle recently believed amorphous state crystal break crystallites different theory predicts existence novel phase matter: so-called bragg glass glass yet nearly ordered perfect crystal lattice vortices contain magnetic flux type ii superconductors provide good system investigate ideas show neutron-diffraction data vortex lattice provides unambiguous evidence weak power-law decay crystalline order characteristic bragg glass theory also predicts accurately electrical transport properties superconductors naturally explains observed phase transitions- dramatic jumps critical current associated melting bragg glass moreover model explains experiments diverse x-ray scattering disordered liquid crystals conductivity electronic crystals
