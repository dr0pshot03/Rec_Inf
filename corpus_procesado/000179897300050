direct detection variable tropospheric clouds near titans south pole
atmospheric conditions saturns largest satellite titan allow possibility possess methane condensation precipitation cycle many similarities earths hydrological cycle detailed imaging studies- titan hitherto shown direct evidence tropospheric condensation clouds although indirect spectroscopic evidence transient clouds report images spectra titan show clearly transient clouds concentrated near south pole currently near point maximum solar heating discovery clouds demonstrates existence condensation localized moist convection titans atmosphere location suggests methane cloud formation controlled seasonally small variations surface temperature clouds will move south north pole year timescale
