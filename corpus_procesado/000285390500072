fetal adult hematopoietic stem cells give rise distinct t cell lineages humans 
although mammalian immune system generally thought develop linear fashion findings avian murine species argue instead developmentally ordered appearance "layering" distinct hematopoietic stem cells hscs give rise distinct lymphocyte lineages different stages development provide evidence analogous layered immune system humans results suggest fetal adult t cells distinct populations arise different populations hscs present different stages development also provide evidence fetal t cell lineage biased toward immune tolerance observations offer mechanistic explanation tolerogenic properties developing fetus variable degrees immune responsiveness birth
