consistency satellite-derived modeled estimates direct aerosol effect
intergovernmental panel climate change fourth assessment report direct aerosol effect reported radiative forcing estimate watt per square meter w m- offsetting warming co2 almost one-third uncertainty however ranges w m- largely due differences estimates global aerosol models observation-based estimates latter tending stronger negative radiative forcing study demonstrates consistency global aerosol model adjustment observation-based method producing global annual mean radiative forcing weaker w m- best estimate w m- physical explanation earlier discrepancy relative increase anthropogenic black carbon absorbing aerosols much larger overall increase anthropogenic abundance aerosols
