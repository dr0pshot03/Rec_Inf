unexpected origin plasmaspheric hiss discrete chorus emissions
plasmaspheric hiss type electromagnetic wave found ubiquitously dense plasma region encircles earth known plasmasphere important wave known remove- high energy electrons trapped along earths magnetic field lines therefore helps reduce radiation hazards satellites humans space numerous theories explain origin hiss proposed past four decades none able account fully observed properties show different wave type called chorus previously thought unrelated hiss can propagate plasmasphere tens thousands kilometres away evolve hiss new model naturally accounts observed frequency band hiss incoherent nature day night asymmetry intensity association solar activity spatial distribution connection chorus hiss interesting chorus instrumental formation high energy electrons outside plasmasphere whereas hiss depletes electrons lower equatorial altitudes
