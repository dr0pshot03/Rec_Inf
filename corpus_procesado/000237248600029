shugoshin collaborates protein phosphatase 2a protect cohesin 
sister chromatid cohesion mediated complex called cohesin crucial-particularly centromeres-for proper chromosome segregation mitosis meiosis animal mitotic cells phosphorylation cohesin promotes dissociation chromosomes centromeric cohesin protected shugoshin kinetochores properly captured spindle microtubules however mechanism shugoshin-dependent protection cohesin unknown find specific subtype serine/threonine protein phosphatase 2a pp2a associating human shugoshin pp2a colocalizes shugoshin centromeres required centromeric protection purified shugoshin complex ability reverse phosphorylation cohesin vitro suggesting dephosphorylation cohesin mechanism protection centromeres meiotic shugoshin fission yeast also associates pp2a proteins collaboratively protecting rec8-containing cohesin centromeres thus revealed conserved mechanism centromeric protection eukaryotic chromosomes mitosis meiosis
