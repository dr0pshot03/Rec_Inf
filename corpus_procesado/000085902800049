harnessing power genome search new antibiotics
past years search new antibiotics largely restricted well-known compound classes active standard set drug targets although many effective compounds discovered insufficient chemical variability generated prevent serious escalation clinical resistance recent advances genomics provided opportunity expand range potential drug targets facilitated fundamental shift direct antimicrobial screening programs toward rational target-based strategies application genome-based technologies expression profiling proteomics will lead changes drug discovery paradigm combining strengths advantages screening strategies single program
