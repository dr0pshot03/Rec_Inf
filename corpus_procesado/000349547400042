functional organization excitatory synaptic strength primary visual cortex
strength synaptic connections fundamentally determines neurons influence others firing excitatory connection amplitudes pairs cortical neurons vary two orders magnitude comprising strong connections among many weaker ones- although highly skewed distribution connection strengths observed diverse cortical areas- functional significance remains unknown: clear connection strength relates neuronal response properties strong weak inputs contribute information processing local microcircuits reveal strength connections layer / l2/ pyramidal neurons mouse primary visual cortex v1 obeys simple rule-the strong connections occur neurons correlated responses weak connections link neurons uncorrelated responses moreover show strong reciprocal connections occur cells similar spatial receptive field structure although weak connections far outnumber strong connections neuron receives majority local excitation small number strong inputs provided neurons similar responses visual features dominating recurrent excitation infrequent yet powerful inputs disproportionately contribute feature preference selectivity therefore results show apparently complex organization excitatory connection strength reflects similarity neuronal responses suggest rare strong connections mediate stimulus-specific response amplification cortical microcircuits
