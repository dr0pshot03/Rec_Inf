genetic incompatibility drives sex allocation maternal investment polymorphic finch 
genetic compatibility may drive individual mate choice decisions predictable fitness effects associated breeding incompatible partners gouldian finches erythrura gouldiae females paired genetically incompatible males alternative color morphs overproduce sons presumably reduce investment inviable daughters also observed reduced overall investment clutch size egg size care offspring resulting incompatible matings within-female experimental pairings demonstrate female birds ability adaptively adjust sex eggs allocate resources basis partner quality female gouldian finches thus make cumulative strategic allocation decisions minimize costs poor-quality pairings faced genetically incompatible partner
