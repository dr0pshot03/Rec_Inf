accurate whole human genome sequencing using reversible terminator chemistry
dna sequence information underpins genetic research enabling discoveries important biological medical benefit sequencing projects traditionally used long base pair reads existence reference sequences human many genomes makes possible develop new fast approaches re sequencing whereby shorter reads compared reference identify intraspecies genetic variation report approach generates several billion bases accurate nucleotide sequence per experiment low cost single molecules dna attached flat surface amplified situ used templates synthetic sequencing fluorescent reversible terminator deoxyribonucleotides images surface analysed generate high quality sequence demonstrate application approach human genome sequencing flow sorted x chromosomes scale approach determine genome sequence male yoruba ibadan nigeria build accurate consensus sequence average depth paired base reads characterize four million single nucleotide polymorphisms four hundred thousand structural variants many previously unknown approach effective accurate rapid economical whole genome re sequencing many biomedical applications
