discovery basaltic asteroid outer main belt
visible near-infrared spectroscopic observations asteroid magnya indicate it:has basaltic surface magnya astronomical units au sun known dynamical link family nearby large asteroid asteroid vesta au known large basaltic asteroid show region belt around magnya densely filled mean-motion resonances generating slow orbital diffusion processes providing potential mechanism removing basaltic fragments may created same:parent body magnya magnya may represent rare surviving fragment larger differentiated planetesimal disrupted long ago
