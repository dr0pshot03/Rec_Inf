ultrathin invisibility skin cloak visible light 
metamaterial-based optical cloaks thus far used volumetric distribution material properties gradually bend light thereby obscure cloaked region hence bulky hard scale critically typical carpet cloaks introduce unnecessary phase shifts reflected light making cloaks detectable demonstrate experimentally ultrathin invisibility skin cloak wrapped object skin cloak conceals three-dimensional arbitrarily shaped object complete restoration phase reflected light -nanometer wavelength skin cloak comprises metasurface distributed phase shifts rerouting light rendering object invisible contrast bulky cloaks volumetric index variation device nanometer one-ninth wavelength thick potentially scalable hiding macroscopic objects
