evidence evolution bdelloid rotifers without sexual reproduction genetic exchange 
class bdelloidea phylum rotifera largest metazoan taxon males hermaphrodites meiosis unknown conducted molecular genetic test: indication bdelloid rotifers may evolved without sexual reproduction genetic exchange test based expectation millions years without processes genomes will longer contain pairs closely similar haplotypes instead will contain highly divergent descendants formerly allelic nucleotide sequences find genomes individual bdelloid rotifers representing four different species appear lack pairs closely similar sequences contain representatives two ancient lineages began diverge bdelloid radiation many millions years ago sexual reproduction genetic exchange may ceased
