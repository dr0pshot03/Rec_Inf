controlled multiple quantum coherences nuclear spins nanometre-scale device
analytical technique nuclear magnetic resonance nmr1 based coherent quantum mechanical superposition nuclear spin states recently nmr received considerable renewed interest context quantum computation information processing- require controlled coherent qubit operations however standard nmr suitable implementation realistic scalable devices require all-electrical control means detect microscopic quantities coherent nuclear spins present self-contained nmr semiconductor device can control nuclear spins nanometre-scale region approach enables direct detection otherwise invisible multiple quantum coherences levels separated one quantum spin angular momentum microscopic high sensitivity nmr technique especially suitable probing materials whose nuclei contain multiple spin levels may form basis versatile multiple qubit device
