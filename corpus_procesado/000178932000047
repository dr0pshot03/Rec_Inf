known since cd8 t lymphocytes certain hiv- infected individuals immunologically stable secrete soluble factor termed caf suppresses hiv replication however identity caf remained elusive despite extensive search means protein-chip technology identified cluster proteins secreted cd8 t cells long-term nonprogressors hiv infection stimulated proteins identified alpha-defensin basis specific antibody recognition amino acid sequencing caf activity eliminated neutralized antibody specific human alpha-defensins synthetic purified preparations alpha-defensins also inhibited replication hiv isolates vitro taken together results indicate alpha-defensin collectively account much anti hiv activity caf attributable beta-chemokines
