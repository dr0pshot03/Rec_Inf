dendritic organization sensory input cortical neurons vivo
sensory cortex regions neurons tuned specific stimulus features example visual cortex many neurons fire predominantly response moving objects preferred orientation however characteristics synaptic input cortical neurons receive generate output firing pattern remain unclear report novel approach visualization functional mapping sensory inputs dendrites cortical neurons vivo combining high-speed two-photon imaging electrophysiological recordings identify local subthreshold calcium signals correspond orientation-specific synaptic inputs find even inputs share orientation preference widely distributed throughout dendritic tree time inputs different orientation preference interspersed adjacent dendritic segments tuned distinct orientations thus orientation-tuned neurons can compute characteristic firing pattern integrating spatially distributed synaptic inputs coding multiple stimulus orientations
