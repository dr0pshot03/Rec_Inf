direct visuomotor transformations reaching 
posterior parietal cortex ppc thought function sensorimotor transformations underlie visually guided reaching damage ppc can result difficulty reaching visual targets absence specific visual motor deficits function supported findings ppc neurons monkeys modulated direction hand movement well visual eye position limb position signals- ppc transform visual target locations retinal coordinates hand-centred coordinates combining sensory signals serial manner yield body-centred representation target location- subtracting body-centred location hand report dorsal area ppc remembered target locations coded respect eye hand suggests ppc transforms target locations directly two reference frames data obtained adjacent parietal reach region prr indicate transformation may achieved vectorially subtracting hand location target location locations represented eye-centred coordinates
