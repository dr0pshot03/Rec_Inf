drought sensitivity shapes species distribution patterns tropical forests
although patterns tree species distributions along environmental gradients amply documented tropical forests- mechanisms causing patterns seldom known efforts evaluate proposed mechanisms hampered lack comparative data species reactions relevant axes environmental variation show differential drought sensitivity shapes plant distributions tropical forests regional local scales analyses based experimental field assessments drought sensitivity species trees shrubs local regional distributions within network inventory sites spanning rainfall gradient across isthmus panama results suggest niche differentiation respect soil water availability direct determinant local regional-scale distributions tropical trees changes soil moisture availability caused global climate change forest fragmentation therefore likely alter tropical species distributions community composition diversity
