cells logic mammalian sour taste detection 
mammals taste many compounds yet use sensory palette consisting five basic taste modalities: sweet bitter sour salty umami taste monosodium glutamate although repertoire may seem modest provides animals critical information nature quality food sour taste detection functions important sensory input warn ingestion acidic example spoiled unripe food sources- used combination bioinformatics genetic functional studies identify pkd2l1 polycystic-kidney-disease-like ion channel candidate mammalian sour taste sensor tongue pkd2l1 expressed subset taste receptor cells distinct responsible sweet bitter umami taste examine role pkd2l1-expressing taste cells vivo engineered mice targeted genetic ablations selected populations taste receptor cells animals lacking pkd2l1-expressing cells completely devoid taste responses sour stimuli notably responses tastants remained unaffected proving segregation taste qualities even extends ionic stimuli results now establish independent cellular substrates four five basic taste modalities support comprehensive labelled-line mode taste coding periphery- notably pkd2l1 also expressed specific neurons surrounding central canal spinal cord demonstrate pkd2l1-expressing neurons send projections central canal selectively trigger action potentials response decreases extracellular ph propose cells correspond long-sought components cerebrospinal fluid chemosensory system taken together results suggest common basis acid sensing disparate physiological settings
