xist lncrna exploits three-dimensional genome architecture spread across x chromosome
many large noncoding rnas lncrnas regulate chromatin mechanisms localize genomic targets remain unexplored investigated localization mechanisms xist lncrna x-chromosome inactivation xci paradigm lncrna-mediated chromatin regulation maintenance xci xist binds broadly across x chromosome initiation xci xist initially transfers distal regions across x chromosome defined specific sequences instead xist identifies regions exploiting three-dimensional conformation x chromosome xist requires silencing domain spread across actively transcribed regions thereby access entire chromosome findings suggest model xist coats x chromosome searching three dimensions modifying chromosome structure spreading newly accessible locations
