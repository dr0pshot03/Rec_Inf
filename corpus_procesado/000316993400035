sirt6 regulates tnf-alpha secretion hydrolysis long-chain fatty acyl lysine
sir2 family enzymes sirtuins known nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide nad-dependent deacetylases implicated regulation transcription genome stability metabolism lifespan however four seven mammalian sirtuins weak deacetylase activity vitro show human sirt6 efficiently removes long-chain fatty acyl groups myristoyl lysine residues crystal structure sirt6 reveals large hydrophobic pocket can accommodate long-chain fatty acyl groups demonstrate sirt6 promotes secretion tumour necrosis factor-alpha tnf-alpha removing fatty acyl modification k19 k20 tnf-alpha protein lysine fatty acylation known occur mammalian cells function regulatory mechanisms modification unknown data indicate protein lysine fatty acylation novel mechanism regulates protein secretion discovery sirt6 enzyme controls protein lysine fatty acylation provides new opportunities investigate physiological function protein post-translational modification little studied now
