hf-nd isotope evidence transient dynamic regime early terrestrial mantle 
modern basalts seemingly lost memory primitive earths mantle except ambiguous isotopic signal observed rare gases although earth expected reached thermal steady state within several hundred million years refs accretion known initial chemical fractionations left planetary accretion perhaps stage involving magma ocean overshadowed fractionations imposed modern-style geodynamics lack samples older gyr early dynamic regime earth poorly understood compare published hf-nd isotope data supracrustals isua greenland similar data lunar rocks snc martian meteorites show gyr ago geochemical signature archaean mantle partly inherited initial differentiation earth observed features seem indicate planet time still losing substantial amount primordial heat survival remnants early layering modern deep mantle may account unexplained seismological thermal geochemical characteristics earth observed today
