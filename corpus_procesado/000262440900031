induced pluripotent stem cells spinal muscular atrophy patient
spinal muscular atrophy one common inherited forms neurological disease leading infant mortality patients selective loss lower motor neurons resulting muscle weakness paralysis often death although patient fibroblasts used extensively study spinal muscular atrophy motor neurons unique anatomy physiology may underlie vulnerability disease process report generation induced pluripotent stem cells skin fibroblast samples taken child spinal muscular atrophy cells expanded robustly culture maintained disease genotype generated motor neurons showed selective deficits compared derived childs unaffected mother first study show human induced pluripotent stem cells can used model specific pathology seen genetically inherited disease represents promising resource study disease mechanisms screen new drug compounds develop new therapies
