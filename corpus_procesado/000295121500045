disentangling drivers beta diversity along latitudinal elevational gradients 
understanding spatial variation biodiversity along environmental gradients central theme ecology differences species compositional turnover among sites beta diversity occurring along gradients often used infer variation processes structuring communities show sampling alone predicts changes beta diversity caused simply changes sizes species pools example forest inventories sampled along latitudinal elevational gradients show well-documented pattern beta diversity higher tropics low elevations however correcting variation pooled species richness gamma diversity differences beta diversity disappear therefore need invoke differences mechanisms community assembly temperate versus tropical systems explain global-scale patterns beta diversity
