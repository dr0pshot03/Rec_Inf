molecular cellular approaches memory allocation neural circuits 
although memory allocation subject active research computer science little known brain allocates information within neural circuits extensive literature specific types memory engage different parts brain neurons regions process store information recently however mechanisms determine specific cells synapses within neural circuit neighbors recruited learning received little attention recent findings suggest memory allocation random rather specific mechanisms regulate information stored within neural circuit new methods allow tagging imaging activation inactivation neurons behaving animals promise revolutionize studies brain circuits including memory allocation results studies likely considerable impact computer science well understanding memory disorders
