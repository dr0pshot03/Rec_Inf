observation spin coulomb drag two-dimensional electron gas 
electron propagating solid carries spin angular momentum addition mass charge late considerable interest developing electronic devices based transport spin offer potential advantages dissipation size speed charge-based devices1 however advantages bring additional complexity electron carries single fixed value -e charge electrical current carried gas electrons simply proportional total momentum fundamental consequence charge current affected interactions conserve total momentum notably collisions among electrons themselves2 contrast electrons spin along given spatial direction can take two values +/-h bar / conventionally arrow arrow spin current momentum need proportional although transport spin polarization protected momentum conservation widely assumed like charge current spin current unaffected electron electron e e interactions demonstrate experimentally assumption invalid also broad range temperature electron density flow spin polarization two-dimensional gas electrons controlled rate e e collisions
