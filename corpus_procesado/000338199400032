attenuated sensing shh ptch1 underlies evolution bovine limbs 
large spectrum limb morphologies reflects wide evolutionary diversification basic pentadactyl pattern tetrapods even-toed ungulates artiodactyls including cattle limbs adapted running consequence progressive reduction distal skeleton symmetrical elongated middle digits hoofed phalanges analyse bovine embryos establish polarized gene expression progressively lost limb development comparison mouse notably transcriptional upregulation ptch1 gene encodes sonic hedgehog shh receptor disrupted specifically bovine limb bud mesenchyme due evolutionary alteration ptch1 cis-regulatory module longer responds graded shh signalling bovine handplate development study provides molecular explanation loss digit asymmetry bovine limb buds suggests modifications affecting ptch1 cis-regulatory landscape contributed evolutionary diversification artiodactyl limbs
