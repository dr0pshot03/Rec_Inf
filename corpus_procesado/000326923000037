changes cytoplasmic volume sufficient drive spindle scaling 
mitotic spindle must function cell types vary greatly size dimensions scale rapid reductive cell divisions accompany early stages development mechanism responsible scaling unclear uncoupling cell size developmental cellular context proven experimentally challenging combined microfluidic technology xenopus egg extracts characterize spindle assembly within discrete geometrically defined volumes cytoplasm reductions cytoplasmic volume rather developmental cues changes cell shape sufficient recapitulate spindle scaling observed xenopus embryos thus mechanisms extrinsic spindle specifically limiting pool cytoplasmic components play major role determining spindle size
