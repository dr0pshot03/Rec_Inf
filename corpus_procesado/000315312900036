behavioural genetic analyses nasonia shed light evolution sex pheromones 
sex pheromones play pivotal role communication many sexually reproducing organisms1 accordingly speciation often accompanied pheromone diversification enabling proper mate finding recognition2 current theory implies chemical signals stabilizing selection receivers thereby maintain integrity signals3 tremendous diversity sex pheromones seen today evolved poorly understood45 unravel genetics newly evolved pheromone phenotype wasps present results behavioural experiments indicating evolution new pheromone component occurred established sender-receiver system show male nasonia vitripennis evolved additional pheromone compound differing stereochemistry pre-existing one comparative behavioural studies show conspecific females responded neutrally new pheromone phenotype evolved genetic mapping gene knockdown show cluster three closely linked genes accounts ability produce new pheromone phenotype data suggest new pheromone compounds can persist senders population without selected receiver without receiver pre-existing preference new pheromone phenotype initially remaining unperceived results thus contribute valuable new insights evolutionary mechanisms underlying diversification sex pheromones: furthermore indicate genetic basis new pheromone compounds can simple allowing persist long enough population receivers evolve chemosensory adaptations exploitation
