single-electron delocalization hybrid vertical-lateral double quantum dots 
used hybrid vertical-lateral double-dot device consisting laterally coupled vertical quantum dots measure interdot tunnel coupling using nonlinear transport measurements coulomb diamonds showed inherent asymmetry capacitances component dots influences diamond slopes thereby allowing determination dot electron passed used technique prepare delocalized one-electron state heitler-london hl two-electron state showed interdot tunnel coupling determines whether hl ground state tunable implies device may useful implementing two-electron spin entanglement
