air-snow interactions atmospheric chemistry
presence snow greatly perturbs composition near-surface polar air higher concentrations hydroxyl radicals oh observed result greater oxidative capacity lower atmosphere emissions nitrogen oxides nitrous acid light aldehydes acetone molecular halogens also detected photolysis nitrate ions contained snow appears play important role creating perturbations oh formed snowpack can oxidize organic matter halide ions snow producing carbonyl compounds halogens released atmosphere incorporated snow crystals reactions modify composition snow interstitial air overlying atmosphere reconstructing composition past atmospheres ice-core analyses may therefore require complex corrections modeling reactive species
