natural selection shapes genome-wide patterns copy-number polymorphism drosophila melanogaster 
role natural selection plays governing locations early evolution copy number mutations remains largely unexplored used high density full genome tiling arrays create fine scale genomic map copy number polymorphisms cnps drosophila melanogaster inferred total independent cnps % overlap genes include cnps likely positive selection notably high frequency duplications encompassing toxin response genes locations frequencies cnps strongly shaped purifying selection deletions stronger purifying selection duplications among duplications overlapping exons introns well falling x chromosome seem subject stronger purifying selection
