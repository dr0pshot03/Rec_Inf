evolution diversity subduction zones controlled slab width 
subducting slabs provide main driving force plate motion flow earths mantle- geodynamic seismic geochemical studies offer insight slab dynamics subduction-induced flow- previous geodynamic studies treat subduction zones either infinite trench-parallel extent two-dimensional finite width fixed space subduction zones associated slabs however limited lateral extent - km three-dimensional geometry evolves time show slab width controls two first-order features plate tectonics curvature subduction zones tendency retreat backwards time using three-dimensional numerical simulations free subduction show trench migration rate inversely related slab width depends proximity lateral slab edge results consistent retreat velocities observed globally maximum velocities cm yr- observed close slab edges < km whereas far edges > km retreat velocities always slow < cm yr- models narrow slabs < km retreat fast develop curved geometry concave towards mantle wedge side models slabs intermediate width similar - km sublinear retreat slowly models wide slabs > km nearly stationary centre develop convex geometry whereas trench retreat increases towards concave-shaped edges additionally identify periods myr slow trench advance centre wide slabs wide-slab behaviour may explain mountain building central andes consequence tectonic setting far slab edges
