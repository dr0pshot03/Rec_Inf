temporal fragmentation speciation bacteria 
bacterial recombination involves occasional transfer small dna fragments strains different sets niche-specific genes may maintained populations freely recombine loci therefore genetic isolation may established different times different chromosomal regions speciation recombination niche-specific genes curtailed test model separated sequence divergence rate time components revealing different regions escherichia coli salmonella enterica chromosomes diverged similar million-year period genetic isolation first occurred regions carrying species-specific genes indicating physiological distinctiveness nascent escherichia salmonella lineages maintained tens millions years complete genetic isolation chromosomes
