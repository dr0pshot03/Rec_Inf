parent-offspring conflict coadaptation 
evolution family life traditionally studied parallel behavioral ecologists quantitative geneticists former focus parent-offspring conflict whether parents offspring control provisioning whereas latter concentrate coadaptation parental supply offspring demand show prenatal effects offspring begging can link two different approaches using theoretical experimental analyses show offspring control provisioning prenatal effects primarily serve parents interests: selection parents drives coadaptation parent offspring traits contrast parents control provisioning prenatal effects primarily serve offsprings interests: selection offspring drives coadaptation parent offspring traits parent-offspring conflict may thus responsible selective forces generate parent-offspring coadaptation
