divergent sexual selection enhances reproductive isolation sticklebacks
sexual selection may facilitate speciation can cause rapid evolutionary diversification male mating signals female preferences divergence traits can contribute reproductive isolation- sensory drive hypothesis predicts three mechanisms underlie divergence sexually selected traits: habitat-specific transmission male signals- adaptation female perceptual sensitivity local ecological conditions matching male signals female perceptual sensitivity test mechanisms threespine sticklebacks gasterosteus spp live different light environments show female perceptual sensitivity red light varies extent redshift light environment contributes divergent preferences male nuptial colour varies environment tuned female perceptual sensitivity extent divergence among populations male signal colour female preference red correlated extent reproductive isolation recently diverged species results demonstrate divergent sexual selection generated sensory drive contributes speciation
