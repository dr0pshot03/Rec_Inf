recyclable strong thermosets organogels via paraformaldehyde condensation diamines
nitrogen-based thermoset polymers many industrial applications example composites difficult recycle rework report simple one-pot low-temperature polycondensation paraformaldehyde -oxydianiline oda forms hemiaminal dynamic covalent networks hdcns can cyclize high temperatures producing polyhexahydrotriazines phts materials strong thermosetting polymers phts exhibited high youngs moduli similar gigapascals gigapascals reinforced surface-treated carbon nanotubes excellent solvent resistance resistance environmental stress cracking however hdcns phts digested low ph < recover bisaniline monomers simply using different diamine monomers hdcn pht-forming reactions afford extremely versatile materials platforms example polyethylene glycol peg diamine monomers used form hdcns elastic organogels formed exhibited self-healing properties
