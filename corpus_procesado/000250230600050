interferon modulation cellular micrornas antiviral mechanism 
rna interference non-coding micrornas mirnas represents vital component innate antiviral immune response plants invertebrate animals however role cellular mirnas defence viral infection mammalian organisms thus far remained elusive show interferon beta ifn beta rapidly modulates expression numerous cellular mirnas eight ifn beta-induced mirnas sequence-predicted targets within hepatitis c virus hcv genomic rna introduction synthetic mirna-mimics corresponding ifn beta-induced mirnas reproduces antiviral effects ifn beta hcv replication infection whereas neutralization antiviral mirnas anti-mirnas reduces antiviral effects ifn beta hcv addition demonstrate ifn beta treatment leads significant reduction expression liver-specific mir- mirna previously shown essential hcv replication therefore findings strongly support notion mammalian organisms interferon system use cellular mirnas combat viral infections
