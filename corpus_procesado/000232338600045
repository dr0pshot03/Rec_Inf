trophic cascades across ecosystems 
predation can intense creating strong direct indirect effects throughout food webs1- addition ecologists increasingly recognize fluxes organisms across ecosystem boundaries can major consequences community dynamics56 species complex life histories often shift habitats life cycles7 provide potent conduits coupling ecosystems56 thus local interactions affect predator abundance one ecosystem example larval habitat may reverberating effects another example adult habitat show fish indirectly facilitate terrestrial plant reproduction cascading trophic interactions across ecosystem boundaries fish reduce larval dragonfly abundances ponds leading fewer adult dragonflies nearby adult dragonflies consume insect pollinators alter foraging behaviour result plants near ponds fish receive pollinator visits less pollen limited plants near fish-free ponds results confirm strong species interactions can reverberate across ecosystems emphasize importance landscape-level processes driving local species interactions
