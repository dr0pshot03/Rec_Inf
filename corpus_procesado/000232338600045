trophic cascades across ecosystems
predation can intense creating strong direct indirect effects throughout food webs- addition ecologists increasingly recognize fluxes organisms across ecosystem boundaries can major consequences community dynamics species complex life histories often shift habitats life cycles provide potent conduits coupling ecosystems thus local interactions affect predator abundance one ecosystem example larval habitat may reverberating effects another example adult habitat show fish indirectly facilitate terrestrial plant reproduction cascading trophic interactions across ecosystem boundaries fish reduce larval dragonfly abundances ponds leading fewer adult dragonflies nearby adult dragonflies consume insect pollinators alter foraging behaviour result plants near ponds fish receive pollinator visits less pollen limited plants near fish-free ponds results confirm strong species interactions can reverberate across ecosystems emphasize importance landscape-level processes driving local species interactions
