patterns mechanisms early pliocene warmth 
five four million years ago early pliocene epoch earth warm temperate climate gradual cooling followed led establishment modern temperature patterns possibly response decrease atmospheric co2 concentration order parts per million towards preindustrial values synthesize available geochemical proxy records sea surface temperature show compared today early pliocene climate substantially lower meridional zonal temperature gradients similar maximum ocean temperatures using earth system model show none mechanisms currently proposed explain pliocene warmth can simultaneously reproduce three crucial features suggest combination several dynamical feedbacks underestimated models present related ocean mixing cloud albedo may responsible climate conditions
