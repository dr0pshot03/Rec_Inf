multiple reference genomes transcriptomes arabidopsis thaliana
genetic differences arabidopsis thaliana accessions underlie plants extensive phenotypic variation now interpreted largely context annotated reference accession col- report sequencing assembly annotation genomes natural thaliana accessions transcriptomes assessed basis reference annotation one-third protein-coding genes predicted disrupted least one accession however re-annotation genome revealed alternative gene models often restore coding potential gene expression seedlings differed nearly half expressed genes frequently associated cis variants within kilobases intron retention alternative splicing events sequence expression variation pronounced genes respond biotic environment data promote evolutionary functional studies thaliana especially magic genetic reference population descended accessions
