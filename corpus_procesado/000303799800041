de novo mutations revealed whole-exome sequencing strongly associated autism 
multiple studies confirmed contribution rare de novo copy number variations risk autism spectrum disorders1- whereas de novo single nucleotide variants identified affected individuals4 contribution risk yet clarified specifically frequency distribution mutations well characterized matched unaffected controls data vital interpretation de novo coding mutations observed probands show using whole-exome sequencing individuals including phenotypically discordant sibling pairs highly disruptive nonsense splice-site de novo mutations brain-expressed genes associated autism spectrum disorders carry large effects basis mutation rates unaffected individuals demonstrate multiple independent de novo single nucleotide variants gene among unrelated probands reliably identifies risk alleles providing clear path forward gene discovery among total identified de novo coding mutations single instance probands none siblings two independent nonsense variants disrupt gene scn2a sodium channel voltage-gated type ii alpha subunit result highly unlikely chance
