retinal waves coordinate patterned activity throughout developing visual system 
morphological functional development vertebrate nervous system initially governed genetic factors subsequently refined neuronal activity however fundamental features nervous system emerge sensory experience possible thus activity-dependent development occurring onset experience must driven spontaneous activity origin nature activity vivo remains largely untested use optical methods show live neonatal mice waves spontaneous retinal activity present propagate throughout entire visual system eye opening patterned activity encompassed visual field relied cholinergic neurotransmission preferentially initiated binocular retina exhibited spatiotemporal correlations two hemispheres retinal waves primary source activity midbrain primary visual cortex modulated ongoing activity secondary visual areas thus spontaneous retinal activity transmitted entire visual system carries patterned information capable guiding activity-dependent development complex intra-and inter-hemispheric circuits onset vision
