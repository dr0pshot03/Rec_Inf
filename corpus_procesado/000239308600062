mc1r germline variants confer risk braf-mutant melanoma 
germline variants mc1r gene encoding melanocortin receptor sun exposure increase risk melanoma caucasians majority melanomas occur skin little evidence chronic sun-induced damage non-csd melanoma mutations braf oncogene whereas melanomas skin marked csd csd melanoma mutations less frequent two independent caucasian populations show mc1r variants strongly associated braf mutations non-csd melanomas tumor subtype risk melanoma associated mc1r due increase risk developing melanomas braf mutations
