major role planktonic phosphate reduction marine phosphorus redox cycle 
phosphorus + oxidation state ie phosphate abundant form phosphorus global ocean enigmatic pool dissolved phosphonate molecules phosphorus + oxidation state also ubiquitous; however cycling phosphorus oxidation states remained poorly constrained using simple incubation chromatography approaches measured rate chemical reduction phosphate piii compounds western tropical north atlantic ocean colonial nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria surface waters played critical role phosphate reduction classes plankton including potentially deep-water archaea also involved data consistent marine geochemical evidence microbial genomic information together suggest existence vast oceanic phosphorus redox cycle
