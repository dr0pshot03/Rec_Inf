glutamate-receptor-interacting protein grip1 directly steers kinesin dendrites
cells molecular motors operate polarized sorting molecules although steering mechanisms motors remain elusive neurons kinesin motor conducts vesicular transport transport synaptic vesicle components axons neurotransmitter receptors dendrites indicating vesicles may drive motor direction correct show ampa alpha-amino--hydroxy- methylisoxazole--propionate receptor subunit-glur2-interacting protein grip1-can directly interact steer kinesin heavy chains dendrites motor ampa receptors expected complex functional gene targeting dominant negative experiments heavy chains mouse kinesin showed abnormal localization grip1 moreover expression kinesin-binding domain grip1 resulted accumulation endogenous kinesin predominantly somatodendritic area pattern different generated overexpression kinesin-binding scaffold protein jsap1 jnk/sapk-associated protein- also known mapk8ip3 occurred predominantly somatoaxon area results indicate directly binding proteins can determine traffic direction motor protein
