perceiving visual expansion without optic flow
observer moves forward environment image retina expands rate expansion conveys information observers speed time collision- psychophysical- physiological studies provided abundant evidence expansionary motions processed specialized mechanisms mammalian visual systems commonly assumed rate expansion estimated divergence optic-flow field two-dimensional field local translational velocities- rate might also estimated changes size scale image features determine whether human vision uses scale-change information synthesized stochastic texture stimuli scale image elements increases gradually time optic-flow pattern random show using stimuli observers can estimate expansion rates scale-change information alone pure scale changes can produce motion after-effects two findings suggest visual system contains mechanisms explicitly sensitive changes scale
