effect p53 status tumor response antiangiogenic therapy 
p53 tumor suppressor gene inactivated majority human cancers tumor cells deficient p53 display diminished rate apoptosis hypoxic conditions circumstance might reduce reliance vascular supply hence responsiveness antiangiogenic therapy report mice bearing tumors derived p53-/- hct116 human colorectal cancer cells less responsive antiangiogenic combination therapy mice bearing isogenic p53+/+ tumors thus although antiangiogenic therapy targets genetically stable endothelial cells tumor vasculature genetic alterations decrease vascular dependence tumor cells can influence therapeutic response tumors therapy
