explosive percolation random networks 
networks formation connections governed random process often undergo percolation transition wherein around critical point addition small number connections causes sizable fraction network suddenly become linked together typically transitions continuous percentage network linked together tends zero right transition point whether percolation transitions discontinuous open question show incorporating limited amount choice classic erdos-renyi network formation model causes percolation transition become discontinuous
