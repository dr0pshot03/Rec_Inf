enhancing depression mechanisms midbrain dopamine neurons achieves homeostatic resilience 
typical therapies try reverse pathogenic mechanisms describe treatment effects achieved enhancing depression-causing mechanisms ventral tegmental area vta dopamine da neurons social defeat stress model depression depressed susceptible mice display hyperactivity vta da neurons caused up-regulated hyperpolarization-activated current i-h mice resilient social defeat stress however exhibit stable normal firing neurons unexpectedly resilient mice even larger ih observed parallel increased potassium k+ channel currents experimentally enhancing ih optogenetically increasing hyperactivity vta da neurons susceptible mice completely reversed depression-related behaviors antidepressant effect achieved resilience-like projection-specific homeostatic plasticity results indicate potential therapeutic path promoting natural resilience depression treatment
