grain size-sensitive creep ice ii
rheological experiments fine-grained water ice ii low strain rates reveal creep mechanism dominates conditions low stress using cryogenic scanning electron microscopy observed change stress exponent correlates strongly decrease grain size micrometers grain size-sensitive creep ice ii demonstrated plausibly dominates plastic strain low-stress conditions interior medium large-sized icy moons outer solar system
