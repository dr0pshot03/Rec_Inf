chirality planar cell shape contributes left-right asymmetric epithelial morphogenesis
organs animals display left-right lr asymmetry better understand lr asymmetric morphogenesis drosophila studied lr directional rotation hindgut epithelial tube hindgut epithelial cells adopt lr asymmetric chiral cell shape within plane refer cell behavior planar cell-shape chirality pcc drosophila e-cadherin de-cad distributed cell boundaries lr asymmetry responsible pcc formation myosin id switches lr polarity found pcc de-cad distribution coincides direction rotation silico simulation showed pcc sufficient induce directional rotation tissue thus intrinsic chirality epithelial cells vivo underlying mechanism lr asymmetric tissue morphogenesis
