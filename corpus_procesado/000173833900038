crossover classical quantum shot noise chaotic cavities
discreteness charge units e led schottky predict electrical current vacuum tube fluctuates even spurious noise sources eliminated carefully phenomenon now widely known shot noise recent years shot noise mesoscopic conductors charge motion quantum-coherent distances comparable system size studied extensively- experiments charge propagate isolated entity free space vacuum tubes part degenerate quantum-coherent fermi sea charges predicted shot noise mesoscopic conductors can disappear altogether system tuned regime electron motion becomes classically chaotic experimentally verify prediction using chaotic cavities time electrons dwell inside can tuned shot noise present large dwell times electron motion cavity smeared quantum scattering disappears short dwell times motion becomes classically deterministic
