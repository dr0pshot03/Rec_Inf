roaming atom: straying reaction path formaldehyde decomposition
present combined experimental theoretical investigation formaldehyde h2co dissociation h co energies just threshold competing h elimination high-resolution state-resolved imaging measurements co velocity distributions reveal two dissociation pathways first proceeds well-established transition state produce rotationally excited co vibrationally cold h- second dissociation pathway yields rotationally cold co conjunction highly vibrationally excited h- quasi-classical trajectory calculations performed global potential energy surface h2co suggest second channel represents intramolecular hydrogen abstraction mechanism: one hydrogen atom explores large regions potential energy surface bonding second h atom bypassing saddle point entirely
