hexanucleotide element directs microrna nuclear import 
micrornas mirnas negatively regulate partially complementary target messenger rnas target selection animals dictated primarily sequences mirna end demonstrated despite small size specific mirnas contain additional sequence elements control posttranscriptional behavior including subcellular localization showed human mir-29b contrast studied animal mirnas predominantly localized nucleus distinctive hexanucleotide terminal motif mir-29b acts transferable nuclear localization element directs nuclear enrichment mirnas small interfering rnas attached results indicate mirnas sharing common sequences considered largely redundant might distinct functions influence cis-acting regulatory motifs
