generation pluripotent stem cells adult mouse liver stomach cells
induced pluripotent stem ips cells generated mouse human fibroblasts retroviral transduction four transcription factors however cell origins molecular mechanisms ips cell induction remain elusive report describes generation ips cells adult mouse hepatocytes gastric epithelial cells ips cell clones appear equivalent embryonic stem cells gene expression competent generate germline chimeras genetic lineage tracings show liver derived ips cells derived albumin-expressing cells common retroviral integration sites found among multiple clones data suggest ips cells generated direct reprogramming lineage committed somatic cells retroviral integration specific sites required
