universality galactic surface densities within one dark halo scale-length
recently discovered mean dark matter surface density within one dark halo scale-length radius within volume density profile dark matter remains approximately flat constant across wide range galaxies scaling relation holds galaxies spanning luminosity range magnitudes whole hubble sequence- report luminous matter surface density also constant within one scale-length dark halo means gravitational acceleration generated luminous component galaxies always radius although total luminous-to-dark matter ratio constant within one halo scale-length constant finding can interpreted close correlation enclosed surface densities luminous dark matter galaxies
