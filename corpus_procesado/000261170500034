total synthesis bryostatin using atom-economical chemoselective approaches
concepts used improve efficiency organic syntheses two especially effective: atom economy use routes atoms present reactants also end product chemoselectivity use reactions take place desired positions molecule synthesis complex natural products demanding arena explore principles bryostatin family compounds especially interesting targets combine structural complexity promising biological activity- furthermore synthetic routes bryostatins already reported- providing benchmark new syntheses can measured report concise total synthesis bryostatin parent structure almost bryostatins principle accessed application atom-economical chemoselective reactions currently development provides ready access polyhydropyran motifs molecule common structural features many natural products notable transformations two transition-metal catalysed reactions first palladium catalysed reaction two different alkynes form large ring product step converted dihydropyran c ring bryostatins second key reaction catalysed gold compound analogues bryostatin exist nature readily made following route might allow biological activity bryostatins fine tuned
