dead-box rna helicase dbp5 functions translation termination
eukaryotes termination messenger rna mrna translation mediated release factors erf1 erf3 using saccharomyces cerevisiae model organism identified member dead-box protein dbp family dead-box rna helicase mrna export factor dbp5 player translation termination dbp5 interacts genetically release factors polyadenlyate-binding protein pab1 physical interaction specifically detected erf1 moreover show helicase activity dbp5 required efficient stop-codon recognition intact dbp5 essential recruitment erf3 termination complexes therefore dbp5 controls erf3-erf1 interaction thus erf3-mediated downstream events
