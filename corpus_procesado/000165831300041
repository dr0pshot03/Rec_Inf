geomagnetic intensity variations past kyr obtained near-seafloor magnetic anomalies
knowledge past variations intensity earths magnetic field provides important constraint models geodynamo record absolute palaeointensity past kyr compiled archaeomagnetic volcanic materials relative palaeointensities past kyr obtained sedimentary sequences long-term record geomagnetic intensity also carried thermoremanence oceanic crust show near-seafloor magnetic anomalies recorded southern east pacific rise well correlated independent estimates geomagnetic intensity past kyr moreover pattern absolute palaeointensity seafloor glass samples area agrees well-documented dipole intensity pattern past kyr comparison palaeointensities derived seafloor glass samples global intensity variations thus allows us estimate ages surficial lava flows region record geomagnetic intensity preserved oceanic crust provide higher-time-resolution record crustal accretion processes mid-ocean ridges previously obtainable
