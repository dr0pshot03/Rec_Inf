resolving opal paradox southern ocean 
southern ocean high accumulation rates opal-which forms precipitation silica-bearing solutions-have found sediment spite low production rates biogenic silica carbon overlying surface waters so-called opal paradox generally attributed higher efficiency opal preservation southern ocean elsewhere report biogenic silica production rates opal rain rates water column opal sediment burial rates indian ocean sector southern ocean show assumed opal paradox result underestimated opal production rates overestimated opal accumulation rates data thus demonstrate overall preservation efficiency biogenic opal region substantially lower previously thought lies within factor two global mean comparison revised opal preservation efficiencies southern ocean existing values equatorial pacific ocean north atlantic ocean shows spatial differences preservation efficiencies primary reason differences sedimentary opal accumulation reconciliation surface production rates sedimentary accumulation rates may enable use biogenic opal reconstruction palaeo-productivity factors affect si/c ratio better understood
