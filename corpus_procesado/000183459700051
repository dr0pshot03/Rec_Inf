fusion cells flipped snares 
snare soluble n-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor hypothesis suggests pairs proteins known vesicle v- snares target membrane t- snares interact specifically control mediate intracellular membrane fusion events cells expressing interacting domains v t snares cell surface found fuse spontaneously demonstrating snares sufficient fuse biological membranes
