lophenteropneust hypothesis refuted collection photos new deep-sea hemichordates 
deep ocean home group broad-collared hemichordates so-called lophenteropneusts photographed gliding sea floor- previously collected claimed worms collar tentacles blend morphological features two main hemichordate body plans namely tentacle-less enteropneusts tentacle-bearing pterobranchs consequently lophenteropneusts invoked missing links suggest former evolved latter significant aspect lophenteropneust hypothesis prediction fundamental body plan within basal phylum deuterostomes enteropneust-like assumption ancestral state influences ideas evolution vertebrates invertebrates- report first collected specimen broad-collared deep-sea enteropneust describe new family genus species collar although disproportionately broad lacks tentacles addition find evidence tentacles available deep-sea photographs published unpublished broad-collared enteropneusts including formerly designated lophenteropneusts thus lophenteropneust hypothesis based misinterpretation deep-sea photographs low quality longer used support idea enteropneust body plan basal within phylum hemichordata
