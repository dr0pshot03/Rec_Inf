single synaptic vesicles fusing transiently successively without loss identity 
vesicle fusion recycling particularly critical ongoing neurotransmitter release- small nerve terminals brain typically contain functional vesicles however modes exocytosis endocytosis operate synapses central nervous system incompletely understood show real-time visualization single vesicle fusing small synapse central nervous system made possible highly intensified charge-coupled device imaging hippocampal synaptic terminals single vesicle labelled fluorescent membrane marker fm1 ref small number cases full loss fluorescent membrane dye elicited single action potential consistent classical complete collapse cases however action potentials triggered partial loss fluorescence suggesting vesicular retention membrane marker consistent kiss-and-run vesicle cycling- alternative hypothesis independent fusion partially stained vesicles arising endosomal splitting excluded observations size timing successive fusion events thus experimental evidence supports predominance kiss-and-run fusion events- rapid vesicular re-use
