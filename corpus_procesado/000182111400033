wnt-mediated axon guidance via drosophila derailed receptor
nervous systems bilateral symmetry many neurons project axons across midline opposite side segment drosophila embryonic nervous system axons display projection pattern choose one two distinct tracts: anterior posterior commissure commissure choice controlled derailed atypical receptor tyrosine kinase expressed axons projecting anterior commissure show derailed keeps axons posterior commissure acting receptor wnt5 member wnt family secreted signalling molecules results reveal unexpected role axon guidance wnt family member show derailed receptor essential component wnt signalling guidance events
