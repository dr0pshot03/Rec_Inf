bacterial e3 ubiquitin ligase targets host protein kinase disrupt plant immunity 
many bacterial pathogens plants animals use type iii secretion system deliver diverse virulence-associated effector proteins host cell1 mechanisms effectors act mostly unknown; however often promote disease suppressing host immunity2 one type iii effector avrptob expressed plant pathogen pseudomonas syringae pv tomato carboxy-terminal domain e3 ubiquitin ligase3 deletion domain allows amino-terminal region avrptob avrptob1- detected certain tomato varieties leading immunity-associated programmed cell death4 show host kinase fen physically interacts avrptob1- responsible activating plant immune response avrptob e3 ligase specifically ubiquitinates fen promotes degradation proteasome-dependent manner degradation leads disease susceptibility fen-expressing tomato lines various wild species tomato found exhibit immunity response avrptob1- full-length avrptob thus acquiring e3 ligase domain avrptob thwarted highly conserved host resistance mechanism
