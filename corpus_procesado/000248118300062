bacterial e3 ubiquitin ligase targets host protein kinase disrupt plant immunity 
many bacterial pathogens plants animals use type iii secretion system deliver diverse virulence-associated effector proteins host cell mechanisms effectors act mostly unknown however often promote disease suppressing host immunity one type iii effector avrptob expressed plant pathogen pseudomonas syringae pv tomato carboxy-terminal domain e3 ubiquitin ligase deletion domain allows amino-terminal region avrptob avrptob- detected certain tomato varieties leading immunity-associated programmed cell death show host kinase fen physically interacts avrptob- responsible activating plant immune response avrptob e3 ligase specifically ubiquitinates fen promotes degradation proteasome-dependent manner degradation leads disease susceptibility fen-expressing tomato lines various wild species tomato found exhibit immunity response avrptob- full-length avrptob thus acquiring e3 ligase domain avrptob thwarted highly conserved host resistance mechanism
