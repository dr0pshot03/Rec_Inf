lower predation risk migratory birds high latitudes 
quantifying costs benefits migration distance critical understanding evolution long-distance migration migratory birds life history theory predicts potential survival costs migrating longer distances balanced benefits lifetime reproductive success yet quantification reproductive benefits controlled manner along large geographical gradient challenging measured controlled effect predation risk along kilometer south-north gradient arctic found nest predation risk declined twofold along latitudinal gradient results provide evidence birds migrating farther north may acquire reproductive benefits form lower nest predation risk
