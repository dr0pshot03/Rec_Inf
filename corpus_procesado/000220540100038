intermediate-depth earthquake faulting dehydration embrittlement negative volume change
earthquakes observed occur subduction zones depths approximately km even though unassisted brittle failure inhibited depths greater km owing high pressures temperatures- thought earthquakes particularly intermediate depths km may instead triggered embrittlement accompanying dehydration hydrous minerals principally serpentine- problem failure serpentine dehydration volume change accompanying dehydration becomes negative pressures gpa km depth brittle fracture mechanics predicts instability quenched show dehydration antigorite serpentinite stress results faults delineated ultrafine-grained solid reaction products formed dehydration phenomenon observed conditions tested pressures gpa temperatures 820degreesc independent sign volume change reaction although result contradicts expectations fracture mechanics can explained separation fluid solid residue faulting hypothesis supported observations observations confirm dehydration embrittlement viable mechanism nucleating earthquakes independent depth long hydrous minerals breaking differential stress
