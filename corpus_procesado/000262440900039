experience leaves lasting structural trace cortical circuits 
sensory experiences exert powerful influence function future performance neuronal circuits mammalian neocortex- restructuring synaptic connections believed one mechanism cortical circuits store information sensory world excitatory synaptic structures dendritic spines dynamic entities- remain sensitive alteration sensory input throughout life remains unclear however whether structural changes level dendritic spines can outlast original experience thereby provide morphological basis long term information storage follow spine dynamics apical dendrites pyramidal neurons functionally defined regions adult mouse visual cortex plasticity eye specific responses induced repeated closure one eye monocular deprivation first monocular deprivation episode doubled rate spine formation thereby increasing spine density effect specific layer cells located binocular cortex neurons increase responsiveness non-deprived eye restoring binocular vision returned spine dynamics baseline levels absolute spine density remained elevated many monocular deprivation-induced spines persisted period functional recovery however spine addition increase eye closed second time absence structural plasticity stands robust changes eye specific responses occur even faster repeated deprivation thus spines added first monocular deprivation experience may provide structural basis subsequent functional shifts results provide strong link functional plasticity specific synaptic rearrangements revealing mechanism prior experiences stored cortical circuits
