general model ontogenetic growth
several equations proposed describe ontogenetic growth trajectories organisms justified primarily goodness rt rather biological mechanism- derive general quantitative model based fundamental principles- allocation metabolic energy maintenance existing tissue production new biomass thus predict parameters governing growth curves basic cellular properties derive single parameterless universal curve describes growth many diverse species model provides basis deriving allometric relationships growth rates timing life history events
