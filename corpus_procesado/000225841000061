mammalian tissue oxygen levels modulate iron-regulatory protein activities vivo
iron-regulatory proteins irps posttranscriptionally regulate expression transferrin receptor ferritin iron metabolism proteins although irps can regulate expression target genes irp2-/- mice significantly misregulate iron metabolism develop neurodegeneration whereas irp1-/- mice spared found irp2-/- cells misregulated iron metabolism cultured % oxygen comparable physiological tissue concentrations % oxygen concentration activated irp1 allowed substitute irp2 thus irp2 dominates regulation mammalian iron homeostasis alone registers iron concentrations modulates rna-binding activity physiological oxygen tensions
