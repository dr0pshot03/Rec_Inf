one-way control fwa imprinting arabidopsis endosperm dna methylation 
arabidopsis fwa gene initially identified late-flowering epigenetic mutants show ectopic fwa expression associated heritable hypomethylation repeats around transcription starting sites show wild-type fwa displays imprinted maternal origin-specific expression endosperm fwa imprint depends maintenance dna methyltransferase met1 case mammals unlike mammals however fwa imprint established allele-specific de novo methylation established maternal gametophyte-specific gene activation depends dna glycosylase gene demeter endosperm contribute next generation activated fwa gene need silenced double fertilization enables plants use one-way control imprinting dna methylation endosperm
