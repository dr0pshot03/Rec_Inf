acetylcholine contributes muscarinic receptors attentional modulation v1 
attention exerts strong influence neuronal processing cortical areas12 selectively increases firing rates2- affects tuning properties15 including changing receptive field locations sizes36 although effects well studied cellular mechanisms poorly understood study cellular mechanisms combined iontophoretic pharmacological analysis cholinergic receptors single cell recordings v1 rhesus macaque monkeys macaca mulatta performed task demanded top spatial attention attending receptive field v1 neuron study caused increase firing rates show attentional modulation enhanced low doses acetylcholine furthermore applying muscarinic antagonist scopolamine reduced attentional modulation whereas nicotinic antagonist mecamylamine systematic effect results demonstrate muscarinic cholinergic mechanisms play central part mediating effects attention v1
