allogeneic igg combined dendritic cell stimuli induce antitumour t-cell immunity 
whereas cancers grow within host tissues evade host immunity immune-editing immunosuppression1- tumours rarely transmissible individuals much like transplanted allogeneic organs allogeneic tumours reliably rejected host t cells even tumour host share major histocompatibility complex alleles potent determinants transplant rejection6- tumour-eradicating immunity initiated remains unknown although elucidating process provide basis inducing similar responses naturally arising tumours find allogeneic tumour rejection initiated mice naturally occurring tumour-binding igg antibodies enable dendritic cells dcs internalize tumour antigens subsequently activate tumour-reactive t cells exploited mechanism treat autologous autochthonous tumours successfully either systemic administration dcs loaded allogeneic-igg-coated tumour cells intratumoral injection allogeneic igg combination dc stimuli induced potent t-cell-mediated antitumour immune responses resulting tumour eradication mouse models melanoma pancreas lung breast cancer moreover strategy led eradication distant tumours metastases well injected primary tumours assess clinical relevance findings studied antibodies cells patients lung cancer t cells patients responded vigorously autologous tumour antigens culture allogeneic-igg-loaded dcs recapitulating findings mice results reveal tumour-binding allogeneic igg can induce powerful antitumour immunity can exploited cancer immunotherapy
