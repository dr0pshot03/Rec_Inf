pluripotent stem cells induced mouse somatic cells small-molecule compounds
pluripotent stem cells can induced somatic cells providing unlimited cell resource potential studying disease use regenerative medicine however genetic manipulation technically challenging strategies nuclear transfer used reprogramming limit clinical applications show pluripotent stem cells can generated mouse somatic cells frequency % using combination seven small-molecule compounds chemically induced pluripotent stem cells resemble embryonic stem cells terms gene expression profiles epigenetic status potential differentiation germline transmission using small molecules exogenous master genes dispensable cell fate reprogramming chemical reprogramming strategy potential use generating functional desirable cell types clinical applications
