overflow metabolism escherichia coli results efficient proteome allocation 
overflow metabolism refers seemingly wasteful strategy cells use fermentation instead efficient respiration generate energy despite availability oxygen known warburg effect context cancer growth phenomenon occurs ubiquitously fast-growing cells including bacteria fungi mammalian cells origin remained unclear despite decades research study metabolic overflow escherichia coli show global physiological response used cope changing proteomic demands energy biogenesis biomass synthesis different growth conditions simple model proteomic resource allocation can quantitatively account observed behaviours accurately predict responses new perturbations key hypothesis model proteome cost energy biogenesis respiration exceeds fermentation quantitatively confirmed direct measurement protein abundances via quantitative mass spectrometry
