chemical identification individual surface atoms atomic force microscopy
scanning probe microscopy versatile powerful method uses sharp tips image measure manipulate matter surfaces atomic resolution cryogenic temperatures scanning probe microscopy can even provide electron tunnelling spectra serve fingerprints vibrational properties adsorbed molecules- electronic properties magnetic impurity atoms thereby allowing chemical identification many instances particularly insulating systems determining exact chemical composition surfaces nanostructures remains considerable challenge principle dynamic force microscopy make possible overcome problem: can image insulator semiconductor metal surfaces true atomic resolution- detecting precisely measuring- short-range forces arise onset chemical bonding tip surface atoms depend sensitively chemical identity atoms involved report precise measurements short-range chemical forces show dependence force microscope tip used can overcome normalization procedure allows us use chemical force measurements basis atomic recognition even room temperature illustrate performance approach imaging surface particularly challenging alloy system successfully identifying three constituent atomic species silicon tin lead even though exhibit similar chemical properties identical surface position preferences render discrimination attempt based topographic measurements impossible
