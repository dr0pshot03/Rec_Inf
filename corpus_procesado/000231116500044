wide depth distribution seismic tremors along northern cascadia margin 
cascadia subduction zone thought capable generating major earthquakes moment magnitude large m-w interval several hundred years1- seismogenic portion plate interface mostly offshore currently locked inferred geodetic data4- however episodic surface displacements direction opposite long-term deformation motions caused relative plate convergence across locked interface observed every months unusual tremor-like seismic signature7- show tremors distributed depth range exceeding km within limited horizontal band many occurred within close strong seismic reflectors plate interface local earthquakes absent suggesting seismogenic process tremors fluid-related observed depth range implies tremors associated variation stress field induced transient slip along deeper portion cascadia interface alternatively episodic slip diffuse originally suggested
