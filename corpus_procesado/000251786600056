comprehensive phylogeny beetles reveals evolutionary origins superradiation 
beetles represent almost one fourth described species knowledge relationships evolution adds understanding biodiversity performed comprehensive phylogenetic analysis coleoptera inferred three genes nearly species representing % worlds recognized beetle families defined basal relationships polyphaga supergroup contains species established five families earliest branching lineages dating phylogeny found success beetles explained neither exceptional net diversification rates predominant role herbivory cretaceous rise angiosperms instead pre cretaceous origin present day lineages suggests beetle species richness due high survival lineages sustained diversification variety niches
