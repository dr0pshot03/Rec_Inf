folding intrinsically disordered protein phosphorylation regulatory switch
intrinsically disordered proteins play important roles cell signalling transcription translation cell cycle regulation although lack stable tertiary structure many intrinsically disordered proteins undergo disorder-to-order transitions upon binding partners similarly several folded proteins use regulated order-to-disorder transitions mediate biological function principle function intrinsically disordered proteins may controlled post-translational modifications lead structural changes folding although observed show multisite phosphorylation induces folding intrinsically disordered 4e-bp2 major neural isoform family three mammalian proteins bind eif4e suppress cap-dependent translation initiation non-phosphorylated state 4e-bp2 interacts tightly eif4e using canonical yxxxxl phi motif starting y54 undergoes disorder-to-helix transition upon binding dynamic secondary binding site- demonstrate phosphorylation t37 t46 induces folding residues p18-r62 4e-bp2 four-stranded beta-domain sequesters helical yxxxxl phi motif partly buried beta-strand blocking accessibility eif4e folded state pt37pt46 4e-bp2 wealdy stable decreasing affinity fold leading order-to-disorder transition upon binding eif4e whereas fully phosphorylated 4e-bp2 stable decreasing affinity factor approximately results highlight stabilization phosphorylation-induced fold essential mechanism phospho-regulation 4e-bp:eif4e interaction exemplify new mode biological regulation mediated intrinsically disordered proteins
