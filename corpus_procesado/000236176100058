cd69 acts downstream interferon-alpha/beta inhibit s1p1 lymphocyte egress lymphoid organs 
naive lymphocytes continually enter exit lymphoid organs recirculation process essential immune surveillance immune responses egress process can shut transiently1 occurs locally increases lymphocyte numbers responding lymphoid organ; occurs systemically can lead immunosuppression result depletion recirculating lymphocytes several mediators innate immune system known cause shutdown including interferon alpha/beta ifn-alpha/beta tumour necrosis factor2- mechanism unclear show treatment ifn-alpha/beta inducer polyinosine polycytidylic acid hereafter polyi:c inhibited egress mechanism partly lymphocyte-intrinsic transmembrane c-type lectin cd69 rapidly induced cd69-/- cells poorly retained lymphoid tissues treatment polyi:c infection lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus lymphocyte egress requires sphingosine -phosphate receptor- s1p1 ifn-alpha/beta found inhibit lymphocyte responsiveness s1p contrast cd69-/- cells retained s1p1 function exposure ifn-alpha/beta coexpression experiments cd69 inhibited s1p1 chemotactic function led downmodulation s1p1 reporter assay s1p1 crosslinking led co-crosslinking activation cd69-cd3 zeta chimaera cd69 co-immunoprecipitated s1p1 related receptor s1p3 observations indicate cd69 forms complex negatively regulates s1p1 functions downstream ifn-alpha/beta possibly activating stimuli promote lymphocyte retention lymphoid organs
