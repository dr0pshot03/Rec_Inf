obligate diploid candida albicans forms mating-competent haploids 
candida albicans prevalent human fungal pathogen considered obligate diploid carries recessive lethal mutations throughout genome demonstrate c albicans viable haploid state can derived diploid cells vitro vivo conditions seems arise concerted chromosome loss mechanism haploids undergo morphogenetic changes like diploids including yeast-hyphal transition chlamydospore formation white-opaque switch facilitates mating haploid opaque cells opposite mating type mate efficiently regenerate diploid form restoring heterozygosity fitness homozygous diploids arise spontaneously auto-diploidization haploids auto-diploids show similar reduction fitness vitro vivo relative heterozygous diploids indicating homozygous cell types transient mixed populations finally constructed stable haploid strains multiple auxotrophies will facilitate molecular genetic analyses important pathogen
