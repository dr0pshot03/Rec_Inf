cavitation-induced reactions high-pressure carbon dioxide
feasibility ultrasound-induced situ radical formation liquid carbon dioxide demonstrated required threshold pressure cavitation exceeded relatively low acoustic intensity high vapor pressure co2 counteracts hydrostatic pressure use dynamic bubble model formation hot spots upon bubble collapse predicted cavitation-induced radical formation used polymerization methyl methacrylate co2 yielding high-molecular-weight polymers results show sonochemical reactions can performed dense-phase fluids allows environmentally benign co2 replace conventional organic solvents many reaction systems
