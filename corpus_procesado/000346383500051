regulation rna polymerase ii activation histone acetylation single living cells
eukaryotic cells post-translational histone modifications important role gene regulation starting early work histone acetylation variety residue-specific modifications now linked rna polymerase ii rnap2 activity remains unclear markers active regulators transcription just passive byproducts studies traditionally relied fixed cell populations meaning temporal resolution limited minutes best correlated factors may actually present cell time complementary approaches therefore needed probe dynamic interplay histone modifications rnap2 higher temporal resolution single living cells address problem developing system track residue-specific histone modifications rnap2 phosphorylation living cells fluorescence microscopy increases temporal resolution tens-of-seconds range single-cell analysis reveals histone h3 lysine acetylation gene locus can alter downstream transcription kinetics much % affecting two temporally separate events first acetylation enhances search kinetics transcriptional activators later acetylation accelerates transition rnap2 initiation elongation signatures latter can found genome-wide using chromatin immunoprecipitation followed sequencing argue regulation leads robust potentially tunable transcriptional response
