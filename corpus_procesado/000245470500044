single igf1 allele major determinant small size dogs 
domestic dog exhibits greater diversity body size terrestrial vertebrate used strategy exploits breed structure dogs investigate genetic basis size first genome-wide scan identified major quantitative trait locus qtl chromosome influencing size variation within single breed second examined genetic variation -megabase interval surrounding qtl small giant breeds found marked evidence selective sweep spanning single gene igf1 encoding insulin-like growth factor single igf1 single-nucleotide polymorphism haplotype common small breeds nearly absent giant breeds suggesting causal sequence variant major contributor body size small dogs
