distinct types diffuse large b-cell lymphoma identified gene expression profiling
diffuse large b-cell lymphoma dlbcl common subtype non-hodgkins lymphoma clinically heterogeneous: % patients respond well current therapy prolonged survival whereas remainder succumb disease proposed variability natural history reflects unrecognized molecular heterogeneity tumours using dna microarrays conducted systematic characterization gene expression b-cell malignancies show diversity gene expression among tumours dlbcl patients apparently reflecting variation tumour proliferation rate host response differentiation state tumour identified two molecularly distinct forms dlbcl gene expression patterns indicative different stages b-cell differentiation one type expressed genes characteristic germinal centre b cells germinal centre b-like dlbcl second type expressed genes normally induced vitro activation peripheral blood b cells activated b-like dlbcl patients germinal centre b-like dlbcl significantly better overall survival activated b-like dlbcl molecular classification tumours basis gene expression can thus identify previously undetected clinically significant subtypes cancer
