cilia-like beating active microtubule bundles
mechanism drives regular beating individual cilia flagella well dense ciliary fields remains unclear describe minimal model system composed microtubules molecular motors self-assemble active bundles exhibiting beating patterns reminiscent found eukaryotic cilia flagella observations suggest hundreds molecular motors acting within elastic microtubule bundle spontaneously synchronize activity generate large-scale oscillations furthermore also demonstrate densely packed actively bending bundles spontaneously synchronize beating patterns produce collective behavior similar metachronal waves observed ciliary fields simple vitro system described provide insights beating isolated eukaryotic cilia flagella well synchronization dense ciliary fields
