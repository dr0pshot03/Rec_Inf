observation polymer conformation hysteresis extensional flow
highly extensible escherichia coli dna molecules planar extensional flow visualized dilute solution fluorescence microscopy narrow range flow strengths molecules found either coiled highly extended conformation depending deformation history polymer conformation hysteresis persists many polymer relaxation times due conformation-dependent hydrodynamic forces polymer conformational free-energy landscapes calculated computer simulations show two free-energy minima flow strengths near coil-stretch transition hysteresis cycles may directly influence bulk-solution stresses development stress-strain relations dilute polymer flows
