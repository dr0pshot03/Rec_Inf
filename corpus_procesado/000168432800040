atomic-beam alignment inorganic materials liquid-crystal displays 
technique used align liquid crystals-rubbing surface substrate liquid crystal subsequently deposited--has perfected multibillion-dollar liquid-crystal display industry however widely recognized non-contact alignment technique highly desirable future generations large high-resolution liquid-crystal displays number alternative alignment techniques reported- none far implemented large-scale manufacturing report non-contact alignment process uses low-energy ion beams impinging glancing angle amorphous inorganic films diamondlike carbon using approach produced laptop desktop displays pilot-line manufacturing found displays higher quality reliability made lower cost rubbing technique mechanism alignment explained adopting random network model atomic arrangement inorganic films order induced exposure ion beam unfavourably oriented rings atoms selectively destroyed planes remaining rings predominantly parallel direction ion beam
