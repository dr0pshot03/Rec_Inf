erasable electrostatic lithography quantum components
quantum electronic components-such quantum antidots one-dimensional channels-are usually defined doped gaas/algaas heterostructures using electron-beam lithography local oxidation conductive atomic force microscopy cases lithography measurement performed different environments fabrication test cycles can take several weeks describe different lithographic technique call erasable electrostatic lithography eel patterns charge drawn device surface negatively biased scanning probe low-temperature high-vacuum environment used measurement charge patterns locally deplete electrons subsurface two-dimensional electron system 2des define working quantum components charge patterns erased locally scanning probe biased positive globally illuminating device red light demonstrate investigate eel drawing erasing quantum antidots develop technique draw tune high-quality one-dimensional channels quantum components imaged using scanned gate microscopy-a technique similar eel reported previously tip-induced charging surface donor layer used locally perturb 2des charge accumulation imaging
