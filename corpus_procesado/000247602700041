dopamine-mushroom body circuit regulates saliency-based decision-making drosophila 
drosophila melanogaster can make appropriate choices among alternative flight options basis relative salience competing visual cues show choice behavior consists early late phases former requires activation dopaminergic system mushroom bodies whereas latter independent activities immunohistological analysis showed mushroom bodies densely innervated dopaminergic axons thus circuit dopamine system mushroom bodies crucial choice behavior drosophila
