xk-related protein ced promote phosphatidylserine exposure apoptotic cells
classic feature apoptotic cells cell-surface exposure phosphatidylserine ptdser eat signal engulfment show xk-family protein xkr8 mediates ptdser exposure response apoptotic stimuli mouse xkr8-/- cells human cancer cells xkr8 expression repressed hypermethylation failed expose ptdser apoptosis inefficiently engulfed phagocytes xkr8 activated directly caspases required caspase cleavage site function ced- caenorhabditis elegans xk-family homolog also promoted apoptotic ptdser exposure cell-corpse engulfment thus xk-family proteins evolutionarily conserved roles promoting phagocytosis dying cells altering phospholipid distribution plasma membrane
