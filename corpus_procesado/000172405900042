pressure-induced amorphization amorphous-amorphous transition densified porous silicon 
crystalline amorphous forms silicon principal materials used solid-state electronics photovoltaics technologies silicon therefore well-studied material although new structures properties still discovered- compression bulk silicon tetrahedrally coordinated atmospheric pressure results transition octahedrally coordinated metallic phases compressed nanocrystalline si particles initial diamond structure persists higher pressure bulk material transforming high-density crystals report compression experiments films porous si contains nanometre-sized domains diamond-structured material- pressures larger gpa observed pressure-induced amorphization furthermore rnd raman spectroscopy measurements high-density amorphous form obtained process transforms low-density amorphous silicon upon decompression amorphous-amorphous transition remarkably similar reported previously water suggests underlying transition high-density low-density liquid phase supercooled si refs si melting temperature decreases increasing pressure crystalline semiconductor melts metallic liquid average coordination similar to5 ref
