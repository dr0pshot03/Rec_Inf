melatonin suppresses nighttime memory formation zebrafish
memory processes modulated biological clock although mechanisms unknown report diurnal zebrafish learning memory formation operant conditioning paradigm occur better day night melatonin treatment day mimics nighttime suppression memory formation training constant light improves nighttime memory formation reducing endogenous melatonin concentrations treatment melatonin receptor antagonists night dramatically improves memory pinealectomy also significantly improves nighttime memory formation adduce melatonin sufficient necessary poor memory formation night
