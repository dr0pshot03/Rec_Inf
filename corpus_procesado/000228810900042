experimental verification designer surface plasmons
studied microwave reflectivity structured near perfectly conducting substrate designed verify existence theoretically proposed new class surface mode measurements modes dispersion curve show correctly approaches predicted asymptotic frequency curve also agrees well derived computer simulation modeling field distribution resonance provides evidence strong localization electric field interface substantial power flow along interface thus verifying surface plasmon-like nature mode
