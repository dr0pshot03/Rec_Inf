electronic read-out single nuclear spin using molecular spin transistor
quantum control individual spins condensed-matter devices emerging field wide range applications nanospintronics quantum computing electron possessing spin orbital degrees freedom conventionally used carrier quantum information proposed devices however electrons couple strongly environment short relaxation coherence times therefore extremely difficult achieve quantum coherence stable entanglement electron spins alternative concepts propose nuclear spins building blocks quantum computing spins extremely well isolated environment less prone decoherence however weak coupling comes price: remains challenging address manipulate individual nuclear spins show nuclear spin individual metal atom embedded single-molecule magnet can read electronically observed long lifetimes tens seconds relaxation characteristics nuclear spin single-atom scale open way completely new world devices quantum logic may implemented
