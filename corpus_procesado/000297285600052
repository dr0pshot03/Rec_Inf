somatic retrotransposition alters genetic landscape human brain
retrotransposons mobile genetic elements use germline copy-and-paste mechanism spread throughout metazoan genomes least per cent human genome derived retrotransposons three active families l1 alu sva associated insertional mutagenesis disease epigenetic post-transcriptional suppression block retrotransposition somatic cells excluding early embryo development malignancies recent reports l1 expression copy number variation human brain suggest l1 mobilization may also occur later development however corresponding integration sites mapped apply high-throughput method identify numerous l1 alu sva germline mutations well putative somatic l1 insertions hippocampus caudate nucleus three individuals surprisingly also found somatic alu insertions sva insertions results demonstrate retrotransposons mobilize protein-coding genes differentially expressed active brain thus somatic genome mosaicism driven retrotransposition may reshape genetic circuitry underpins normal abnormal neurobiological processes
