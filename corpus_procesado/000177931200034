magnetar-like x-ray bursts anomalous x-ray pulsar 
anomalous x-ray pulsars axps class rare x-ray emitting pulsars whose energy source perplexing years- unlike x-ray emitting pulsars axps powered rotational energy accretion matter binary companion star hence designation `anomalous many rotational radiative properties axps strikingly similar another class exotic objects soft-gamma-ray repeaters sgrs defining property sgrs-their low-energy-gamma-ray x-ray bursts-has hitherto observed axps soft-gamma-ray repeaters thought magnetars young neutron stars whose emission powered decay ultra-high magnetic field suggestion axps might also magnetars controversial report two x-ray bursts properties similar sgrs direction anomalous x-ray pulsar 1e1048- events imply close relationship perhaps evolutionary axps sgrs magnetars
