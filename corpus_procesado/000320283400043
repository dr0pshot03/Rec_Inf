heat dissipation atomic-scale junctions 
atomic single-molecule junctions represent ultimate limit miniaturization electrical circuits1 also ideal platforms testing quantum transport theories required describe charge energy transfer novel functional nano-metre-scale devices recent work successfully probed electric thermoelectric phenomena2- atomic-scale junctions however heat dissipation transport atomic-scale devices remain poorly characterized owing experimental challenges use custom-fabricated scanning probes integrated nanoscale thermocouples investigate heat dissipation electrodes single-molecule molecular junctions find junctions transmission characteristics strongly energy dependent heat dissipation asymmetric-that unequal electrodes-and also dependent bias polarity identity majority charge carriers electrons versus holes contrast junctions consisting gold atoms atomic junctions whose transmission characteristics show weak energy dependence exhibit appreciable asymmetry results unambiguously relate electronic transmission characteristics atomic-scale junctions heat dissipation properties establishing framework understanding heat dissipation range mesoscopic systems transport elastic-that without exchange energy contact region anticipate techniques established will enable study peltier effects atomic scale field barely explored experimentally despite interesting theoretical predictions9- furthermore experimental advances described also expected enable study heat transport atomic molecular junctions-an important challenging scientific technological goal remained elusive1213
