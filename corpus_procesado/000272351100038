mantle shear-wave velocity structure beneath hawaiian hot spot
defining mantle structure lies beneath hot spots important revealing depth origin three-dimensional images shear-wave velocity beneath hawaiian islands obtained network sea-floor land seismometers show upper-mantle low-velocity anomaly elongated direction island chain surrounded parabola-shaped high-velocity anomaly low velocities continue downward mantle transition zone kilometers depth result agreement prior observations transition-zone thinning inclusion sks observations extends resolution downward depth kilometers reveals several-hundred-kilometer-wide region low velocities beneath southeast hawaii images suggest hawaiian hot spot result upwelling high-temperature plume lower mantle
