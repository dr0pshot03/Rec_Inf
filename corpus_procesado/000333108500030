super-eddington mechanical power accreting black hole m83
mass accretion onto black holes releases energy form radiation outflows although radiative flux substantially exceed eddington limit outgoing radiation pressure impedes inflow matter remains unclear whether kinetic energy flux bounded limit present detection radio-optical structure powered outflows non-nuclear black hole accretion disk properties indicate black hole less solar masses optical-infrared line emission implies average kinetic power x erg second- higher eddington luminosity black hole results demonstrate kinetic power exceeding eddington limit sustained period implies greater ability influence evolution black holes environment
