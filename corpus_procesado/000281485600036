junctional adhesion molecule jaml costimulatory receptor epithelial gamma delta t cell activation 
gamma delta t cells present epithelial tissues provide crucial first line defense environmental insults including infection trauma malignancy yet molecular events surrounding activation remain poorly defined identify epithelial gamma delta t cell-specific costimulatory molecule junctional adhesion molecule-like protein jaml binding jaml ligand coxsackie adenovirus receptor car provides costimulation leading cellular proliferation cytokine growth factor production inhibition jaml costimulation leads diminished gamma delta t cell activation delayed wound closure akin seen absence gamma delta t cells results identify jaml crucial component epithelial gamma delta t cell biology broader implications car jaml tissue homeostasis repair
