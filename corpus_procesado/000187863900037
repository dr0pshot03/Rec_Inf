vernalization requires epigenetic silencing flc histone methylation 
ensure flowering favourable conditions many plants flower extended period cold namely winter arabidopsis acceleration flowering prolonged cold process called vernalization involves downregulation protein flc otherwise prevent flowering lowered flc expression maintained subsequent development activity vernalization vrn genes vrn1 encodes dna-binding protein whereas vrn2 encodes homologue one polycomb group proteins maintain silencing genes animal development show vernalization causes changes histone methylation discrete domains within flc locus increasing dimethylation lysines histone h3 modifications identify silenced chromatin states drosophila human cells- dimethylation h3 k27 lost vrn2 mutants dimethylation h3 k9 absent vrn1 vrn2 consistent vrn1 functioning downstream vrn2 epigenetic memory winter thus mediated histone code specifies silent chromatin state conserved animals plants
