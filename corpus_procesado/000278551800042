lead isotopic age earth can explained core formation alone 
meaning age earth defined lead isotopes long unclear recently proposed age earth deduced lead isotopes reflects volatile loss space time moon-forming giant impact rather partitioning metallic liquids protracted core formation show lead partitioning liquid iron depends strongly carbon content given content similar % carbon experimental isotopic data provide evidence strong partitioning lead core throughout earths accretion earlier conclusions lead weakly partitioned iron arose use carbon-saturated % c iron alloys lead isotopic age earth therefore consistent partitioning core significant late losses moderately volatile elements space giant impact
