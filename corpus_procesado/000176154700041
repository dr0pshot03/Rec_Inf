mycorrhizal weathering apatite important calcium source base-poor forest ecosystems
depletion calcium forest ecosystems northeastern usa- thought consequence acidic deposition present restricting recovery forest aquatic systems- now acidic deposition declining depletion calcium inferred studies- showing sources calcium forest ecosystems-namely atmospheric deposition mineral weathering silicate rocks plagioclase calcium-sodium silicate-do match calcium outputs observed forest streams therefore thought calcium lost exchangeable organically bound calcium forest soils investigate sources calcium hubbard brook experimental forest analysis calcium strontium abundances strontium isotope ratios within various soil vegetation hydrological pools show dissolution apatite calcium phosphate represents source calcium comparable size known inputs atmospheric sources silicate weathering moreover apatite-derived calcium utilized largely ectomycorrhizal tree species suggesting mycorrhizae may weather apatite absorb released ions directly without ions entering exchangeable soil pool therefore seems apatite weathering can compensate calcium lost base-poor ecosystems considered estimating soil acidification impacts calcium cycling
