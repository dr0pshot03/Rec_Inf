control nitrogen export watersheds headwater streams 
comparative n--tracer study nitrogen dynamics headwater streams biomes throughout north america demonstrates streams exert control nutrient exports rivers lakes estuaries rapid uptake transformation inorganic nitrogen occurred smallest streams ammonium entering streams removed water within tens hundreds meters nitrate also removed stream water traveled distance times long average ammonium despite low ammonium concentration stream water nitrification rates high indicating small streams potentially important sources atmospheric nitrous oxide seasons high biological activity reaches headwater streams typically export downstream less half input dissolved inorganic nitrogen watersheds
