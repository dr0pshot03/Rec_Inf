contribution single synapses sensory representation vivo
extent synaptic activity can signal sensory stimulus limits information available neuron determined contribution individual synapses sensory representation recording excitatory postsynaptic currents epscs cerebellar granule cells time varying quantifiable vestibular stimulus vestibular sensitive synapses faithfully reported direction velocity rather position acceleration whole body motion via bidirectional modulation epsc frequency lack short term synaptic dynamics ensured highly linear relationship velocity charge transfer synapses provided resolution approaching psychophysical limits indicates highly accurate stimulus representation can achieved small networks even within single neurons
