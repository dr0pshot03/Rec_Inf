measurement confinement induced neutron phase 
particle physicists see neutrons tiny massive particles confinement radius fm distinct internal quark-gluon structure quantum mechanics neutrons described wave packets whose spatial extent may become ten orders magnitude larger confinement radius can even reach macroscopic dimensions depending degree monochromaticity neutrons passing narrow slits predicted12 quantization transverse momentum component changes longitudinal momentum component resulting phase shift measurable using interferometric methods3 use neutron interferometry measure phase shift arising lateral confinement neutron beam passing narrow slit system phase shift arises mainly neutrons whose classical trajectories touch walls slits respect non-locality quantum physics apparent
