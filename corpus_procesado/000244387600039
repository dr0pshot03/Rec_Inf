regulation drosophila life span olfaction food-derived odors
smell ancient sensory system present organisms bacteria humans nematode caeonorhabditis elegans gustatory olfactory neurons regulate aging longevity using fruit fly drosophila melanogaster showed exposure nutrient-derived odorants can modulate life span partially reverse longevity-extending effects dietary restriction furthermore mutation odorant receptor or83b resulted severe olfactory defects altered adult metabolism enhanced stress resistance extended life span findings indicate olfaction affects adult physiology aging drosophila possibly perceived availability nutritional resources olfactory regulation life span evolutionarily conserved
