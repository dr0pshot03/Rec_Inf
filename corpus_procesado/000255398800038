mapping sequencing structural variation eight human genomes
genetic variation among individual humans occurs many different scales ranging gross alterations human karyotype single nucleotide changes explore variation intermediate scale particularly insertions deletions inversions affecting thousand million base pairs employed clone based method interrogate intermediate structural variation eight individuals diverse geographic ancestry analysis provides comprehensive overview normal pattern structural variation present genomes refining location structural variants find % seen one individual nearly half lay outside regions genome previously described structurally variant discover new insertion sequences present human reference genome show many variable copy number individuals complete sequencing structural variants reveals considerable locus complexity provides insights different mutational processes shaped human genome data provide first high resolution sequence map human structural variation standard genotyping platforms prelude future individual genome sequencing projects
