involvement anterior cingulate cortex remote contextual fear memory
although molecular cellular systems mechanisms required initial memory processing intensively investigated underlying permanent memory storage remain elusive present neuroanatomical pharmacological genetic results demonstrating anterior cingulate cortex plays critical role remote memory contextual fear conditioning imaging activity-dependent genes shows anterior cingulate activated remote memory activation impaired null alpha-camkii mutation blocks remote memory accordingly reversible inactivation structure normal mice disrupts remote memory without affecting recent memory
