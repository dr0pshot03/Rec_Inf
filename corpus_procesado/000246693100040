single-exciton optical gain semiconductor nanocrystals
nanocrystal quantum dots favourable light-emitting properties show photoluminescence high quantum yields emission colours depend nanocrystal size owing quantum-confinement effect therefore tunable however nanocrystals difficult use optical amplification lasing almost exact balance absorption stimulated emission nanoparticles excited single electron hole pairs excitons optical gain can occur nanocrystals contain least two excitons complication associated multiexcitonic nature light amplification fast optical-gain decay induced non-radiative auger recombination process one exciton recombines transferring energy another demonstrate practical approach obtaining optical gain single-exciton regime eliminates problem auger decay specifically develop core/ shell hetero-nanocrystals engineered way spatially separate electrons holes core shell type-ii heterostructures resulting imbalance negative positive charges produces strong local electric field induces giant similar mev greater transient stark shift absorption spectrum respect luminescence line singly excited nanocrystals effect breaks exact balance absorption stimulated emission allows us demonstrate optical amplification due single excitons
