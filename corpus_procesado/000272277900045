hidden alternative structures proline isomerase essential catalysis
long-standing challenge understand atomic level protein dynamics contribute enzyme catalysis x-ray crystallography can provide snapshots conformational substates sampled enzymatic reactions nmr relaxation methods reveal rates interconversion substates corresponding relative populations however current methods simultaneously reveal detailed atomic structures rare states rationalize finding intrinsic motions free enzyme occur timescale similar catalytic turnover rate introduce dual strategies ambient-temperature x-ray crystallographic data collection automated electron-density sampling structurally unravel interconverting substates human proline isomerase cyclophilin cypa also known ppia conservative mutation outside active site designed stabilize features previously hidden minor conformation mutation inverts equilibrium substates also causes large parallel reductions conformational interconversion rates catalytic rate studies introduce crystallographic approaches define functional minor protein conformations combination nmr analysis enzyme dynamics solution show collective motions directly contribute catalytic power enzyme
