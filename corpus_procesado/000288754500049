bonding electron density aluminum 
aluminum considered approach "ideal" metal free electron gas valence electrons move freely unaffected presence metal ions therefore electron redistribution due chemical bonding subtle proven extremely difficult determine experimental measurements ab initio calculations yielded substantially different results applied quantitative convergent-beam electron diffraction aluminum provide experimental determination bonding electron distribution calculation electron distribution based density functional theory shown close agreement results yield accurate quantitative correlation anisotropic elastic properties aluminum bonding electron electrostatic potential distributions
