phenomenological description space-time noise quantum gravity
space-time foam geometric picture smallest size scales universe characterized mainly presence quantum uncertainties measurement distances quantum-gravity theories predict kind foam description properties foam varies according theory thereby providing possible means distinguishing theories previously showed foam-induced distance fluctuations introduce new source noise measurements gravity-wave interferometers theories insufficiently developed permit detailed predictions use experimentalists propose phenomenological approach directly describes space-time foam leads naturally picture distance fluctuations independent details interferometer unknown model length scale sets overall magnitude effect recent data already rule possibility length scale identified string length - m < l-s < - m length scales even smaller planck length l-p approximate - m will soon probed experimentally
