approaching disorder-free transport high-mobility conjugated polymers 
conjugated polymers enable production flexible semiconductor devices can processed solution low temperatures past years device performance improved greatly wide variety molecular structures studied1 however one major limitation overcome; transport properties polymer films still limited pervasive conformational energetic disorder2- limits rational design materials higher performance also prevents study physical phenomena associated extended pi-electron delocalization along polymer backbone report comparative transport study several high-mobility conjugated polymers field-effect-modulated seebeck transistor sub-bandgap optical absorption measurements show several polymers notably recently reported indacenodithiophene-based donor-acceptor copolymer near-amorphous microstructure6 charge transport properties approach intrinsic disorder-free limits molecular sites thermally accessible molecular dynamics simulations identify origin long sought-after regime planar torsion-free backbone conformation surprisingly resilient side-chain disorder results provide molecular-design guidelines disorder-free conjugated polymers
