pseudomonas sax genes overcome aliphatic isothiocyanate-mediated non-host resistance arabidopsis 
plant-microbe interactions result disease natural products restrict non-host pathogens found sulforaphane -methylsulfinylbutyl isothiocyanate natural product derived aliphatic glucosinolates inhibits growth arabidopsis non-host pseudomonas bacteria planta multiple sax genes saxcab/f/d/g identified pseudomonas species virulent arabidopsis sax genes required overwhelm isothiocyanate-based defenses facilitate disease outcome especially young leaves critical plant survival introduction saxcab genes non-host strains enabled overcome arabidopsis defenses study shows aliphatic isothiocyanates previously shown limit damage herbivores also crucial robust developmentally regulated defenses underpin non-host resistance arabidopsis-pseudomonas pathosystem
