dynamic ma mrna methylation directs translational control heat shock response 
abundant mrna post-transcriptional modification n--methyladenosine ma broad roles rna biology- mammalian cells asymmetric distribution ma along mrnas results relatively less methylation untranslated region utr compared regions however whether utr methylation regulated poorly understood despite crucial role utr translation initiation little known whether ma modification influences mrna translation show response heat shock stress certain adenosines within utr newly transcribed mrnas preferentially methylated wefind dynamic utr methylation result stress-induced nuclear localization ythdf2 well-characterized ma reader upon heat shock stress nuclear ythdf2 preserves utr methylation stress-induced transcripts limiting ma eraser fto demethylation remarkably increased utr methylation form ma promotes cap-independent translation initiation providing mechanism selective mrna translation heat shock stress using hsp70 mrna example demonstrate single ma modification site utr enables translation initiation independent end n--methylguanosine cap elucidation dynamic features utr methylation critical role cap-independent translation expands breadth physiological roles ma also uncovers previously unappreciated translational control mechanism heat shock response
