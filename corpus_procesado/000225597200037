bose-einstein condensation excitons bilayer electron systems
exciton particle-like entity forms electron bound positively charged hole ordered electronic state excitons condense single quantum state proposed theoretical possibility many years ago review recent studies semiconductor bilayer systems provide clear evidence phenomenon explain exciton condensation quantum hall regime experiments performed likely occur electron electron bilayers electron hole bilayers current quantum hall excitonic condensates disorder induces mobile vortices flow response supercurrent limit extremely large bilayer counterflow conductivity
