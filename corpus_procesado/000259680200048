high-quality binary protein interaction map yeast interactome network 
current yeast interactome network maps contain several hundred molecular complexes limited somewhat controversial representation direct binary interactions carried comparative quality assessment current yeast interactome data sets demonstrating high throughput yeast two hybrid y2h screening provides high quality binary interaction information large fraction yeast binary interactome remains mapped developed empirically controlled mapping framework produce "second generation" high quality high throughput y2h data set covering similar % yeast binary interactions y2h affinity purification followed mass spectrometry ap/ ms data equally high quality fundamentally different complementary nature resulting networks different topological biological properties compared co complex interactome models binary map enriched transient signaling interactions intercomplex connections highly significant clustering essential proteins rather correlating essentiality protein connectivity correlates genetic pleiotropy
