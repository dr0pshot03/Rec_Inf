whisker movements evoked stimulation single pyramidal cells rat motor cortex 
neuronal activity motor cortex understood correlated movements impact action potentials aps single cortical neurons generation movement fully determined show trains aps single pyramidal cells rat motor cortex can evoke long sequences small whisker movements layer- pyramids find evoked rhythmic movements constant phase relative ap train indicating single layer- pyramids can reset rhythm whisker movements action potentials evoked layer- pyramids can generate bursts rhythmic whisking variable phase movements relative ap train increasing number aps decreases latency onset movement whereas ap frequency determines movement direction amplitude find efficacy cortical aps evoking whisker movements dependent background cortical activity greatly enhanced waking rats conclude vibrissae motor cortex sparse ap activity can evoke movements
