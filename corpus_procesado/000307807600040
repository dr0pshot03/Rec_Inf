-second quasi-periodicity tidal disruption star dormant black hole 
supermassive black holes smbhs; mass greater approximately times sun known exist center galaxies sufficient stellar mass local universe possible infer properties surrounding stars gas however high redshifts require active continuous accretion infer presence smbhs often comes form long-term accretion active galactic nuclei smbhs can also capture tidally disrupt stars orbiting nearby resulting bright flares otherwise quiescent black holes report similar -second x-ray quasi-periodicity around previously dormant smbh located center galaxy redshift z result may open possibility probing general relativity beyond local universe
