fluorescent false neurotransmitters visualize dopamine release individual presynaptic terminals
nervous system transmits signals neurons via neurotransmitter release synaptic vesicle fusion order observe neurotransmitter uptake release individual presynaptic terminals directly designed fluorescent false neurotransmitters substrates synaptic vesicle monoamine transporter using probes image dopamine release striatum made several observations pertinent synaptic plasticity found fraction synaptic vesicles releasing neurotransmitter per stimulus dependent stimulus frequency kinetically distinct reserve synaptic vesicle population observed experimental conditions frequency-dependent heterogeneity presynaptic terminals revealed dependent part d2 dopamine receptors indicating mechanism frequency-dependent coding presynaptic selection
