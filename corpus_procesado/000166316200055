improving enzymes using organic solvents
technological utility enzymes can enhanced greatly using organic solvents rather natural aqueous reaction media studies past years revealed change solvent feasible also seemingly hostile environments enzymes can catalyse reactions impossible water become stable exhibit new behaviour `molecular memory particular importance discovery enzymatic selectivity including substrate stereo- regio chemoselectivity can markedly affected sometimes even inverted solvent enzyme-catalysed reactions organic solvents even supercritical fluids gas phase found numerous potential applications already commercialized
