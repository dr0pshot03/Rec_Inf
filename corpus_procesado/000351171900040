polyploidy can drive rapid adaptation yeast 
polyploidy observed across tree life yet influence evolution remains incompletely understood1- polyploidy usually whole-genome duplication proposed alter rate evolutionary adaptation occur complex effects frequency fitness beneficial mutations25- example diverse cell types organisms immediately whole-genome duplication newly formed polyploids missegregate chromosomes undergo genetic instability8- instability following wholegenome duplications thought provide adaptive mutations microorganisms1314 can promote tumorigenesis mammalian cells1115 polyploidy may also affect adaptation independently beneficial mutations ploidy-specific changes cell physiology16 perform vitro evolution experiments test directly whether polyploidy can accelerate evolutionary adaptation compared haploids diploids tetraploids undergo significantly faster adaptation mathematical modelling suggests rapid adaptation tetraploids driven higher rates beneficial mutations stronger fitness effects supported whole-genome sequencing phenotypic analyses evolved clones chromosome aneuploidy concerted chromosome loss point mutations provide large fitness gains identify several mutations whose beneficial effects manifest specifically tetraploid strains together results provide direct quantitative evidence environments polyploidy can accelerate evolutionary adaptation
