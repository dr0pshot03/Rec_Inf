coherent state transfer itinerant microwave fields mechanical oscillator 
macroscopic mechanical oscillators coaxed regime quantum behaviour direct refrigeration combination refrigeration laser-like cooling result supports idea mechanical oscillators may perform useful functions processing quantum information superconducting circuits- either serving quantum memory ephemeral state microwave field providing quantum interface otherwise incompatible systems- yet transfer itinerant state propagating mode microwave field storage medium demonstrated owing inability turn interaction microwave field medium sufficiently quickly demonstrate state itinerant microwave field can coherently transferred stored retrieved mechanical oscillator amplitudes single-quantum level crucially time capture retrieve microwave state shorter quantum state lifetime mechanical oscillator quantum regime mechanical oscillator can store quantum information enable transfer otherwise incompatible systems
