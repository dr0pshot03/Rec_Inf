achieving stability lipopolysaccharide-induced nf-kappa b activation 
activation dynamics transcription factor nf-kappa b exhibit damped oscillatory behavior cells stimulated tumor necrosis factor-alpha tnf alpha stable behavior stimulated lipopolysaccharide lps lps binding toll-like receptor tlr4 causes activation nf-kappa b requires two downstream pathways isolated exhibits damped oscillatory behavior computational modeling two tlr4-dependent signaling pathways suggests one pathway requires time delay establish early antiphase activation nf-kappa b two pathways myd88-independent pathway required inferon regulatory factor dependent expression tnf alpha activate nf-kappa b time required tnf alpha synthesis established delay
