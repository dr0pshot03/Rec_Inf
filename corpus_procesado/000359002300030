rna degradation paths -subunit nuclear exosome complex 
eukaryotic exosome conserved rna-degrading complex functions rna surveillance turnover processing machinery can either completely degrade precisely trim rna substrates long remained unexplained report crystal structures yeast nuclear exosome containing -subunit core - rnases rrp44 rrp6 obligate rrp6-binding partner rrp47 complex different rnas combined structural biochemical data -subunit complex reveal single-stranded rna can reach rrp44 rrp6 active sites directly can bind rrp6 threaded via central channel towards distal rnase rrp44 bulky rna stalled entrance channel rrp6-rrp47 swings open results suggest molecular machine can coordinate processive degradation partial trimming rna-dependent manner concerted swinging mechanism two rnase subunits
