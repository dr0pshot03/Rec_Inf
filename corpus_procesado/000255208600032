crystal structures dna/rna repair enzymes alkb abh2 bound dsdna
escherichia coli alkb human homologues abh2 abh3 repair dna/ rna base lesions using direct oxidative dealkylation mechanism abh2 primary role guarding mammalian genomes mea damage repairing lesion double stranded dna dsdna whereas alkb abh3 preferentially repair single stranded dna ssdna lesions can repair damaged bases rna show first crystal structures alkb dsdna abh2 dsdna complexes stabilized chemical cross linking strategy study reveals alkb uses unprecedented base flipping mechanism access damaged base: squeezes together two bases flanking flipped one maintain base stack explaining preference alkb repairing ssdna lesions dsdna ones addition first crystal structure abh2 presented provides structural basis designing inhibitors human dna repair protein
