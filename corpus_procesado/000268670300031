mir mir regulate smooth muscle cell fate plasticity 
micrornas mirnas regulators myriad cellular events evidence single mirna can efficiently differentiate multipotent stem cells specific lineage regulate direct reprogramming cells alternative cell fate elusive show mir mir co-transcribed multipotent murine cardiac progenitors becoming localized smooth muscle cells including neural crest stem-cell-derived vascular smooth muscle cells mir mir direct transcriptional targets serum response factor myocardin nkx2 nk2 transcription factor related locus downregulated injured atherosclerotic vessels containing proliferating less differentiated smooth muscle cells mir necessary myocardin-induced reprogramming adult fibroblasts smooth muscle cells sufficient induce differentiation multipotent neural crest stem cells vascular smooth muscle furthermore mir mir cooperatively targeted network transcription factors including klf4 kruppel-like factor myocardin elk elk1 member ets oncogene family promote differentiation repress proliferation smooth muscle cells findings demonstrate mir can direct smooth muscle fate mir mir function regulate quiescent versus proliferative phenotype smooth muscle cells
