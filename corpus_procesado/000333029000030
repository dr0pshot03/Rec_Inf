fully photonics-based coherent radar system 
next generation radar radio detection ranging systems needs based software-defined radio adapt variable environments higher carrier frequencies smaller antennas broadened bandwidth increased resolution1- todays digital microwave components synthesizers analogue-to-digital converters suffer limited bandwidth high noise increasing frequencies5- fully digital radar systems can work gigahertz noisy analogue up-and downconversions necessary higher frequencies contrast photonics provide high precision ultrawide bandwidth89 allowing flexible generation extremely stable radio-frequency signals arbitrary waveforms millimetre waves10- detection signals precise direct digitization without downconversion23- now photonics-based generation detection radio-frequency signals studied separately tested radar system present development field trial results fully photonics-based coherent radar demonstrator carried within project phodir27 proposed architecture exploits single pulsed laser generating tunable radar signals receiving echoes avoiding radio-frequency up-and downconversion guaranteeing software-defined approach high resolution performance exceeds state-of-the-art electronics carrier frequencies two gigahertz detection non-cooperating aeroplanes confirms effectiveness expected precision system
