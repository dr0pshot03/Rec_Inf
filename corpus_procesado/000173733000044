role escherichia coli curli operons directing amyloid fiber formation
amyloid associated debilitating human ailments including alzheimers prion diseases biochemical biophysical imaging analyses revealed fibers produced escherichia coli called curli amyloid csga curlin subunit purified absence csgb nucleator adopted soluble unstructured form upon prolonged incubation assembled fibers indistinguishable curli vivo curli biogenesis dependent nucleation-precipitation machinery requiring csge csgf chaperone-like nucleator proteins respectively unlike eukaryotic amyloid formation curli biogenesis productive pathway requiring specific assembly machinery
