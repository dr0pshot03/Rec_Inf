restoring systemic gdf11 levels reverses age-related dysfunction mouse skeletal muscle
parabiosis experiments indicate impaired regeneration aged mice reversible exposure young circulation suggesting young blood contains humoral rejuvenating factors can restore regenerative function demonstrate circulating protein growth differentiation factor gdf11 rejuvenating factor skeletal muscle supplementation systemic gdf11 levels normally decline age heterochronic parabiosis systemic delivery recombinant protein reversed functional impairments restored genomic integrity aged muscle stem cells satellite cells increased gdf11 levels aged mice also improved muscle structural functional features increased strength endurance exercise capacity data indicate gdf11 systemically regulates muscle aging may therapeutically useful reversing age-related skeletal muscle stem cell dysfunction
