polariton superfluids reveal quantum hydrodynamic solitons
quantum fluid passing obstacle behaves differently classical one flow slow enough quantum gas enters superfluid regime neither whirlpools waves form around obstacle higher flow velocities predicted perturbation induced defect gives rise turbulent emission quantized vortices nucleation solitons using interacting bose gas exciton-polaritons semiconductor microcavity report transition superfluidity hydrodynamic formation oblique dark solitons vortex streets wake potential barrier direct observation topological excitations provides key information mechanisms superflow shows potential polariton condensates quantum turbulence studies
