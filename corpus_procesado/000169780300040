ventroptin: bmp antagonist expressed double-gradient pattern retina
visual system establishment anteroposterior dorsoventral axes retina ana tectum development important topographic retinotectal projection identified chick ventroptin antagonist bone morphogenetic protein bmp- mainly expressed ventral retina ventral high-dorsal low gradient also nasal high-temporal low gradient later stages misexpression ventroptin altered expression patterns several topographic genes retina projection retinal axons tectum along axes thus topographic retinotectal projection appears specified double-gradient molecule ventroptin along two axes
