eemian interglacial reconstructed greenland folded ice core
efforts extract greenland ice core complete record eemian interglacial years ago now unsuccessful response greenland ice sheet warmer-than-present climate eemian thus remained unclear present new north greenland eemian ice drilling neem ice core show modest ice-sheet response strong warming early eemian reconstructed eemian record folded ice using globally homogeneous parameters known dated greenland antarctic ice-core records basis water stable isotopes neem surface temperatures onset eemian years ago peaked +/ degrees celsius mean past millennium followed gradual cooling probably driven decreasing summer insolation years ago thickness northwest greenland ice sheet decreased +/ metres reaching surface elevations years ago +/ metres lower present extensive surface melt occurred neem site eemian phenomenon witnessed melt layers formed neem exceptional heat july additional warming surface melt might become common future
