4d electron diffraction reveals correlated unidirectional behavior zinc oxide nanowires 
confined electronic structure nanoscale materials increasingly shown induce behavior quite distinct bulk analogs direct atomic scale visualization nanowires zinc oxide achieved unique pancake type diffraction using four dimensional 4d ultrafast electron crystallography electronic excitation wide gap photonic material wires found exhibit colossal expansions two orders magnitude higher expected thermal equilibrium; expansion highly anisotropic quasi one dimensional behavior facilitated induced antibonding character reducing density nanowires expansions reach even larger values occur shorter times suggesting decrease structural constraint transient atomic motions unanticipated ultrafast carrier driven expansion highlights optoelectronic consequences nanoscale morphologies
