evolutionary changes cis trans gene regulation
differences gene expression central evolution differences can arise cis-regulatory changes affect transcription initiation transcription rate and/or transcript stability allele-specific manner trans-regulatory changes modify activity expression factors interact cis-regulatory sequences cis trans-regulatory changes contribute divergent gene expression respective contributions remain largely unknown examine distribution cis trans-regulatory changes underlying expression differences closely related drosophila species d melanogaster d simulans show functional cis regulatory differences comparing relative abundance species-specific transcripts f hybrids differences trans-regulatory activity inferred comparing ratio allelic expression hybrids ratio gene expression species genes interspecific expression differences differences cis regulation changes sufficient explain expression divergence half genes trans-regulatory differences affected % genes always accompanied cis-regulatory changes data indicate interspecific expression differences caused select trans-regulatory changes widespread effects rather many cis acting changes spread throughout genome
