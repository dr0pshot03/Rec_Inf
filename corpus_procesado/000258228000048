micrornas expressed herpes simplex virus latent infection regulate viral mrnas
herpesviruses characterized ability maintain lifelong latent infections animal hosts however mechanisms allow establishment maintenance latent state remain poorly understood herpes simplex virus hsv- establishes latency neurons sensory ganglia abundant viral gene product non-coding rna latency associated transcript lat show lat functions primary microrna mirna precursor encodes four distinct mirnas hsv infected cells one mirnas mir-h2-3p transcribed antisense orientation icp0-a viral immediate-early transcriptional activator important productive hsv replication thought role reactivation latency show mir-h2-3p able reduce icp0 protein expression significantly affect icp0 messenger rna levels also identified fifth hsv mirna latently infected trigeminal ganglia mir-h6 derives previously unknown transcript distinct lat mir-h6 shows extended seed complementarity mrna encoding second hsv transcription factor icp4 inhibits expression icp4 required expression hsv genes productive infection results may explain reported ability lat promote latency- thus hsv expresses least two primary mirna precursors latently infected neurons may facilitate establishment maintenance viral latency post-transcriptionally regulating viral gene expression
