beta-defensin mutation causes black coat color domestic dogs 
genetic analysis mammalian color variation provided fundamental insight human biology disease vertebrates two key genes agouti melanocortin receptor mc1r encode ligand-receptor system controls pigment type-switching domestic dogs third gene implicated k locus whose genetic characteristics predict previously unrecognized component melanocortin pathway identify k locus beta-defensin cbd103 show protein product binds high affinity mc1r simple strong effect pigment type-switching domestic dogs transgenic mice results expand functional role beta-defensins protein family previously implicated innate immunity identify additional class ligands signaling melanocortin receptors
