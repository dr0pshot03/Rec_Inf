endogenous activation patterns cdc42 gtpase within drosophila embryos
knowing given protein activated within intact animals assists elucidating vivo function use genetically encoded a-probe activation bioprobe revealed cdc42 guanosine triphosphatase gtpase remains inactive within drosophila embryos first two-thirds embryogenesis within central nervous system cdc42 activity first becomes up-regulated individual neurons display patterns restricted specific subcellular compartments organismal cellular levels cdc42s endogenous activation patterns wild type allow predictions loss-of-function phenotypes will emerge cdc42/cdc42 mutants genetic tests support importance suppressing endogenous cdc42 activities needed thus bioprobe-assisted analysis uncovers ubiquitously expressed signaling proteins control cellular events continual regulation activities within animals
