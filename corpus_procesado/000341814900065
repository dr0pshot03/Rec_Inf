coordinated regulation protein synthesis degradation mtorc1
eukaryotic cells coordinately control anabolic catabolic processes maintain cell tissue homeostasis mechanistic target rapamycin complex mtorc1 promotes nutrient-consuming anabolic processes protein synthesis show well increasing protein synthesis mtorc1 activation mouse human cells also promotes increased capacity protein degradation cells activated mtorc1 exhibited elevated levels intact active proteasomes global increase expression genes encoding proteasome subunits increase proteasome gene expression cellular proteasome content rates protein turnover downstream mtorc1 dependent induction transcription factor nuclear factor erythroid-derived related factor nrf1 also known nfe2l1 genetic activation mtorc1 loss tuberous sclerosis complex tumour suppressors tsc1 tsc2 physiological activation mtorc1 response growth factors feeding resulted increased nrf1 expression cells tissues find nrf1-dependent elevation proteasome levels serves increase intracellular pool amino acids thereby influences rates new protein synthesis therefore mtorc1 signalling increases efficiency proteasome-mediated protein degradation quality control mechanism supply substrate sustained protein synthesis
