reconstruction molecular orbital densities photoemission data
photoemission spectroscopy commonly applied study band structure solids measuring kinetic energy versus angular distribution photoemitted electrons apply experimental technique characterize discrete orbitals large pi-conjugated molecules measuring photoemission intensity constant initial-state energy hemispherical region generate reciprocal space maps emitting orbital density demonstrate real-space electron distribution molecular orbitals crystalline pentacene film chemisorbed p-sexiphenyl monolayer can obtained simple fourier transform measurement data results good agreement density functional calculations
