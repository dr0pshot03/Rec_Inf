cell-cycle-regulated activation akt kinase phosphorylation carboxyl terminus
akt also known protein kinase b plays key roles cell proliferation survival metabolism akt hyperactivation contributes many pathophysiological conditions including human cancers- closely associated poor prognosis chemo-or radio-therapeutic resistance phosphorylation akt s473 ref t308 ref activates akt however remains unclear whether mechanisms account full akt activation whether akt hyperactivation linked misregulated cell cycle progression another cancer hallmark report akt activity fluctuates across cell cycle mirroring cyclin expression mechanistically phosphorylation s477 t479 akt extreme carboxy terminus cyclin-dependent kinase cdk2/cyclin mtorc2 distinct physiological conditions promotes akt activation facilitating functionally compensating s473 phosphorylation furthermore deletion cyclin a2 allele mouse olfactory bulb leads reduced s477/t479 phosphorylation elevated cellular apoptosis notably cyclin a2-deletion-induced cellular apoptosis mouse embryonic stem cells partly rescued s477d/t479e-akt1 supporting physiological role cyclin a2 governing akt activation together results study show akt s477/t479 phosphorylation essential layer akt activation mechanism regulate physiological functions thereby providing new mechanistic link aberrant cell cycle progression akt hyperactivation cancer
