entanglement single-atom quantum bits distance 
quantum information science involves storage manipulation communication information encoded quantum systems phenomena superposition entanglement can provide enhancements possible classically large-scale quantum information processors require stable addressable quantum memories usually form fixed quantum bits qubits means transferring entangling quantum information memories may separated macroscopic even geographic distances atomic systems excellent quantum memories appropriate internal electronic states can coherently store qubits long timescales photons hand natural platform distribution quantum information remote qubits given ability traverse large distances little perturbation recently considerable progress coupling small samples atomic gases photonic channels including entanglement light atoms observation entanglement signatures remotely located atomic ensembles - contrast atomic ensembles single-atom quantum memories allow implementation conditional quantum gates photonic channels2 key requirement quantum computing along lines individual atoms coupled photons cavities- trapped atoms linked emitted photons free space- demonstrate entanglement two fixed single-atom quantum memories separated one metre two remotely located trapped atomic ions emit single photon interference detection photons signals entanglement atomic qubits characterize entangled pair directly measuring qubit correlations near-perfect detection efficiency although entanglement method probabilistic still principle useful subsequent quantum operations scalable quantum information applications-
