mechanosensory pathway drosophila circadian clock
circadian clocks attune physiology virtually living organisms diurnal cycles environments metazoan animals multiple sensory input pathways linked clock synchronization environmental cycle entrainment extrinsic entrainment cues include light temperature show -hour:-hour cycles vibration silence vs sufficient synchronize daily locomotor activity wild-type drosophila melanogaster behavioral synchronization vs cycles required functional clock functional chordotonal organs accompanied phase-shifts daily oscillations period protein concentrations brain clock neurons feedback mechanosensory-and particularly proprioceptive-organs may help animal keep circadian clock sync stimulus-induced activities
