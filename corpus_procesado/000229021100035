friction enhances elasticity granular solids 
years engineers used elastic plastic models describe properties granular solids sand piles grains silos- however theoretical- experimental- results challenge approach specifically claimed- stress granular solids propagates manner described wave-like hyperbolic equations rather elliptic equations static elasticity report numerical simulations response two-dimensional granular slab external load revealing approaches valid albeit different length scales small systems can considered mesoscopic scale grains hyperbolic-like strongly anisotropic response expected however large systems typically considered engineers response closer predicted traditional isotropic elasticity models static friction often ignored simple models plays key role: increases elastic range renders response isotropic even beyond range
