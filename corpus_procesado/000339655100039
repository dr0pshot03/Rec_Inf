merging photoredox nickel catalysis: coupling alpha-carboxyl sp-carbons aryl halides
past years transition metal catalysis enabled bond formation aryl olefinic sp carbons selective predictable manner high functional group tolerance couplings involving alkyl sp carbons proven challenging demonstrate synergistic combination photoredox catalysis nickel catalysis provides alternative cross-coupling paradigm simple readily available organic molecules can systematically used coupling partners using photoredox-metal catalysis approach achieved direct decarboxylative sp-sp cross-coupling amino acids well alpha-o phenyl-substituted carboxylic acids aryl halides moreover mode catalysis can applied direct cross-coupling c-sp3-h dimethylaniline aryl halides via c-h functionalization
