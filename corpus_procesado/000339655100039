merging photoredox nickel catalysis: coupling alpha-carboxyl sp3-carbons aryl halides 
past years transition metal catalysis enabled bond formation aryl olefinic sp2 carbons selective predictable manner high functional group tolerance couplings involving alkyl sp3 carbons proven challenging demonstrate synergistic combination photoredox catalysis nickel catalysis provides alternative cross-coupling paradigm simple readily available organic molecules can systematically used coupling partners using photoredox-metal catalysis approach achieved direct decarboxylative sp3-sp2 cross-coupling amino acids well alpha-o phenyl-substituted carboxylic acids aryl halides moreover mode catalysis can applied direct cross-coupling c-sp3-h dimethylaniline aryl halides via c-h functionalization
