unexpected specialization horizontal disparity primate primary visual cortex
horizontal separation eyes means objects nearer farther fixation point project different locations two retinae differing principally horizontal coordinates horizontal binocular disparity disparity-selective neurons generally studied disparities applied one direction often horizontal determine whether encoding specialized processing disparities along horizontal axis therefore unclear disparity selectivity represents specialization naturally occurring disparities used random dot stereograms study disparity-selective neurons primary visual cortex v1 awake fixating monkeys many combinations vertical horizontal disparity used characterizing surface responses function two-dimensional disparity report response surface usually showed elongation along horizontal disparity axis despite isotropic stimulus thus neurons modulated firing rate wider range horizontal disparity vertical disparity demonstrates disparity-selective cells specialized processing horizontal disparity existing models disparity selectivity require substantial revision
