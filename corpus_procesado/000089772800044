pressure-induced changes compression mechanism aluminous perovskite earths mantle 
although aluminium fifth abundant element earths mantle effect physical properties perovskite main mineral phase lower mantle largely ignored becoming clear however many properties mgsio perovskites remarkably sensitive small amounts aluminium- particular perovskite wt% alo bulk modulus % lower pure magnesian end-member increased compressibility may due high concentrations oxygen vacancies required balance charge aluminium important consequences mantle aluminous perovskites weaker lower seismic velocities hosts water test whether oxygen vacancies exist aluminous perovskites calculated compressibility end-member defect-bearing perovskites using ab initio methods results show perovskites oxygen vacancies significantly greater compressibilities without vacancies results also suggest oxygen vacancies become unfavourable high pressures case physical properties shallow lower mantle affected aluminium-with deeper mantle retaining properties similar aluminium-free perovskite
