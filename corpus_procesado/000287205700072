leishmania rna virus controls severity mucocutaneous leishmaniasis 
mucocutaneous leishmaniasis caused infections intracellular parasites leishmania viannia subgenus including leishmania guyanensis pathology develops parasite dissemination nasopharyngeal tissues destructive metastatic lesions form chronic inflammation currently mechanisms involved lesion development poorly understood show metastasizing parasites high leishmania rna virus- lrv1 burden recognized host toll-like receptor tlr3 induce proinflammatory cytokines chemokines paradoxically tlr3-mediated immune responses rendered mice susceptible infection animals developed increased footpad swelling parasitemia thus lrv1 metastasizing parasites subverted host immune response leishmania promoted parasite persistence
