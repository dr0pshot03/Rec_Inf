hiv adaptation nk-cell-mediated immune pressure 
natural killer nk cells important role control viral infections recognizing virally infected cells variety activating inhibitory receptors- epidemiological functional studies recently suggested nk cells can also contribute control hiv infection recognition virally infected cells activating inhibitory killer immunoglobulin-like receptors kirs- however remains unknown whether nk cells can directly mediate antiviral immune pressure vivo humans describe kir-associated amino-acid polymorphisms hiv sequence chronically infected individuals population level show kir-associated hiv sequence polymorphisms can enhance binding inhibitory kirs hiv--infected cd4+ t cells reduce antiviral activity kir-positive nk cells data demonstrate kir-positive nk cells can place immunological pressure hiv- virus can evade nk-cell-mediated immune pressure selecting sequence polymorphisms previously described virus-specific t cells neutralizing antibodies nk cells might therefore previously underappreciated role contributing viral evolution
