spontaneous organization single cdte nanoparticles luminescent nanowires 
nanoparticles cdte found spontaneously reorganize crystalline nanowires upon controlled removal protective shell organic stabilizer intermediate step nanowire formation found pearl-necklace aggregates strong dipole-dipole interaction believed driving force nanoparticle self-organization linear aggregates subsequently recrystallized nanowires whose diameter determined diameter nanoparticles produced nanowires high aspect ratio uniformity optical activity findings demonstrate collective behavior nanoparticles well convenient simple technique production one-dimensional semiconductor colloids suitable subsequent processing quantum-confined superstructures materials devices
