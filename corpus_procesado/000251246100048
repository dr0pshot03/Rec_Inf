direct observation chaperone-induced changes protein folding pathway
chaperone interactions affect protein folding pathways central problem biology use optical tweezers all-atom molecular dynamics simulations studied effect chaperone secb folding unfolding pathways maltose binding protein mbp single-molecule level absence secb find mbp polypeptide first collapses molten globulelike compacted state folds stable core structure onto several helices finally wrapped interactions secb completely prevent stable tertiary contacts core structure detectable effect folding external helices appears secb binds extended molten globulelike structure retains mbp latter state thus mbp translocation energy required disrupt stable tertiary interactions
