evidence link global lightning activity upper tropospheric water vapour 
tropospheric water vapour key element earths climate direct effects greenhouse gas well indirect effects interaction clouds aerosols tropospheric chemistry small changes upper-tropospheric water vapour much larger impact greenhouse effect small changes water vapour lower atmosphere1 whether impact positive negative feedback remains uncertain2- main challenge addressing question difficulty monitoring upper-tropospheric water vapour globally long timescales show upper-tropospheric water-vapour variability global lightning activity closely linked suggesting upper-tropospheric water-vapour changes can inferred records global lightning activity readily obtained observations single location earths surface correlation reflects fact continental deep-convective thunderstorms transport large amounts water vapour upper troposphere thereby dominate variations global upper-tropospheric water vapour producing lightning earth global lightning induces schumann resonances electromagnetic phenomenon atmosphere can observed easily low cost monitoring resonances might provide convenient method tracking upper-tropospheric water-vapour variability hence contribute better understanding processes affecting climate change
