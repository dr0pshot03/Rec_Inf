fish exploiting vortices decrease muscle activity 
fishes moving turbulent flows formation regularly exposed vortices although animals living fluid environments commonly capture energy vortices experimental data hydrodynamics neural control interactions fish vortices lacking used quantitative flow visualization electromyography show trout will adopt novel mode locomotion slalom experimentally generated vortices activating anterior axial muscles reduced muscle activity vortex exploitation compared activity fishes engaged undulatory swimming suggests decrease cost locomotion provides mechanism understand patterns fish distributions schools riverine environments
