relative metabolic demand inhibition excitation 
using c--deoxyglucose method1 inhibition shown metabolically active process level synapse23 supported recent results magnetic resonance spectroscopy related changes neuroenergetics occurring functional activation neurotransmitter cycling4 however inhibitory synapses less numerous strategically better located excitatory synapses indicating inhibition may efficient therefore less energy-consuming excitation test hypothesis using event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging volunteers whose motor cortex inhibited no-go condition go/no-go task demonstrated transcranial magnetic stimulation unlike excitation inhibition evoked measurable change blood-oxygenation-level-dependent signal motor cortex indicating inhibition less metabolically demanding therefore activation seen functional imaging studies probably results excitation rather inhibition
