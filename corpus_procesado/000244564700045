rethinking organic aerosols: semivolatile emissions photochemical aging 
primary organic-particulate emissions semivolatile; thus partially evaporate atmospheric dilution creating substantial amounts low-volatility gas-phase material laboratory experiments show photo-oxidation diesel emissions rapidly generates organic aerosol greatly exceeding contribution known secondary organic-aerosol precursors attribute unexplained secondary organic-aerosol production oxidation low-volatility gas-phase species accounting partitioning photochemical processing primary emissions creates regionally distributed aerosol brings model predictions better agreement observations controlling organic particulate-matter concentrations will require substantial changes approaches currently used measure regulate emissions
