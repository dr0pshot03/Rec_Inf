basigin receptor essential erythrocyte invasion plasmodium falciparum 
erythrocyte invasion plasmodium falciparum central pathogenesis malaria invasion requires series extracellular recognition events erythrocyte receptors ligands merozoite invasive form parasite none known receptor-ligand interactions involved- required parasite strains indicating parasite able access multiple redundant invasion pathways show identified receptor-ligand pair essential erythrocyte invasion tested p falciparum strains systematically screening library erythrocyte proteins found ok blood group antigen basigin receptor pfrh5 parasite ligand essential blood stage growth erythrocyte invasion potently inhibited soluble basigin basigin knockdown invasion completely blocked using low concentrations anti-basigin antibodies importantly effects observed across laboratory-adapted field strains tested furthermore oka- erythrocytes express basigin variant weaker binding affinity pfrh5 reduced invasion efficiencies discovery cross-strain dependency single extracellular receptor-ligand pair erythrocyte invasion p falciparum provides focus new anti-malarial therapies
