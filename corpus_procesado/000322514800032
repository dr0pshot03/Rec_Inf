reactivating head regrowth regeneration-deficient planarian species
species capable regenerating lost body parts occur throughout animal kingdom yet close relatives often regeneration incompetent face survival fittest animals regenerate others remains fascinating question planarian flatworms well known studied ability regenerate minute tissue pieces yet species limited regeneration abilities described even amongst planarians report characterization regeneration defect planarian dendrocoelum lacteum successful rescue tissue fragments cut posterior half body species unable regenerate head ultimately die find defect originates early stages head specification require inhibition canonical wnt signalling planarian species- notably rna interference rnai-mediated knockdown dlac-beta-catenin- wnt signal transducer restored regeneration fully functional heads tail pieces rescuing d lacteums regeneration defect results demonstrate utility comparative studies towards reactivation regenerative abilities regeneration-deficient animals furthermore availability d lacteum regeneration-impaired planarian model species provides first step towards elucidating evolutionary mechanisms ultimately determine animals regenerate others
