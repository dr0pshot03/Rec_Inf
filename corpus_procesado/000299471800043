multi-isotope imaging mass spectrometry reveals slow protein turnover hair-cell stereocilia 
hair cells inner ear normally replaced animals life must continually renew components various organelles among stereocilia core several hundred actin filaments arise apical surfaces bear mechanotransduction apparatus tips actin turnover stereocilia previously studied transfecting neonatal rat hair cells culture beta-actin-gfp fusion evidence found actin replaced top days overexpression actin-binding protein espin causes elongation stereocilia within hours also suggesting rapid regulation stereocilia lengths similarly mechanosensory tip links replaced hours cleavage chicken mammalian hair cells contrast turnover chick stereocilia vivo much slower might certain components stereocilia turn quickly rapid turnover occurs neonatal animals culture response challenge like breakage actin overexpression quantify protein turnover feeding animals n-labelled precursor amino acid using multi-isotope imaging mass spectrometry measure appearance new protein surprisingly adult frogs mice neonatal mice vivo vitro stereocilia remarkably stable incorporating newly synthesized protein <% per day stereocilia tips rapid turnover treadmilling observed methods confirmed this: hair cells expressing beta-actin-gfp bleached fiducial lines across hair bundles move days stopped expression beta gamma-actin tamoxifen-inducible recombination neither actin isoform left stereocilia except tips thus rapid turnover stereocilia occurs tips treadmilling process
