targeting isoprenylcysteine methylation ameliorates disease mouse model progeria 
several progeroid disorders including hutchinson-gilford progeria syndrome hgps restrictive dermopathy zmpste24 deficiency arise farnesylated methylated form prelamin accumulates nuclear envelope found hypomorphic allele isoprenylcysteine carboxyl methyltransferase icmt increased body weight normalized grip strength prevented bone fractures death zmpste24-deficient mice reduced icmt activity caused prelamin mislocalization within nucleus triggered prelamin a-dependent activation akt-mammalian target rapamycin mtor signaling abolished premature senescence zmpste24-deficient fibroblasts icmt inhibition increased akt-mtor signaling proliferation delayed senescence human hgps fibroblasts reduce levels misshapen nuclei mouse human cells thus targeting icmt might useful treating prelamin a-associated progeroid disorders
