optically controlled locking nuclear field via coherent dark-state spectroscopy
single electron hole spin trapped inside semiconductor quantum dot forms foundation many proposed quantum logic devices- group iii-v materials resonance coherence two ground states single spin inevitably affected lattice nuclear spins hyperfine interaction- dynamics single spin also influence nuclear environment- recent efforts made protect coherence spins quantum dots suppressing nuclear spin fluctuations however coherent control single spin single dot simultaneous suppression nuclear fluctuations yet achieved report suppression nuclear field fluctuations singly charged quantum dot well thermal value shown enhancement single electron spin dephasing time t* measure using coherent dark-state spectroscopy suppression nuclear fluctuations found result hole-spin assisted dynamic nuclear spin polarization feedback process stable value nuclear field determined laser frequencies fixed laser powers nuclear field locking demonstrated three-laser measurement indicating possible enhancement electron spin t* factor several hundred simple powerful method enhancing electron spin coherence time without use spin echo-type techniques expect results will enable reproducible preparation nuclear spin environment repetitive control measurement single spin minimal statistical broadening
