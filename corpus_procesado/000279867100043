transmission topological surface states surface barriers
topological surface states class novel electronic states potential interest quantum computing spintronic applications- unlike conventional two-dimensional electron states surface states expected immune localization overcome barriers caused material imperfection- previous experiments demonstrated topological surface states backscatter equal opposite momentum states owing chiral spin texture- however far evidence states fact transmit naturally occurring surface defects use scanning tunnelling microscope measure transmission reflection probabilities topological surface states antimony naturally occurring crystalline steps separating atomic terraces contrast nontopological surface states common metals copper silver gold- either reflected absorbed atomic steps show topological surface states antimony penetrate barriers high probability demonstration extended nature antimonys topological surface states suggests states may useful high current transmission even presence atomic-scale irregularities-an electronic feature sought efficiently interconnect nanoscale devices
