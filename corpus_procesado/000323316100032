digit loss archosaur evolution interplay selection constraints
evolution involves interplay natural selection developmental constraints- seen example digits lost limbs evolution extant archosaurs crocodiles birds show several instances digit loss different selective regimes show limbs one two three four ancestral number five digits lost digits sometimes persist millions years developmental vestiges- examine digit loss nile crocodile five birds using markers three successive stages digit development two independent lineages different selection wing digit markers disappear contrast hindlimb digit v persists species sampled cartilage sox9-expressing precartilage domains million years adult digit disappeared therefore mismatch evolution embryonic adult phenotypes limbs regardless digit number showed similar expression sonic hedgehog shh even one-fingered emu wing expression posterior genes hoxd11 hoxd12 conserved whereas expression anterior genes gli3 alx4 suggest persistence digit v embryo may reflect constraints particularly conserved posterior gene networks associated zone polarizing activity zpa rapid complete disappearance digit may reflect zpa-independent specification hence weaker developmental constraints interacting constraints selection pressures limb functions flying perching model may help explain diverse patterns digit loss tetrapods study may also help understand selection adults leads changes development
