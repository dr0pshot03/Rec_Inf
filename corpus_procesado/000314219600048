nuclear genome transfer human oocytes eliminates mitochondrial dna variants 
mitochondrial dna mutations transmitted maternally within oocyte cytoplasm often cause life-threatening disorders explore use nuclear genome transfer unfertilized oocytes two donors prevent transmission mitochondrial mutations nuclear genome transfer reduce developmental efficiency blastocyst stage genome integrity maintained provided spontaneous oocyte activation avoided transfer incompletely assembled spindle-chromosome complexes mitochondrial dna transferred nuclear genome initially detected levels % decreasing blastocysts stem-cell lines undetectable levels remained undetectable passaging one year clonal expansion differentiation neurons cardiomyocytes beta-cells cellular reprogramming stem cells differentiated cells mitochondrial respiratory chain enzyme activities oxygen consumption rates indistinguishable controls results demonstrate potential nuclear genome transfer prevent transmission mitochondrial disorders humans
