visualizing 3d internal structure calcite single crystals grown agarose hydrogels 
single crystals usually faceted solids homogeneous chemical compositions biogenic synthetic calcite single crystals however found incorporate macromolecules spurring investigations large molecules distributed within crystals without substantially disrupting crystalline lattice electron tomography reveals random three-dimensional networks agarose nanofibers incorporated single crystals synthetic calcite allowing high low-energy fiber/crystal interface facets satisfy network curvatures results suggest physical entrapment polymer aggregates viable mechanism macromolecules can become incorporated inside inorganic single crystals work implications understanding structure formation biominerals well toward development new high-surface area single-crystal composite materials
