selective oxidation dioxygen gold nanoparticle catalysts derived atom clusters 
supported gold nanoparticles excited much interest owing unusual somewhat unexpected catalytic properties- origin catalytic activity still fully understood experimental work gold particles supported titanium dioxide single crystal surface established striking size threshold effect associated metal insulator transition gold particles catalytically active diameters fall similar nm however remarkable catalytic behaviour might also part arise strong electronic interaction gold titanium dioxide support case industrially important selective oxidation reactions explanation effectiveness gold nanoparticle catalysts complicated need additives drive reaction and/or presence strong support interactions incomplete understanding possible catalytic role- show small gold entities similar nm derived atom gold clusters supported inert materials efficient robust catalysts selective oxidation styrene dioxygen find sharp size threshold catalytic activity particles diameters similar nm completely inactive observations suggest catalytic activity arises altered electronic structure intrinsic small gold nanoparticles use atom gold clusters may prove viable route synthesis robust gold catalysts suited practical application
