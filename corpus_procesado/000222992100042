nanoparticles: strained stiff 
nanoparticles may contain unusual forms structural disorder can substantially modify materials properties thus solely considered small pieces bulk material developed method quantify intermediate-range order -nanometer-diameter zinc sulfide nanoparticles show structural coherence lost distances beyond nanometers zinc-sulfur einstein vibration frequency nanoparticles substantially higher bulk zinc sulfide implying structural stiffening explained observed % radial compression must primarily due inhomogeneous internal strain caused competing relaxations irregular surface methods developed generally applicable characterization nanoscale solids many may exhibit complex disorder strain
