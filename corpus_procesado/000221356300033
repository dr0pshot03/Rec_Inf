formation massive protostar disk accretion gas 
formation low-mass stars like sun can explained gravitational collapse molecular cloud fragment protostellar core subsequent accretion gas dust surrounding interstellar medium- theoretical considerations suggest radiation pressure protostar in-falling material may prevent formation stars ten solar masses mechanism although calculations claimed stars solar masses can principle formed via accretion disk- given uncertainty fact massive stars born dense clusters suggested high-mass stars result runaway merging intermediate-mass stars report observations clearly show massive star born large rotating accretion disk protostar already assembled solar masses accretion process still going gas reservoir circumstellar disk contains least solar masses additional gas providing sufficient fuel substantial growth forming star
