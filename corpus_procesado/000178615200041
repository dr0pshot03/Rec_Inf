cdc6 synthesis regulates replication competence xenopus oocytes
early division cycles embryo rely oocytes ability replicate dna meiosis oocytes temporarily lose ability single round pre-meiotic s-phase oocytes enter meiosis rapidly arrest prophase meiosis g2 upon hormonal stimulation arrested oocytes resume meiosis reestablish dna replication competence meiosis shortly germinal vesicle breakdown gvbd repress replication fertilization oocytes lose regain replication competence meiosis important questions underlying production functional gametes show inability immature xenopus oocytes replicate linked absence cdc6 protein cytoplasmic localization initiation proteins injection cdc6 protein immature oocytes induce dna replication however injection cdc6 oocytes undergoing gvbd sufficient induce dna replication absence protein synthesis results show gvbd cdc6 synthesis events limit establishment oocytes replication competence meiosis
