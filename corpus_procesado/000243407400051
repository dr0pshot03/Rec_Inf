picobiliphytes: marine picoplanktonic algal group unknown affinities eukaryotes 
environmental sequencing revealed unimagined diversity among eukaryotic picoplankton distinct picoplanktonic algal group initially detected 18s ribosomal dna rdna sequences hybridized rrna lambda-targeted rrna-targeted probes detected tyramide signal amplification-fluorescent situ hybridization showed organelle-like body orange fluorescence indicative phycobilins using fluorescence signal cells sorted flow cytometry probed hybridized cells contained -diamidino--phenylindole-stained organelle resembling plastid nucleomorph suggests may secondary endosymbiotic algae pending isolation living cells formal description algae termed picobiliphytes
