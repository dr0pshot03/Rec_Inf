probabilistic functional network yeast genes 
conceptual framework integrating diverse functional genomics data developed reinterpreting experiments provide numerical likelihoods genes functionally linked allows direct comparison integration different classes data resulting probabilistic gene network estimates functional coupling genes within framework reconstructed extensive high-quality functional gene network saccharomyces cerevisiae consisting similar to81% known yeast genes linked similar to34 probabilistic linkages comparable accuracy small-scale interaction assays integrated linkages distinguish true false-positive interactions earlier data sets new interactions emerge genes network contexts shown genes chromatin modification ribosome biogenesis
