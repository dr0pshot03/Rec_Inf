chimeras two isoprenoid synthases catalyze four coupling reactions isoprenoid biosynthesis 
carbon skeletons naturally occurring isoprenoid compounds constructed four fundamental coupling reactions: chain elongation cyclopropanation branching cyclobutanation enzymes catalyze chain elongation cyclopropanation well studied whereas catalyze branching cyclobutanation unknown catalyzed four reactions chimeric proteins generated replacing segments chain-elongation enzyme corresponding sequences cyclopropanation enzyme stereochemical mechanistic considerations suggest four coupling enzymes evolved common ancestor relatively small changes catalytic site
