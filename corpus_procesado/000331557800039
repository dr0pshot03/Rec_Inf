origin spread de novo genes drosophila melanogaster populations
comparative genomic analyses revealed genes may arise ancestrally nongenic sequence however origin spread de novo genes within populations remain obscure identified segregating fixed testis-expressed de novo genes population sample drosophila melanogaster genes appear derive primarily ancestral intergenic unexpressed open reading frames natural selection playing significant role spread results reveal heretofore unappreciated dynamism gene content
