p53 amino-terminal nuclear export signal inhibited dna damage-induced phosphorylation 
p53 protein present low amounts normally growing cells activated response physiological insults mdm2 regulates p53 either inhibiting p53s transactivating function nucleus targeting p53 degradation cytoplasm identified previously unknown nuclear export signal nes amino terminus p53 spanning residues containing two serine residues phosphorylated dna damage required p53 nuclear export colloboration carboxyl-terminal nes serine--phosphorylated p53 induced ultraviolet irradiation exported thus dna damage-induced phosphorylation may achieve optimal p53 activation inhibiting mdm2 binding nuclear export p53
