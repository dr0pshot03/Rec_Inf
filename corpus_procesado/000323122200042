all-optical switch transistor gated one stored photon 
realization all-optical transistor one "gate" photon controls "source" light beam long-standing goal optics stopping light pulse atomic ensemble contained inside optical resonator realized device one stored gate photon controls resonator transmission subsequently applied source photons weak gate pulse induces bimodal transmission distribution corresponding zero one gate photons one stored gate photon produces fivefold source attenuation can retrieved atomic ensemble switching one source photon without retrieval one stored gate photon can switch several hundred source photons improved storage retrieval efficiency work may enable various new applications including photonic quantum gates deterministic multiphoton entanglement
