negative epistasis beneficial mutations evolving bacterial population 
epistatic interactions mutations play prominent role evolutionary theories many studies found epistasis widespread rarely considered beneficial mutations analyzed effects epistasis fitness first five mutations fix experimental population escherichia coli epistasis depended effects combined mutations-the larger expected benefit negative epistatic effect epistasis thus tended produce diminishing returns genotype fitness although interactions involving one particular mutation opposite effect data support models negative epistasis contributes declining rates adaptation time sign epistasis rare genome-wide study contrast prevalence earlier study mutations single gene
