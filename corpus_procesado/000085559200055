rapid evolution reproductive barriers driven sexual conflict 
growing amount experimental data indicates extremely rapid evolution traits proteins related fertilization many diverging taxa- data come studies sperm pollen competition closely related species- molecular studies fertilization proteins- positive selection evolutionary novelty appears acting fertilization systems seems paradoxical successful reproduction requires close matching female male traits suggested- perpetual coevolution sexes can result sexual conflict mating sexual conflict occurs characteristics enhance reproductive success one sex reduce fitness sex numerous examples sexual conflict resulting sensory exploitation polyspermy cost mating discussed detail- potential coevolution due conflict evaluated experimentally develop simple mathematical model describing coevolutionary dynamics male female traits involved reproduction model shows continual change traits constant speed expected whenever females eggs experience fitness loss many compatible males sperms plausibility runaway coevolution increases increasing population size rapid evolution reproductive barriers driven sexual conflict may explain increased speciation rates colonization new habitats adaptive radiation high species richness resource-rich environments
