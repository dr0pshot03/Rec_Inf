interconnected network core-forming melts produced shear deformation
formation mechanism terrestrial planetary cores still poorly understood subject numerous experimental studies- several mechanisms proposed metal-mainly iron nickel-could extracted silicate mantle form core recent models involve gravitational sinking molten metal metal sulphide partially fully molten mantle often referred magma ocean alternative models invoke percolation molten metal along interconnected network porous flow solid silicate matrix experimental studies performed high pressures- shown hydrostatic conditions melts form interconnected network leading widespread assumption formation metallic cores requires magma ocean contrast present experiments demonstrate shear deformation large strains can interconnect significant fraction initially isolated pockets metal metal sulphide melts solid matrix polycrystalline olivine therefore dynamic nonhydrostatic environment percolation remains viable mechanism segregation migration core-forming melts solid silicate mantle
