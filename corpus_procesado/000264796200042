broad diversity neutralizing antibodies isolated memory b cells hiv-infected individuals
antibodies conserved epitopes human immunodeficiency virus hiv surface protein gp140 can protect infection non-human primates infected individuals show high titres broadly neutralizing immunoglobulin igg antibodies serum however little known specificity activity antibodies- characterize memory antibody responses hiv cloned antibodies hiv envelope-binding memory b cells six hiv-infected patients broadly neutralizing antibodies low intermediate viral loads show patients b-cell memory response gp140 composed independent clones expressing high affinity neutralizing antibodies gp120 variable loops cd4-binding site co-receptor-binding site new neutralizing epitope region gp120 cd4-binding site thus igg memory b-cell compartment selected group patients broad serum neutralizing activity hiv comprised multiple clonal responses neutralizing activity directed several epitopes gp120
