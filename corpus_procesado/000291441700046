adaptation evolutionary rescue metapopulations experiencing environmental deterioration
known whether evolution will usually rapid enough allow species adapt persist deteriorating environment tracked eco-evolutionary dynamics metapopulations laboratory model system yeast exposed salt stress metapopulations experienced environmental deterioration three different rates component populations either unconnected connected local dispersal global dispersal found adaptation favored gradual deterioration local dispersal abrupt deterioration frequency evolutionary rescue depended prior rate deterioration rate dispersal adaptation surprisingly frequent rapid small peripheral populations thus evolutionary dynamics affect persistence range species environmental deterioration
