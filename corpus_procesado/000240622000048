calcineurin/nfat signalling regulates pancreatic beta-cell growth function 
growth function organs pancreatic islets adapt meet physiological challenges maintain metabolic balance mechanisms controlling facultative responses unclear diabetes patients treated calcineurin inhibitors cyclosporin indicates calcineurin/nuclear factor activated t-cells nfat signalling might control adaptive islet responses roles pathway beta-cells vivo understood show mice beta-cell-specific deletion calcineurin phosphatase regulatory subunit calcineurin b1 cnb1 develop age-dependent diabetes characterized decreased beta-cell proliferation mass reduced pancreatic insulin content hypoinsulinaemia moreover beta-cells lacking cnb1 reduced expression established regulators beta-cell proliferation conditional expression active nfatc1 cnb1-deficient beta-cells rescues defects prevents diabetes normal adult beta-cells conditional nfat activation promotes expression cell-cycle regulators increases beta-cell proliferation mass resulting hyperinsulinaemia conditional nfat activation also induces expression genes critical beta-cell endocrine function including six genes mutated hereditary forms monogenic type diabetes thus calcineurin/ nfat signalling regulates multiple factors control growth hallmark beta-cell functions revealing unique models pathogenesis therapy diabetes
