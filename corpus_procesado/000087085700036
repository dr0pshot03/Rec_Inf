oceanic cd/p ratio nutrient utilization glacial southern ocean 
glacial periods low atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration associated increased oceanic carbon uptake particularly southern oceans mechanism involved remains unclear ocean productivity strongly influenced nutrient levels palaeo-oceanographic proxies applied investigate nutrient utilization surface water across glacial transitions show present-day cadmium phosphorus concentrations global oceans can explained chemical fractionation particle formation whereby uptake cadmium occurs preference uptake phosphorus allows reconstruction past surface water phosphate concentrations cadmium/calcium ratio planktonic foraminifera results last glacial maximum show similar phosphate utilization subantarctic today much smaller utilization polar southern ocean model consistent expansion glacial sea ice can reconcile proxy records polar nutrient utilization restricting communication ocean atmosphere sea ice expansion also provides mechanism reduced co2 release southern ocean lower glacial atmospheric co2
