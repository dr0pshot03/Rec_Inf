climate sensitivity estimated temperature reconstructions last glacial maximum 
assessing impact future anthropogenic carbon emissions currently impeded uncertainties knowledge equilibrium climate sensitivity atmospheric carbon dioxide doubling previous studies suggest kelvin k best estimate k % probability range nonzero probabilities much higher values latter implying small chance high-impact climate changes difficult avoid combining extensive sea land surface temperature reconstructions last glacial maximum climate model simulations estimate lower median k reduced uncertainty k % probability range can widened using alternate assumptions data subsets assuming paleoclimatic constraints apply future predicted model results imply lower probability imminent extreme climatic change previously thought
