lunar tungsten isotopic evidence late veneer 
according widely accepted theory lunar origin giant impact earth led formation moon also initiated final stage formation earths core1 core formation removed highly siderophile elements hse earths primitive mantle bulk silicate earth yet hse abundances higher expected2 one explanation overabundance late veneer primitive material added bulk silicate earth core formed2 test hypothesis tungsten isotopes useful two reasons: first late veneer material different w-/w- ratio bulk silicate earth second proportionally material added earth moon3 thus late veneer occur bulk silicate earth moon must different w-/w- ratios moreover moon-forming impact also created w- differences mantle core material impactor distinct w-/w- mixed proto-earth giant impact however w-/w- moon determined precisely enough identify signatures late veneer giant impact using more-precise measurement techniques show moon exhibits w- excess +/ parts per million present-day bulk silicate earth excess consistent expected w- difference resulting late veneer total mass composition inferred hse systematics2 thus data independently show hse abundances bulk silicate earth established giant impact core formation predicted late veneer hypothesis unexpectedly find late veneer w- anomaly existed bulk silicate earth moon even though one arisen giant impact origin homogeneous w- pre-late-veneer bulk silicate earth moon enigmatic constitutes challenge current models lunar origin
