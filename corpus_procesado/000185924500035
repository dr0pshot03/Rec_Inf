speed information fast-light optical medium 
one consequence special theory relativity signal can cause effect outside source light cone space-time surface light rays emanate source1 violation principle relativistic causality leads paradoxes effect preceding cause2 recent experiments optical pulse propagation so-called fastlight media-which characterized wave group velocity vg exceeding vacuum speed light c taking negative values-have led renewed debate definition information velocity vi one view vi vg ref violate causality another vi c situations preserve causality find time detect information propagating fast-light medium slightly longer time required detect information travelling vacuum even though vg medium vastly exceeds c observations therefore consistent relativistic causality help resolve controversies surrounding superluminal pulse propagation
