intraspecific polymorphism interspecific divergence: genetics pigmentation drosophila
genetic changes contributing phenotypic differences within species identified handful traits relationship alleles underlying intraspecific polymorphism interspecific divergence largely unknown found noncoding changes tan gene well changes linked ebony gene contribute pigmentation divergence closely related drosophila species moreover found alleles linked tan ebony fixed one drosophila species also contribute variation within another species multiple genotypes underlie similar phenotypes even within population alleles appear predate speciation suggests standing genetic variation present common ancestor gave rise intraspecific polymorphism interspecific divergence
