limits counting: numerical cognition evolution culture 
number words principle allow kinds objects counted ad infinitum one basic requirement complex numerical cognition accordingly short object specific counting sequences language often regarded earlier steps evolution premathematical conceptions greater abstraction present instances melanesia polynesia whose short object specific sequences originated extensive abstract sequence furthermore object specific sequences can shown cognitively advantageous calculations without notation use larger counting units thereby abbreviating higher numbers enhancing counting process extending limits counting results expand knowledge regarding numerical cognition regarding evolution numeration systems
