transcranial magnetic stimulation elicits coupled neural hemodynamic consequences
transcranial magnetic stimulation tms increasingly common technique used selectively modify neural processing however application tms limited uncertainty concerning physiological effects applied tms cat visual cortex evaluated neural hemodynamic consequences short tms pulse trains elicited initial activation similar minute prolonged suppression minutes neural responses furthermore tms disrupted temporal structure activity altering phase relationships neural signals despite complexity response neural changes faithfully reflected hemodynamic signals quantitative coupling present range stimulation parameters results demonstrate long-lasting neural responses tms support use hemodynamic-based neuroimaging effectively monitor changes time
