frequent chromosomal translocations induced dna double-strand breaks
faithful repair dna damage chromosomal double-strand breaks dsbs crucial genomic integrity aberrant repair lesions can result chromosomal rearrangements including translocations associated numerous tumours models predict translocations arise dsb-induced recombination differentiating lymphoid cell types- aberrant repair dna damage induced irradiation agents- however genetic system study aetiology events lacking use mouse embryonic stem cell system examine role dna damage formation translocations rnd two dsbs different chromosomes sufficient promote frequent reciprocal translocations results striking contrast interchromosomal repair single dsb analogous system translocations recovered thus interchromosomal dna repair result genome instability per se presence two dsbs single cell can alter spectrum repair products recovered
