hcf- cleaved active site o-glcnac transferase 
host cell factor- hcf- transcriptional co-regulator human cell-cycle progression undergoes proteolytic maturation six repeated sequences cleaved nutrient-responsive glycosyltransferase o-linked n-acetylglucosamine o-glcnac transferase ogt report tetratricopeptide-repeat domain o-glcnac transferase binds carboxyl-terminal portion hcf- proteolytic repeat cleavage region lies glycosyltransferase active site uridine diphosphate-glcnac conformation similar glycosylation-competent peptide substrate cleavage occurs cysteine glutamate residues results pyroglutamate product conversion cleavage site glutamate serine converts hcf- proteolytic repeat glycosylation substrate thus protein glycosylation hcf- cleavage occur active site
