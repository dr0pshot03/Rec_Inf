contrast tuning auditory cortex 
acoustic features useful converting auditory information perceived objects poorly understood although auditory cortex neurons described narrowly tuned preferentially responsive narrowband signals naturally occurring sounds generally wideband unique spectral energy profiles use parametric wideband acoustic stimuli found neurons awake marmoset monkeys respond vigorously wideband sounds complex spectral shapes preferring stimuli either high low spectral contrast low contrast-preferring neurons studied thoroughly narrowband stimuli previously described findings indicate spectral contrast reflects important stimulus decomposition auditory cortex may contribute recognition acoustic objects
