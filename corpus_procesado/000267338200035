white phosphorus air-stable within self-assembled tetrahedral capsule
air-sensitive nature white phosphorus underlies destructive effect munition: tetrahedral p molecules readily react atmospheric dioxygen leading form element spontaneously combust upon exposure air show hydrophobic p molecules rendered air-stable water-soluble within hydrophobic hollows self-assembled tetrahedral container molecules form water simple organic subcomponents ironii ions stabilization achieved hermetic exclusion o rather constriction individual p molecules addition oxygen atoms p result formation oxidized species large containers phosphorus can released controlled fashion without disrupting cage adding competing guest benzene
