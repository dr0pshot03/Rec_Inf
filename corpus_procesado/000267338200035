white phosphorus air-stable within self-assembled tetrahedral capsule 
air-sensitive nature white phosphorus underlies destructive effect munition: tetrahedral p4 molecules readily react atmospheric dioxygen leading form element spontaneously combust upon exposure air show hydrophobic p4 molecules rendered air-stable water-soluble within hydrophobic hollows self-assembled tetrahedral container molecules form water simple organic subcomponents ironii ions stabilization achieved hermetic exclusion o2 rather constriction individual p4 molecules; addition oxygen atoms p4 result formation oxidized species large containers phosphorus can released controlled fashion without disrupting cage adding competing guest benzene
