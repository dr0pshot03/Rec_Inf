single peptide-mhc complex positively selects diverse specific cd8 t cell repertoire
pathogen recognition t cells dependent exquisite specificity self-major histocompatibility complex mhc molecules presenting bound peptide although specificity results positive negative selection developing t cells thymus relative contribution two processes remains controversial address relation selecting peptide-mhc complex specificity mature t cells generated transgenic mice express single peptide-mhc class complex demonstrate positive selection cd8 t cells mice results mhc-specific repertoire although selection single complex peptide promiscuous mature t cells highly peptide specific thus positive selection imparts mhc peptide specificity peripheral cd8 t cell repertoire
