new high-pressure phases lithium 
lithium considered simple metal ordinary conditions pressure temperature motion conduction electrons weakly perturbed interactions cubic lattice atomic cores recently predicted1 pressures gpa dense li may undergo several structural transitions possibly leading paired-atom phase low symmetry near-insulating properties report synchrotron x-ray diffraction measurements confirm li undergoes pronounced structural changes pressure near gpa element transforms high-pressure face-centred-cubic phase intermediate rhombohedral modification cubic polymorph atoms per unit cell cubic phase observed previously element; unusually calculated electronic density states exhibits pronounced semimetal-like minimum near fermi energy present total-energy calculations provide theoretical support observed phase transition sequence calculations indicate large stability range -atom cubic phase relative various crystal structures tested
