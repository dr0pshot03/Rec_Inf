extended hard-x-ray emission inner parsecs galaxy 
galactic centre hosts puzzling stellar population inner parsecs high abundance surprisingly young relatively massive stars bound within deep potential well central supermassive black hole sagittarius a* ref previous studies suggest population objects emitting soft x-rays less kiloelectronvolts within surrounding hundreds parsecs well population responsible unresolved x-ray emission extending along galactic plane dominated accreting white dwarf systems observations diffuse hardx-ray kiloelectronvolts emission inner parsecs however hampered limited spatial resolution previous instruments report presence distinct hard-x-ray component within central x parsecs revealed subarcminute-resolution images - kiloelectronvolt range emission sharply peaked towards galactic centre surface brightness soft-x-ray population indicate significantly massive population accreting white dwarfs large populations lowmass x-ray binaries millisecond pulsars particle outflows interacting surrounding radiation field dense molecular material magnetic fields however interpretations pose significant challenges understanding stellar evolution binary formation cosmic-ray production galactic centre
