mixing superconductivity antiferromagnetism high-temperature superconductor
still universally accepted theory high-temperature superconductivity models assume doping creates holes valence band insulating antiferromagnetic parent compound antiferromagnetism high-temperature superconductivity intimately related- respective energies nearly equal strong antiferromagnetic fluctuations temporally spatially restricted antiferromagnetic domains expected superconductive phase superconducting fluctuations expected antiferromagnetic phase two states mix extended length scale report one-unit-cell-thick antiferromagnetic la2cuo4 barrier layers remain highly insulating completely block supercurrent characteristic decay length angstrom indicating two phases mix likewise found isolated one-unit-cell-thick layers la185sr015cuo4 remain superconducting latter implies doping new electronic states created near middle bandgap two findings conflict proposed models notable exceptions include postulated spin-charge separation
