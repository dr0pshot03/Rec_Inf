temporal targeting tumour cells neovasculature nanoscale delivery system
continuing search effective treatments cancer emerging model combination traditional chemotherapy anti-angiogenesis agents inhibit blood vessel growth however implementation strategy faced two major obstacles first long-term shutdown tumour blood vessels anti-angiogenesis agent can prevent tumour receiving therapeutic concentration chemotherapy agent second inhibiting blood supply drives intra-tumoural accumulation hypoxia-inducible factor alpha hif1-alpha overexpression hif1-alpha correlated increased tumour invasiveness resistance chemotherapy- report disease-driven engineering drug delivery system nanocell overcomes barriers unique solid tumours nanocell comprises nuclear nanoparticle within extranuclear pegylated-lipid envelope preferentially taken tumour nanocell enables temporal release two drugs: outer envelope first releases anti-angiogenesis agent causing vascular shutdown inner nanoparticle trapped inside tumour releases chemotherapy agent focal release within tumour results improved therapeutic index reduced toxicity technology can extended additional agents target multiple signalling pathways distinct tumour compartments enabling model integrative approach cancer therapy
