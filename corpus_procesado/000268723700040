genetic architecture maize flowering time
flowering time complex trait controls adaptation plants local environment outcrossing species zea mays maize dissected variation flowering time set recombinant inbred lines maize nested association mapping population nam nearly million plants assayed eight environments showed evidence single large-effect quantitative trait loci qtls instead identified evidence numerous small-effect qtls shared among families however allelic effects differ across founder lines identified individual qtls allelic effects determined geographic origin large effects epistasis environmental interactions thus simple additive model accurately predicts flowering time maize contrast genetic architecture observed selfing plant species rice arabidopsis
