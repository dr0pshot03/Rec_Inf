chromatic adaptation photosynthetic membranes
many biological membranes adapt response environmental conditions investigated composition architecture photosynthetic membranes bacterium change response light using atomic force microscopy despite large modifications membrane composition local environment core complexes remained unaltered whereas specialized paracrystalline light-harvesting antenna domains grew tow-light conditions thus protein mixture membrane shows eutectic behavior can mimicked simple model structural adaptation ensures efficient photon capture low-light conditions prevents photodamage high-light conditions
