measurement polarization degree angular scale interferometer
measurements cosmic microwave background cmb radiation can reveal remarkable precision conditions universe years old three fundamental properties cmb frequency spectrum determines temperature fluctuations temperature polarization across range angular scales frequency spectrum well determined considerable progress made measuring power spectrum temperature fluctuations despite many efforts measure polarization detection property cmb hitherto beyond reach even sensitive observations describe degree angular scale interferometer dasi array radio telescopes past two years conducted polarization-sensitive observations cmb amundsen-scott south pole research station
