cell-of-origin chromatin organization shapes mutational landscape cancer 
cancer disease potentiated mutations somatic cells cancer mutations distributed uniformly along human genome instead different human genomic regions vary fivefold local density cancer somatic mutations posing fundamental problem statistical methods used cancer genomics epigenomic organization proposed major determinant cancer mutational landscape- however somatic mutagenesis epigenomic features highly cell-type-specific- investigated distribution mutations multiple independent samples diverse cancer types compared cell-type-specific epigenomic features show chromatin accessibility modification together replication timing explain % variance mutation rates along cancer genomes best predictors local somatic mutation density epigenomic features derived likely cell type origin corresponding malignancy moreover find cell-of-origin chromatin features much stronger determinants cancer mutation profiles chromatin features matched cancer cell lines furthermore show cell type origin cancer can accurately determined based distribution mutations along genome thus dna sequence cancer genome encompasses wealth information identity epigenomic features cell origin
