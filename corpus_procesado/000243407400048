secondary sirnas result unprimed rna synthesis form distinct class
caenorhabditis elegans effective rna interference rnai response requires production secondary short interfering rnas sirnas rna-directed rna polymerases rdrps cloned secondary sirnas transgenic c elegans lines expressing single nucleotide primary sirna several secondary sirnas start nucleotides downstream primary sirna indicating non-risc rna-induced silencing complex-cleaved mrnas substrates secondary sirna production lines expressing primary sirnas single-nucleotide mismatches secondary sirnas carry mismatch contain nucleotide complementary mrna infer rdrps perform unprimed rna synthesis secondary sirnas antisense polarity carry di triphosphates minority associated rde- rnai-specific argonaute protein therefore secondary sirnas represent distinct class small rnas biogenesis depends rdrps propose secondary sirna individual rdrp product
