theory predicts uneven distribution genetic diversity within species 
global efforts conserve species strongly influenced heterogeneous distribution species diversity across earth manifest conservation efforts focused diversity hotspots- conservation genetic diversity within individual species important factor survival face environmental changes disease show diversity within species also distributed unevenly using simple genealogical models show genetic distinctiveness scale-free power law distribution property implies disproportionate fraction diversity concentrated small sub-populations even population well-mixed small groups importance overall population diversity even without extrinsic perturbations large fluctuations diversity owing extinctions small groups also show diversity can geographically non-uniform potentially including sharp boundaries distantly related organisms without extrinsic causes barriers gene flow past migration events obtained results studying fundamental scaling properties genealogical trees theoretical results agree field data global samples pseudomonas bacteria contrary previous studies results imply diversity loss owing severe extinction events high focusing conservation efforts highly distinctive groups can save much diversity
