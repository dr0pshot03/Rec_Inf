impact jetting origin chondrules 
chondrules millimetre-scale previously molten spherules found meteorites chondrules formed large differentiating planetesimals already accreted volatile-rich olivine reveals chondrules formed inextremely solid-rich environments like impact plumes solar nebula- unique chondrules cb chondrites probably formed vapour-melt plume produced hypervelocity impact impact velocity greater kilometres per second acceptable formation model overwhelming majority chondrules however established report impacts can produce enough chondrules first five million years planetary accretion explain observed abundance building previous study impact jetting simulate protoplanetary impacts finding material melted ejected high speed impact velocity exceeds kilometres per second using monte carlo accretion code estimate location timing sizes velocities chondrule-formingimpacts ejecta size estimates indicate jetted melt will form millimetre-scale droplets radiative transfermodels show droplets experience expected cooling rates ten thousand kelvin per hour impact origin chondrules implies meteorites byproduct planet formation rather leftover building material
