heme-like coordination chemistry within nanoporous molecular crystals 
crystal engineering nanoporous structures yet exploited heme motif widely found proteins report derivative iron phthalocyanine close analog heme forms millimeter-scale molecular crystals contain large interconnected voids cubic nanometers defined cubic assembly six phthalocyanines rapid ligand exchange achieved within phthalocyanine nanoporous crystals single-crystal-to-single-crystal scsc transformations differentiation binding sites similar occurs hemoproteins achieved monodentate ligands add preferentially axial binding site within cubic assembly whereas bidentate ligands selectively bind opposite axial site link cubic assemblies bidentate ligands act molecular wall ties prevent collapse molecular crystal removal solvent resulting crystals possess high surface areas square meters per gram bind n- equivalent heme distal site scsc process characterized x-ray crystallography
