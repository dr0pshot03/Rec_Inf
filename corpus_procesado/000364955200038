stable recombination hotspots birds
dna-binding protein prdm9 critical role specifying meiotic recombination hotspots mice apes appears absent vertebrate species including birds study evolution determinants recombination species lacking gene encodes prdm9 inferred fine-scale genetic maps population resequencing data two bird species: zebra finch taeniopygia guttata long-tailed finch poephila acuticauda found species recombination hotspots enriched near functional genomic elements unlike mice apes hotspots shared two species conservation seems extend tens millions years observations suggest absence prdm9 recombination targets functional features enable access genome constrain evolution
