effects cis arrangement chromatin insulators enhancer-blocking activity 
chromatin boundary elements insulators believed regulate gene activity complex genetic loci organizing specialized chromatin structures report enhancer-blocking activity drosophila suhw insulator sensitive insulator copy number position two tandem copies suhw ineffective blocking various enhancers downstream promoter moreover enhancer blocked effectively promoter two flanking suhw insulators single intervening one thus insulators may modulate enhancer-promoter interactions interacting facilitating formation chromatin loop domains
