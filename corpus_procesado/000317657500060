representation three-dimensional space hippocampus flying bats 
many animals air water land navigate three-dimensional 3d environments yet remains unclear brain circuits encode animals 3d position recorded single neurons freely flying bats using wireless neural-telemetry system studied hippocampal place cells encode 3d volumetric space flight individual place cells active confined 3d volumes >% neurons three axes encoded similar resolution 3d place fields different neurons spanned different locations collectively represented uniformly available space room theta rhythmicity absent firing patterns 3d place cells results suggest bat hippocampus represents 3d volumetric space uniform nearly isotropic rate code
