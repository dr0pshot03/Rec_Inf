metabolite-enabled eradication bacterial persisters aminoglycosides
bacterial persistence state sub-population dormant cells persisters tolerates antibiotic treatment- bacterial persisters implicated biofilms chronic recurrent infections- despite clinical relevance currently viable means eradicating persisters show specific metabolic stimuli enable killing gram-negative escherichia coli gram-positive staphylococcus aureus persisters aminoglycosides potentiation aminoglycoside-specific rely growth resumption effective aerobic anaerobic conditions proceeds generation proton-motive force facilitates aminoglycoside uptake results demonstrate persisters although dormant primed metabolite uptake central metabolism respiration show aminoglycosides can used combination specific metabolites treat e coli s aureus biofilms furthermore demonstrate approach can improve treatment chronic infections mouse urinary tract infection model work establishes strategy eradicating bacterial persisters based metabolism highlights importance metabolic environment antibiotic treatment
