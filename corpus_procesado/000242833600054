photoconductive coaxial nanotubes molecularly connected electron donor acceptor layers
controlled self-assembly trinitrofluorenone-appended gemini-shaped amphiphilic hexabenzocoronene selectively formed nanotubes microfibers different photochemical properties nanotubes nanometers diameter several micrometers long molecular layer electron-accepting trinitrofluorenone laminates electron-donating graphitic layer pi-stacked hexabenzocoronene coaxial nanotubular structure allows photochemical generation spatially separated charge carriers quick photoconductive response large on/off ratio greater sharp contrast microfibers consist charge-transfer complex hexabenzocoronene trinitrofluorenone parts exhibit almost photocurrent generation
