s-rnase uptake compatible pollen tubes gametophytic self-incompatibility 
many flowering plants avoid inbreeding genetic mechanism termed self-incompatibility extremely polymorphic s-locus1 controls gametophytic self-incompatibility system causes pollen rejection active arrest pollen tube growth inside style s-allele carried haploid pollen matches one s-alleles present diploid style known product s-locus s-rnase expressed mature style2 pollen component cell-cell recognition system unknown current models34 propose either acts gatekeeper allowing cognate s-rnase enter pollen tube inhibitor non-cognate s-rnases latter case s-rnases presumed enter pollen tubes; thus two models make diametrically opposed predictions concerning entry s-rnases compatible pollen use immunocytochemical labelling pollen tubes growing styles show accumulation s-rnase cytoplasm pollen-tube haplotypes thus providing experimental support inhibitor model
