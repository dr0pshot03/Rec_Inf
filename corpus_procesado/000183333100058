programmed dna deletion rna-guided system genome defense
genomewide dna rearrangements occur many eukaryotes development functions mechanisms poorly understood previous studies implicated sequence-recognition mechanism based rna-mediated interactions nuclei ciliated protozoa study found process recognized deleted foreign gene integrated tetrahymena chromosome suggesting unusual mechanism genome surveillance found injection double-stranded rna cell specific developmental stages triggers efficient deletion targeted genomic regions together results indicate rna-based mechanism directs genomewide dna rearrangements serves disable invading genetic agents
