flow mantle fluids ductile lower crust: helium isotope trends 
heat mass injected shallow crust mantle fluids able flow ductile lower crust minimum he-/he- ratios surface fluids northern basin range province western north america increase systematically low crustal values east high mantle values west regional trend correlates rates active crustal deformation highest ratios occur extension shear strain rates greatest correspondence helium isotope ratios active transtensional deformation indicates deformation-enhanced permeability mantle fluids can penetrate ductile lithosphere even regions substantial magmatism superimposed regional trend local high he-/he- anomalies indicating hidden magmatic activity and/or deep fluid production locally enhanced permeability identifying zones high resource potential particularly geothermal energy development
