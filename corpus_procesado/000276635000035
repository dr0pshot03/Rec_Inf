catastrophic cascade failures interdependent networks 
complex networks studied intensively decade research still focuses limited case single non-interacting network- modern systems coupled together- therefore modelled interdependent networks fundamental property interdependent networks failure nodes one network may lead failure dependent nodes networks may happen recursively can lead cascade failures fact failure small fraction nodes one network may lead complete fragmentation system several interdependent networks dramatic real-world example cascade failures concurrent malfunction electrical blackout affected much italy september : shutdown power stations directly led failure nodes internet communication network turn caused breakdown power stations develop framework understanding robustness interacting networks subject cascading failures present exact analytical solutions critical fraction nodes removal will lead failure cascade complete fragmentation two interdependent networks surprisingly broader degree distribution increases vulnerability interdependent networks random failure opposite single network behaves findings highlight need consider interdependent network properties designing robust networks
