predictive behavior within microbial genetic networks 
homeostatic framework dominated understanding cellular physiology question whether homeostasis alone adequately explains microbial responses environmental stimuli explore capacity intracellular networks predictive behavior fashion similar metazoan nervous systems show silico biochemical networks evolving randomly precisely defined complex habitats capture dynamical multidimensional structure diverse environments forming internal representations allow prediction environmental change provide evidence anticipatory behavior revealing striking correlations escherichia coli transcriptional responses temperature oxygen perturbations precisely mirroring covariation parameters upon transitions outside world mammalian gastrointestinal tract show internal correlations reflect true associative learning paradigm show rapid decoupling upon exposure novel environments
