vega rapidly rotating star 
vega second brightest star northern hemisphere serves primary spectral type standard although spectrum dominated broad hydrogen lines narrower lines heavy elements suggested slow moderate rotation giving confidence ground-based calibration visible spectrum safely extrapolated ultraviolet near-infrared atmosphere models also serves primary photometric calibrator problems: star bright compared peers unusually shaped absorption line profiles leading suggest distorted rapidly rotating star seen pole-on report optical interferometric observations show vega asymmetric brightness distribution bright slightly offset polar axis star rotating per cent breakup speed addition explaining unusual brightness line shape peculiarities result leads prediction excess near-infrared emission compared visible agreement observations large temperature differences predicted across surface call question composition determinations adding uncertainty vegas age opening possibility debris disk substantially older previously thought
