molecular architecture axonemes revealed cryoelectron tomography
eukaryotic flagella cilia built + array microtubules plus accessory proteins forming biological machine called axoneme describe three-dimensional structure rapidly frozen axonemes chlamydomonas sea urchin sperm using cryoelectron tomography image processing focus motor enzyme dynein images suggest model way dynein generates force slide microtubules also reveal two dynein linkers may provide hard-wiring coordinate motor enzyme action circumferentially along axoneme periodic densities also observed inside doublet microtubules may contribute doublet stability
