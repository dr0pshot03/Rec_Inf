sequencing human exomes reveals adaptation high altitude 
residents tibetan plateau show heritable adaptations extreme altitude sequenced exomes ethnic tibetans encompassing coding sequences % human genes average coverage 18x per individual genes showing population-specific allele frequency changes represent strong candidates altitude adaptation identified strongest signal natural selection came endothelial per-arnt-sim pas domain protein epas1 transcription factor involved response hypoxia one single-nucleotide polymorphism snp epas1 shows % frequency difference tibetan han samples representing fastest allele frequency change observed human gene date snps association erythrocyte abundance supports role epas1 adaptation hypoxia thus population genomic survey revealed functionally important locus genetic adaptation high altitude
