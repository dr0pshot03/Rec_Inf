epigenetic temporal control mouse hox genes vivo 
vertebrate development temporal control hox gene transcriptional activation follows genomic order genes within hox clusters although recognized "hox clock" serves coordinate body patterning underlying mechanism remains elusive shown successive hox gene activation mouse embryo closely associated directional transition chromatin status judged dynamic progression transcription-competent modifications: increases activation marks correspond decreases repressive marks furthermore using mouse hox cluster split two pieces document necessity maintain clustered organization properly implement process results suggest chromatin modifications important parameters temporal regulation gene family
