diurnal cycle water ice comet 67p/churyumov-gerasimenko 
observations cometary nuclei revealed limited amount surface water ice- insufficient explain observed water outgassing clearly demonstrated comet 9p/tempel dust jets driven volatiles partially correlated exposed ice regions observations 67p/churyumov-gerasimenko revealed activity diurnal variation intensity arising changing insolation conditions previously concluded water vapour generated ice-rich subsurface layers transport mechanism linked solar illumination- hitherto observed periodic condensations water vapour close surface suggested explain short-lived outbursts seen near sunrise comet 9p/tempel report observations water ice surface comet 67p/churyumovgerasimenko appearing disappearing cyclic pattern follows local illumination conditions providing source localized activity water cycle appears important process evolution comet leading cyclical modification relative abundance water ice surface
