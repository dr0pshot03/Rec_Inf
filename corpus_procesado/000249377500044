saturns gravitational field internal rotation interior structure 
saturns internal rotation period unknown though must less hours minutes seconds derived magnetic field plus kilometric radiation data using cassini spacecrafts gravitational data along pioneer voyager radio occultation wind data obtain rotation period hours minutes +/ seconds rapid spin implies slower equatorial wind speeds saturn previously assumed winds higher latitudes flow east west jupiter related saturn interior model molecular-to-metallic hydrogen transition halfway planets center
