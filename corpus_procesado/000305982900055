direct highly regioselective enantioselective allylation beta-diketones
enantioselective allylation ketones problem fundamental importance asymmetric reaction design especially given small number methods can generate tertiary carbinols despite vast amount attention synthetic chemists given problem- success generally limited just simple ketone types method selective allylation functionally complex ketones greatly increase utility ketone allylation methods chemical synthesis important targets describe operationally simple direct regioselective enantioselective allylation beta-diketones strong tendency beta-diketones act nucleophilic species overcome using enol form provide necessary bronsted-acid activation reaction significantly expands pool enantiomerically enriched functionally complex tertiary carbinols may easily accessed also overturns century received wisdom regarding reactivity beta-diketones
