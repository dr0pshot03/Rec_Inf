visualizing signals moving cells 
cells display highly complex spatiotemporal organization required exert wide variety different functions example detection processing propagation nerve impulses neurons; contraction relaxation muscle cells; movement leukocytes; adsorption secretion nutrients metabolites epithelial cells lining gut successful execution complex processes requires highly dynamic information transfer different regions compartments within cells development fluorescent sensors intracellular signaling molecules coupled improved microscopic imaging techniques now become possible investigate signal propagation cells high spatial temporal resolution
