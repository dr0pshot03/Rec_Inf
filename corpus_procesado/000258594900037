targeting qsec signaling virulence antibiotic development
many bacterial pathogens rely conserved membrane histidine sensor kinase qsec respond host adrenergic signaling molecules bacterial signals order promote expression virulence factors using high throughput screen identified small molecule led209 inhibits binding signals qsec preventing autophosphorylation consequently inhibiting qsec mediated activation virulence gene expression led209 toxic inhibit pathogen growth however compound markedly inhibits virulence several pathogens vitro vivo animals inhibition signaling offers strategy development broad spectrum antimicrobial drugs
