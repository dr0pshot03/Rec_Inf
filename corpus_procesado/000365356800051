six-dimensional real reciprocal space small-angle x-ray scattering tomography 
used combination raster scanning small-angle x-ray scattering saxs proven valuable imaging technique nanoscale1 example bone teeth brain matter2- although two-dimensional projection imaging used characterize various materials successfully three-dimensional extension saxs computed tomography poses substantial challenges yet overcome previous work6- using saxs computed tomography unable preserve oriented saxs signals reconstruction present solution problem obtain complete saxs computed tomography preserves oriented scattering information introducing virtual tomography axes take advantage two-dimensional saxs information recorded area detector use reconstruct full three-dimensional scattering distribution reciprocal space voxel three-dimensional object real space presented method interest combined six-dimensional real reciprocal space characterization mesoscopic materials hierarchically structured features length scales ranging nanometres millimetres-for example biomaterials bone teeth functional materials fuel-cell battery components
