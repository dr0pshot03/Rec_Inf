magnetic-field-controlled reconfigurable semiconductor logic 
logic devices based magnetism show promise increasing computational efficiency decreasing consumed power offer zero quiescent power yet combine novel functions programmable logic operation non-volatile built-in memory1- however practical efforts adapt magnetic device logic suffer low signal-to-noise ratio performance attributes adequate logic gates rather exploiting magnetoresistive effects result spin-dependent transport carriers approached development magnetic logic device different way: use phenomenon large magnetoresistance found non-magnetic semiconductors high electric fields67 report device showing strong diode characteristic highly sensitive sign magnitude external magnetic field offering reversible change two different characteristic states application magnetic field feature results magnetic control carrier generation8 recombination insb p-n bilayer channel9 simple circuits combining elementary devices fabricated tested boolean logic functions including nand performed programmed dynamically external electric magnetic signals demonstrating magnetic-field-controlled semiconductor reconfigurable logic room temperature magnetic technology permits new kind spintronic device characterized current switch rather voltage switch provides simple compact platform non-volatile reconfigurable logic devices
