induction dna methylation gene silencing short interfering rnas human cells retracted article see vol pg 
double-stranded rnas dsrnas induce post-transcriptional gene silencing several species animal plant1- plants dsrnas targeted cpg islands within promoter can also induce rna-directed dna methylation3-; however remains unclear whether gene silencing mediated dna methylation can induced dsrnas mammalian cells demonstrate short interfering rnas sirnas; --nucleotide rna molecules induce dna methylation histone h3 methylation human cells synthetic sirnas targeted cpg islands e-cadherin promoter induced significant dna methylation histone h3 lysine methylation mcf- normal mammary epithelial cells result sirnas repressed expression e-cadherin gene transcriptional level addition disrupting expression either one two dna methyltransferases dnmt1 dnmt3b specific sirnas abolished sirna-mediated methylation dna moreover vector-based sirnas targeted erbb2 also known her2 promoter also induced dna methylation mcf- cells thus sirnas targeted cpg islands within promoter specific gene can induce transcriptional gene silencing means dna-methyltransferase-dependent methylation dna human cells might potential new type gene therapeutic agent
