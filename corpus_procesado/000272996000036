complex landscapes somatic rearrangement human breast cancer genomes 
multiple somatic rearrangements often found cancer genomes however underlying processes rearrangement contribution cancer development poorly characterized use paired-end sequencing strategy identify somatic rearrangements breast cancer genomes rearrangements breast cancers previously appreciated rearrangements frequent gene footprints intrachromosomal multiple rearrangement architectures present tandem duplications particularly common cancers perhaps reflecting specific defect dna maintenance short overlapping sequences rearrangement junctions indicate mediated non-homologous end-joining dna repair although varying sequence patterns indicate multiple processes type operative several expressed in-frame fusion genes identified none recurrent study provides new perspective cancer genomes highlighting diversity somatic rearrangements potential contribution cancer development
