quasispecies diversity determines pathogenesis cooperative interactions viral population
rna virus population consist single genotype rather ensemble related sequences termed quasispecies- quasispecies arise rapid genomic evolution powered high mutation rate rna viral replication- although high mutation rate dangerous virus results nonviable individuals hypothesized high mutation rates create cloud potentially beneficial mutations population level afford viral quasispecies greater probability evolve adapt new environments challenges infection- mathematical models predict viral quasispecies simply collection diverse mutants group interactive variants together contribute characteristics population according view viral populations rather individual variants target evolutionary selection test hypothesis examining consequences limiting genomic diversity viral populations find poliovirus carrying high-fidelity polymerase replicates wild-type levels generates less genomic diversity unable adapt adverse growth conditions infected animals reduced viral diversity leads loss neurotropism attenuated pathogenic phenotype notably using chemical mutagenesis expand quasispecies diversity high-fidelity virus infection restores neurotropism pathogenesis analysis viruses isolated brain provides direct evidence complementation members quasispecies indicating selection indeed occurs population level rather individual variants study provides direct evidence fundamental prediction quasispecies theory establishes link mutation rate population dynamics pathogenesis
