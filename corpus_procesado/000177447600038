steering attosecond electron wave packets light 
photoelectrons excited extreme ultraviolet x-ray photons presence strong laser field generally suffer spread energies due absorption emission laser photons demonstrate emitted electron wave packet temporally confined small fraction oscillation period interacting light wave energy spectrum can down-shifted many times laser photon energy without substantial broadening light wave can accelerate decelerate electrons drift velocity ie steer electron wave packet like classical particle capability strictly relies sub-femtosecond duration ionizing x-ray pulse timing phase light wave similar accuracy offering simple potentially single-shot diagnostic tool attosecond pump-probe spectroscopy
