intracellular alpha-ketoglutarate maintains pluripotency embryonic stem cells 
role cellular metabolism regulating cell proliferation differentiation remains poorly understood example mammalian cells proliferate without exogenous glutamine supplementation even though glutamine non-essential amino acid show mouse embryonic stem es cells grown conditions maintain naive pluripotency capable proliferation absence exogenous glutamine despite es cells consume high levels exogenous glutamine metabolite available comparison differentiated cells naive es cells utilize glucose glutamine catabolism maintain high level intracellular alpha-ketoglutarate alpha kg consequently naive es cells exhibit elevated alpha kg succinate ratio promotes histone/dna demethylation maintains pluripotency direct manipulation intracellular alpha kg/succinate ratio sufficient regulate multiple chromatin modifications including h3k27me3 ten-eleven translocation tet-dependent dna demethylation contribute regulation pluripotency-associated gene expression vitro supplementation cell-permeable alpha kg directly supports es-cell self-renewal cell-permeable succinate promotes differentiation work reveals intracellular alpha kg/succinate levels can contribute maintenance cellular identity mechanistic role transcriptional epigenetic state stem cells
