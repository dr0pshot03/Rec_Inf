athabasca valles mars: lava-draped channel system 
athabasca valles young outflow channel system mars may carved catastrophic water floods however images acquired high-resolution imaging science experiment camera onboard mars reconnaissance orbiter spacecraft reveal athabasca valles now entirely draped thin layer solidified lava-the remnant once-swollen river molten rock lava erupted fissure inundated channels drained downstream geologically recent times purported ice features athabasca valles distal basin cerberus palus actually composed lava similar volcanic processes may operated ostensibly fluvial channels explain part landers sent investigate sites ancient flooding mars predominantly found lava surface instead
