close-pair binary distant triple supermassive black hole system 
galaxies believed evolve merging lead hosting multiple supermassive black holes- four known triple black hole systems- closest black hole pair kiloparsecs apart third component system kiloparsecs far gravitational sphere influence parsecs black hole mass one billion times sun previous searches compact black hole systems concluded rare tightest binary system separation parsecs ref report observations triple black hole system redshift z closest pair separated parsecs significantly distant earth known binary comparable orbital separation effect tight pair introduce rotationally symmetric helical modulation structure large-scale radio jets provides useful way search tight pairs without needing extremely high resolution observations found tight pair searching six galaxies conclude tight pairs common hitherto believed important observational constraint low-frequency gravitational wave experiments
