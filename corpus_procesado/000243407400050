h-ns-like stealth protein aids horizontal dna transmission bacteria
sfh protein encoded self-transmissible plasmids involved human typhoid closely related global regulator h-ns found sfh provides stealth function allows plasmids transmitted new bacterial hosts minimal effects fitness introducing plasmid without sfh gene imposes mild h-ns phenotype severe loss fitness due titration cellular pool h-ns a+t-rich plasmid stealth strategy seems used widely aid horizontal dna transmission important implications bacterial evolution
