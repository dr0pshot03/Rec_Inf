lunar radar sounder observations subsurface layers nearside maria moon 
observations subsurface geology moon help advance understanding lunar origin evolution radar sounding kaguya spacecraft revealed subsurface layers apparent depth several hundred meters nearside maria comparison surface geology serenitatis basin implies prominent echoes probably buried regolith layers accumulated depositional hiatus mare basalts stratification indicates tectonic quiescence billion years ago mare ridges formed subsequently basalts accumulated quiet period total thickness hundred meters observations suggest mascon loading produce tectonics serenitatis billion years ago global cooling probably dominated tectonics billion years ago
