uniform resonant chaotic mixing fluid flows 
laminar flows can produce particle trajectories chaotic nearby tracers separating exponentially time time-periodic two-dimensional flows steady three-dimensional 3d flows enhancements mixing due chaotic advection typically limited impenetrable transport barriers form boundaries ordered chaotic mixing regions however time-dependent 3d flows proposed theoretically- completely uniform mixing possible resonant mechanism called singularity-induced diffusion thought case even time-dependent 3d perturbations infinitesimally small important establish conditions uniform mixing possible whether conditions met flows typically occur nature report experimental numerical studies mixing laminar vortex flow weakly 3d weakly time-periodic system oscillating horizontal vortex chain produced magnetohydrodynamic technique weak vertical secondary flow forced spontaneously ekman pumping-a mechanism common vortical flows rigid boundaries occurring many geophysical industrial biophysical flows observe completely uniform mixing predicted- singularity-induced diffusion oscillation periods close typical circulation times
