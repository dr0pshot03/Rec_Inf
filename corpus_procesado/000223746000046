restricted growth schwann cells lacking cajal bands slows conduction myelinated nerves
nerve impulses propagated nodes ranvier myelinated nerves vertebrates internodal distances proposed affect velocity nerve impulse conduction however direct evidence lacking cellular mechanisms might regulate length myelinated segments unknown ramon y cajal described longitudinal transverse bands cytoplasm trabeculae internodal schwann cells suggested nutritive function show internodal growth wild-type nerves precisely matched nerve extension disruption cytoplasmic bands periaxin-null mice impairs schwann cell elongation nerve growth contrast myelination proceeds normally capacity wild-type mutant schwann cells elongate cell-autonomous indicating passive stretching can account lengthening internode limb growth predicted theoretical grounds decreased internodal distances strikingly decrease conduction velocities affect motor function propose microtubule-based transport longitudinal bands cajal permits internodal schwann cells lengthen response axonal growth thus ensuring rapid nerve impulse transmission
