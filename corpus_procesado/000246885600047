physical model decay preservation marine organic carbon 
degradation marine organic carbon provides major source atmospheric carbon dioxide whereas preservation sediments results accumulation oxygen processes involve slow decay chemically recalcitrant compounds physical protection assess importance physical protection constructed reaction-diffusion model organic matter differs accessibility microbial degradation intrinsic reactivity model predicts organic matter decays logarithmically time t decay rates decrease approximately x t- burial analyses sediment-core data consistent predictions
