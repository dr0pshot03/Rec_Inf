star-formation history universe stellar populations nearby galaxies 
determination star-formation history universe key goal modern cosmology crucial understanding galactic structures form evolve observations1- young stars distant galaxies different times past indicated stellar birthrate peaked eight billion years ago declining factor around ten present value report analysis fossil record current stellar populations nearby galaxies obtained complete star-formation history results broadly support derived high-redshift galaxies find however peak star formation recent-around five billion years ago also show bigger stellar mass galaxy earlier stars formed indicates high low-mass galaxies different histories
