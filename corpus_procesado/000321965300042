crystal structure nlrc4 reveals autoinhibition mechanism
nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor nlr proteins oligomerize multiprotein complexes termed inflammasomes activated autoinhibition mechanism remains poorly defined report crystal structure mouse nlrc4 closed form adenosine diphosphate-mediated interaction central nucleotide-binding domain nbd winged-helix domain whd critical stabilizing closed conformation nlrc4 helical domain hd2 repressively contacted conserved functionally important alpha-helix nbd c-terminal leucine-rich repeat lrr domain positioned sterically occlude one side nbd domain consequently sequester nlrc4 monomeric state disruption adp-mediated nbd-whd nbd-hd2/nbd-lrr interactions resulted constitutive activation nlrc4 together data reveal nbd-organized cooperative autoinhibition mechanism nlrc4 provide insight activation
