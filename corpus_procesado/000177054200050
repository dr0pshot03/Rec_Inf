fork reversal ssdna accumulation stalled replication forks owing checkpoint defects 
checkpoint-mediated control replicating chromosomes essential preventing cancer yeast rad53 kinase protects stalled replication forks pathological rearrangements characterize mechanisms controlling fork integrity analyzed replication intermediates formed response replication blocks using electron microscopy forks wild-type cells accumulate short single-stranded regions likely causes checkpoint activation whereas rad53 mutants exhibit extensive single-stranded gaps hemi-replicated intermediates consistent lagging-strand synthesis defect rad53 cells accumulate holliday junctions fork reversal speculate checkpoint mutants abnormal replication intermediates begin form uncoordinated replication processed unscheduled recombination pathways causing genome instability
