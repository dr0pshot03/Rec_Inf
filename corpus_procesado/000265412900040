architecture mutualistic networks minimizes competition increases biodiversity 
main theories biodiversity either neglect species interactions assume species interact randomly however recent empirical work revealed ecological networks highly structured- lack theory takes account structure interactions precludes assessment implications network patterns biodiversity use combination analytical empirical approaches quantify influence network architecture number coexisting species case study consider mutualistic networks plants animal pollinators seed dispersers- networks found highly nested specialist species interacting proper subsets species interact generalist show nestedness reduces effective interspecific competition enhances number coexisting species furthermore show nested network will naturally emerge new species likely enter community minimal competitive load nested networks seem occur many biological social contexts- suggesting results relevant wide range fields
