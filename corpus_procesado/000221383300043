preference vibrational translational energy gas-surface reaction
state-resolved gas-surface reactivity measurements revealed vibrational excitation nu antisymmetric c-h stretch activates methane dissociation efficiently translational energy methane molecules vibrational ground state require kilojoules per mole kj/mol translational energy attain reactivity enhancement provided kj/mol nu excitation result contradicts key assumption underlying statistical theories gas-surface reactivity provides direct experimental evidence central role vibrational energy can play activating gas-surface reactions
