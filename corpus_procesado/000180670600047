stimulus-induced oscillations occur visual olfactory- somatosensory systems several experimental theoretical- studies shown oscillations can generated inhibitory connections neurons effects realistic spatiotemporal sensory input oscillatory network dynamics overall functional roles oscillations sensory processing poorly understood weakly electric fish must detect electric field modulations produced prey spatially localized communication spatially diffuse signals show vivo recordings sensory pyramidal neurons animals produce oscillatory response communication-like stimuli prey-like stimuli basis well-characterized circuitry construct network model pyramidal neurons predicts diffuse delayed inhibitory feedback required achieve oscillatory behaviour response communication-like stimuli prediction experimentally verified reversible blockade feedback inhibition removes oscillatory behaviour presence communication-like stimuli results show sensory system can use inhibitory feedback mechanism toggle oscillatory non-oscillatory firing states associated naturalistic stimulus
