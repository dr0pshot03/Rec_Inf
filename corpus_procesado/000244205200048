notch signalling limits angiogenic cell behaviour developing zebrafish arteries 
recent evidence indicates growing blood-vessel sprouts consist endothelial cells distinct cell fates behaviours12; however clear signals determine sprout cell characteristics show notch signalling necessary restrict angiogenic cell behaviour tip cells developing segmental arteries zebrafish embryo absence notch signalling component rbpsuh recombining binding protein suppressor hairless observed excessive sprouting segmental arteries whereas notch activation suppresses angiogenesis mosaic analysis find cells lacking rbpsuh preferentially localize terminal position developing sprouts contrast cells notch signalling activated excluded tip-cell position vivo time-lapse analysis reveals endothelial tip cells undergo stereotypical pattern proliferation migration sprouting absence notch nearly sprouting endothelial cells exhibit tip-cell behaviour leading excessive numbers cells within segmental arteries furthermore find flt4 fms-related tyrosine kinase also called vegfr3 expressed segmental artery tip cells becomes ectopically expressed throughout sprout absence notch loss flt4 can partially restore normal endothelial cell number rbpsuh-deficient segmental arteries finally loss notch ligand dll4 delta-like also leads increased number endothelial cells within segmental arteries together studies indicate proper specification cell identity position behaviour developing blood-vessel sprout required normal angiogenesis implicate notch signalling pathway process
