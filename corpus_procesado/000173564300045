dna reveals high dispersal synchronizing population dynamics canada lynx 
population dynamics canada lynx lynx canadensis interest ecologists nearly sixty years1- two competing hypotheses concerning lynx population dynamics large-scale spatial synchrony currently debated first suggests dispersal substantial among lynx populations5 second proposes lynx periphery range exist small isolated patches maintain cycle synchrony via correlation extrinsic environmental factors2 resolving nature lynx population dynamics dispersal important ecological theory conservation threatened lynx populations: lack knowledge connectivity populations southern periphery lynxs geographic range delayed legal listing united states6 test competing hypotheses using microsatellite dna markers lynx samples collection sites core periphery lynxs geographic range show high gene flow despite separation distances greater km supporting dispersal hypothesis therefore suggest management actions contiguous united states focus maintaining connectivity core lynxs geographic range
