dna reveals high dispersal synchronizing population dynamics canada lynx
population dynamics canada lynx lynx canadensis interest ecologists nearly sixty years- two competing hypotheses concerning lynx population dynamics large-scale spatial synchrony currently debated first suggests dispersal substantial among lynx populations second proposes lynx periphery range exist small isolated patches maintain cycle synchrony via correlation extrinsic environmental factors resolving nature lynx population dynamics dispersal important ecological theory conservation threatened lynx populations: lack knowledge connectivity populations southern periphery lynxs geographic range delayed legal listing united states test competing hypotheses using microsatellite dna markers lynx samples collection sites core periphery lynxs geographic range show high gene flow despite separation distances greater km supporting dispersal hypothesis therefore suggest management actions contiguous united states focus maintaining connectivity core lynxs geographic range
