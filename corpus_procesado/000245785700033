experimental test non-local realism 
working scientists hold fast concept realism viewpoint according external reality exists independent observation quantum physics shattered cornerstone beliefs according bells theorem theory based joint assumption realism locality meaning local events affected actions space-like separated regions variance certain quantum predictions experiments entangled pairs particles amply confirmed quantum predictions thus rendering local realistic theories untenable maintaining realism fundamental concept therefore necessitate introduction spooky actions defy locality show theory experiment broad rather reasonable class non-local realistic theories incompatible experimentally observable quantum correlations experiment measure previously untested correlations two entangled photons show correlations violate inequality proposed leggett non-local realistic theories result suggests giving concept locality sufficient consistent quantum experiments unless certain intuitive features realism abandoned
