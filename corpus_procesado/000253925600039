diversity productivity peak intermediate dispersal rate evolving metacommunities 
positive relationships species diversity productivity reported number ecosystems theoretical experimental studies attempted determine mechanisms generate pattern short timescales little attention given problem understanding diversity productivity linked evolutionary timescales investigate role dispersal determining diversity productivity evolutionary timescales using experimental metacommunities bacterium pseudomonas fluorescens assembled divergent natural selection show regional diversity productivity peak intermediate dispersal rate moreover demonstrate two patterns linked: selection intermediate rates dispersal leads high niche differentiation genotypes allowing greater coverage heterogeneous environment higher regional productivity argue processes operate ecological evolutionary timescales jointly considered attempting understand emergence ecosystem level properties diversity function relationships
