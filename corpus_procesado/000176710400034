pressure-induced insulator-conductor transition photoconducting organic liquid-crystal film 
intermolecular separation determines extent orbital overlap thus rate electron transfer neighbouring molecules organic crystal crystal compressed resistivity decreases owing diminishing intermolecular distance1 metal-insulator transitions observed applying hydrostatic pressure example langmuir films metal nanoparticles23 previous attempts observe clear transition point organic crystals anthracene tetracene successful owing difficulties electrically insulating high-pressure cell4 report different approach using sample photoconductive forms organized film cylindrical tip similar to100 mum diameter used compress sample instead piston/cylinder structure entirely eliminating problem electrical insulation furthermore illuminating sample laser conductivity sample increased several orders magnitude monitoring photocurrent sensitivity - level changes resistivity low pressure monitored observe sharp increase current indicate transition hopping delocalized conduction
