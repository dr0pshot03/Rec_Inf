notch-mediated restoration regenerative potential aged muscle 
hallmark aging diminished regenerative potential tissues mechanism decline unknown analysis injured muscle revealed age resident precursor cells satellite cells markedly impaired propensity proliferate produce myoblasts necessary muscle regeneration due insufficient up-regulation notch ligand delta thus diminished activation notch aged regenerating muscle inhibition notch impaired regeneration young muscle whereas forced activation notch restored regenerative potential old muscle thus notch signaling key determinant muscle regenerative potential declines age
