alpha e-catenin controls cerebral cortical size regulating hedgehog signaling pathway
development cells monitor adjust rates accumulation produce organs predetermined size show central nervous system-specific deletion essential adherens junction gene alpha e-catenin causes abnormal activation hedgehog pathway resulting shortening cell cycle decreased apoptosis cortical hyperplasia propose alpha e-catenin connects cell-density-dependent adherens junctions developmental hedgehog pathway connection may provide negative feedback loop controlling size developing cerebral cortex
