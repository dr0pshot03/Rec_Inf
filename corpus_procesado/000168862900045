mannose phosphate receptors mprs deliver lysosomal hydrolases golgi endosomes return golgi complex tip47 recognizes cytoplasmic domains mprs required endosome-to-golgi transport show tip47 also bound directly rab9 guanosine triphosphatase gtpase active gtp-bound conformation moreover rab9 increased affinity tip47 cargo functional rab9 binding site required tip47 stimulation mpr transport vivo thus cytosolic cargo selection device may selectively recruited onto specific organelle vesicle budding might coupled presence active rab gtpase
