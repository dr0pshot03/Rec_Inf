phosphodiesterase 9a controls nitric-oxide-independent cgmp hypertrophic heart disease 
cyclic guanosine monophosphate cgmp second messenger molecule transduces nitric-oxide-and natriuretic-peptide-coupled signalling stimulating phosphorylation changes protein kinase g enhancing cgmp synthesis blocking degradation phosphodiesterase type 5a pde5a protects cardiovascular disease however cgmp stimulation alone limited counter-adaptions including pde upregulation furthermore although pde5a regulates nitric-oxide-generated cgmp nitric oxide signalling often depressed heart disease pdes controlling natriuretic-peptide-coupled cgmp remain uncertain show cgmp-selective pde9a refs expressed mammalian heart including humans upregulated hypertrophy cardiac failure pde9a regulates natriuretic-peptide-rather nitric-oxide-stimulated cgmp heart myocytes muscle genetic selective pharmacological inhibition protects pathological responses neurohormones sustained pressure-overload stress pde9a inhibition reverses pre-established heart disease independent nitric oxide synthase nos activity whereas pde5a inhibition requires active nos transcription factor activation phosphoproteome analyses myocytes pde selectively inhibited reveals substantial differential targeting phosphorylation changes pde5a inhibition sensitive nos activation thus unlike pde5a pde9a can regulate cgmp signalling independent nitric oxide pathway role stress-induced heart disease suggests potential therapeutic target
