boson sampling photonic chip
although universal quantum computers ideally solve problems factoring integers exponentially efficiently classical machines formidable challenges building devices motivate demonstration simpler problem-specific algorithms still promise quantum speedup constructed quantum boson-sampling machine qbsm sample output distribution resulting nonclassical interference photons integrated photonic circuit problem thought exponentially hard solve classically unlike universal quantum computation boson sampling merely requires indistinguishable photons linear state evolution detectors benchmarked qbsm three four photons analyzed sources sampling inaccuracy scaling larger devices offer first definitive quantum-enhanced computation
