key enzyme biogenesis lysosomes protease regulates cholesterol metabolism
mucolipidosis ii severe lysosomal storage disorder caused defects alpha beta subunits hexameric n-acetylglucosamine--phosphotransferase complex essential formation mannose phosphate targeting signal lysosomal enzymes cleavage membrane-bound alpha/beta-subunit precursor unknown protease required catalytic activity found alpha/beta-subunit precursor cleaved site protease s1p activates sterol regulatory element-binding proteins response cholesterol deprivation s1p-deficient cells failed activate alpha/beta-subunit precursor exhibited mucolipidosis ii-like phenotype thus s1p functions biogenesis lysosomes lipid-independent phenotypes s1p deficiency may caused lysosomal dysfunction
