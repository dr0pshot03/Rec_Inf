mott insulator fermionic atoms optical lattice 
strong interactions electrons solid material can lead surprising properties prime example mott insulator suppression conductivity occurs result interactions rather filled bloch band proximity mott insulating phase fermionic systems origin many intriguing phenomena condensed matter physics notably high temperature superconductivity hubbard model encompasses essential physics mott insulator also applies quantum gases trapped optical lattice therefore now possible access regime tools developed atomic physics however atomic mott insulator far realized gas bosons lack rich peculiar nature fermions report formation mott insulator repulsively interacting two component fermi gas optical lattice identified three features: drastic suppression doubly occupied lattice sites strong reduction compressibility inferred response double occupancy increase atom number appearance gapped mode excitation spectrum direct control interaction strength allows us compare mott insulating regime non interacting regime without changing tunnel coupling confinement results pave way studies mott insulator including spin ordering ultimately question d wave superfluidity
