nature pristine noble gases mantle plumes
high-precision noble gas data show hawaiian icelandic mantle plume sources contain uniquely primitive neon composed moderately nucleogenic neon primordial component indistinguishable meteoritic occurrence solar neon suggests earths solar-type rare gas inventory acquired accretion small planetesimals previously irradiated solar wind early sun however nonradiogenic argon krypton xenon isotopes derived mantle display nonsolar compositions indicate atmosphere-like fingerprint due recent subduction
