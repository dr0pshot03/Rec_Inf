interpreting cancer genomes using systematic host network perturbations tumour virus proteins 
genotypic differences greatly influence susceptibility resistance disease understanding genotype-phenotype relationships requires phenotypes viewed manifestations network properties rather simply result individual genomic variations genome sequencing efforts identified numerous germline mutations large numbers somatic genomic alterations associated predisposition cancer however remains difficult distinguish background passenger cancer mutations causal driver mutations data sets human viruses intrinsically depend host cell course infection can elicit pathological phenotypes similar arising mutations test hypothesis genomic variations tumour viruses may cause cancer related mechanisms systematically examining host interactome transcriptome network perturbations caused dna tumour virus proteins resulting integrated viral perturbation data reflects rewiring host cell networks highlights pathways notch signalling apoptosis go awry cancer show systematic analyses host targets viral proteins can identify cancer genes success rate par identification functional genomics large-scale cataloguing tumour mutations together complementary approaches increase specificity cancer gene identification combining systems-level studies pathogen-encoded gene products genomic approaches will facilitate prioritization cancer-causing driver genes advance understanding genetic basis human cancer
