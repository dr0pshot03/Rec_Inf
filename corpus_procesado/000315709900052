aire-dependent thymic development tumor-associated regulatory t cells
despite considerable interest modulation tumor-associated foxp3+ regulatory t cells t-regs therapeutic benefit little known developmental origins cells nature antigens recognize identified endogenous population antigen-specific t-regs termed mj23 t-regs found recurrently enriched tumors mice oncogene-driven prostate cancer mj23 t-regs reactive tumor-specific antigen instead recognized prostate-associated antigen present tumor-free mice mj23 t-regs underwent autoimmune regulator aire-dependent thymic development male female mice thus aire-mediated expression peripheral tissue antigens drives thymic development subset organ-specific t-regs likely coopted tumors developing within associated organ
