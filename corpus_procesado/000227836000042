genome-wide non-mendelian inheritance extra-genomic information arabidopsis 
fundamental tenet classical mendelian genetics allelic information stably inherited one generation next resulting predictable segregation patterns differing alleles although several exceptions principle known represent specialized cases mechanistically restricted either limited set specific genes example mating type conversion yeast specific types alleles example alleles containing transposons repeated sequences show arabidopsis plants homozygous recessive mutant alleles organ fusion gene hothead hth can inherit allele-specific dna sequence information present chromosomal genome parents present previous generations previously undescribed process shown occur dna sequence polymorphisms examined therefore seems general mechanism extragenomic inheritance dna sequence information postulate genetic restoration events result template-directed process makes use ancestral rna-sequence cache
