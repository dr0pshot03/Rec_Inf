genome-wide non-mendelian inheritance extra-genomic information arabidopsis 
fundamental tenet classical mendelian genetics allelic information stably inherited one generation next resulting predictable segregation patterns differing alleles1 although several exceptions principle known represent specialized cases mechanistically restricted either limited set specific genes example mating type conversion yeast2 specific types alleles example alleles containing transposons3 repeated sequences4 show arabidopsis plants homozygous recessive mutant alleles organ fusion gene hothead5 hth can inherit allele-specific dna sequence information present chromosomal genome parents present previous generations previously undescribed process shown occur dna sequence polymorphisms examined therefore seems general mechanism extragenomic inheritance dna sequence information postulate genetic restoration events result template-directed process makes use ancestral rna-sequence cache
