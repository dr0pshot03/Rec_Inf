ultrafast vibrational dynamics water interfaces
time-resolved sum-frequency vibrational spectroscopy permits study hitherto neglected ultrafast vibrational dynamics neat water interfaces measurements interfacial bonded oh stretch modes revealed relaxation behavior sub-picosecond time scales close resemblance bulk water vibrational excitation followed spectral diffusion vibrational relaxation thermalization hydrogen-bonding network dephasing excitation occurs < femtoseconds population relaxation dangling oh stretch found time constant picoseconds excitation transfer hydrogen-bonded unbonded oh stretches water molecules surrounded acetone
