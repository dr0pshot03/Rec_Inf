adaptive regulation neuronal excitability voltage-independent potassium conductance
many neurons receive continuous tonic synaptic input increases membrane conductance modifies spatial temporal integration excitatory signals- cerebellar granule cells although frequency inhibitory synaptic currents relatively low spillover synaptically released gaba gamma aminobutyric acid gives rise persistent conductance mediated gabaa receptor- also modifies excitability granule cells show tonic conductance absent granule cells lack alpha6 delta subunits gabaa receptor response granule cells excitatory synaptic input remains unaltered owing increase leak conductance present rest properties characteristic two-pore-domain k+ channel task refs results highlight importance tonic inhibition mediated gabaa receptors loss triggers form homeostatic plasticity leading change magnitude voltage-independent k+ conductance maintains normal neuronal behaviour
