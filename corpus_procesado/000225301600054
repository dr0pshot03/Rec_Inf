human polyomavirus jcv uses serotonin receptors infect cells
human polyomavirus jcv causes fatal demyelinating disease progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy immunocompromised patients found serotonergic receptor sht2ar act cellular receptor jcv human glial cells sht2a receptor antagonists inhibited jcv infection monoclonal antibodies directed 5ht2a receptors blocked infection glial cells jcv sv40 transfection 5ht2a receptor-negative hela cells 5ht2a receptor rescued virus infection infection blocked antibody 5ht2a receptor tagged sht2a receptor colocalized labeled jcv endosomal compartment following internalization serotonin receptor antagonists may thus useful treatment progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy
