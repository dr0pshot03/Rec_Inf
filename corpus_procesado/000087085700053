crystal structure photoprotein aequorin angstrom resolution
aequorin calcium-sensitive photoprotein originally obtained jellyfish aequorea aequorea high sensitivity calcium ions biologically harmless aequorin widely used probe monitor intracellular levels free calcium aequorin molecule contains four helix-loop-helix ef-hand domains three can bind calcium molecule also contains coelenterazine chromophoric ligand calcium added protein complex decomposes apoaequorin coelenteramide co2 accompanied emission light apoaequorin can regenerated active aequorin absence calcium incubation coelenterazine oxygen thiol agent cloning expression complementary dna aequorin first reported refs growth crystals recombinant protein described however techniques recently developed prepare recombinant aequorin highest purity permitting full crystallographic study report structure recombinant aequorin determined x-ray crystallography aequorin found globular molecule containing hydrophobic core cavity accommodates ligand coelenterazine--hydroperoxide structure shows protein components stabilizing peroxide suggests mechanism calcium activation may occur
