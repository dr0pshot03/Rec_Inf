plectasin peptide antibiotic therapeutic potential saprophytic fungus
animals higher plants express endogenous peptide antibiotics called defensins small cysteine-rich peptides active bacteria fungi viruses describe plectasin first defensin isolated fungus saprophytic ascomycete pseudoplectania nigrella plectasin primary secondary tertiary structures closely resemble defensins found spiders scorpions dragonflies mussels recombinant plectasin produced high commercially viable yield purity vitro recombinant peptide especially active streptococcus pneumoniae including strains resistant conventional antibiotics plectasin showed extremely low toxicity mice cured experimental peritonitis pneumonia caused s pneumoniae efficaciously vancomycin penicillin findings identify fungi novel source antimicrobial defensins show therapeutic potential plectasin also suggest defensins insects molluscs fungi arose common ancestral gene
