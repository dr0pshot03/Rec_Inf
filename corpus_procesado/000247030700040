low atlantic hurricane activity 1970s 1980s compared past years 
hurricane activity north atlantic ocean increased significantly since refs trend attributed anthropogenically induced climate change natural variability primary cause remains uncertain changes frequency intensity hurricanes past can provide insights factors influence hurricane activity reliable observations hurricane activity north atlantic cover past decades construct record frequency major atlantic hurricanes past years using proxy records vertical wind shear sea surface temperature main controls formation major hurricanes kin region- corals marine sediment core record indicates average frequency major hurricanes decreased gradually 1760s early 1990s reaching anomalously low values 1970s 1980s furthermore phase enhanced hurricane activity since unusual compared periods high hurricane activity record thus appears represent recovery normal hurricane activity rather direct response increasing sea surface temperature comparison record reconstruction vertical wind shear indicates variability parameter primarily controlled frequency major hurricanes atlantic past years suggesting changes magnitude vertical wind shear will significant influence future hurricane activity
