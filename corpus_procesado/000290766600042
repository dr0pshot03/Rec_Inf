selaginella genome identifies genetic changes associated evolution vascular plants 
vascular plants appeared similar million years ago diverged several lineages two survive: euphyllophytes ferns seed plants lycophytes report genome sequence lycophyte selaginella moellendorffii selaginella first nonseed vascular plant genome reported comparing gene content evolutionarily diverse taxa found transition gametophyte sporophyte-dominated life cycle required far fewer new genes transition nonseed vascular flowering plant whereas secondary metabolic genes expanded extensively parallel lycophyte angiosperm lineages selaginella differs posttranscriptional gene regulation including small rna regulation repetitive elements absence trans-acting small interfering rna pathway extensive rna editing organellar genes
