low-temperature processing baroplastics pressure-induced flow
manufacturing plastics traditionally involves melt processing temperatures typically greater 200degreesc enable extrusion moulding pressure desired forms followed solidification process consumes energy can cause substantial degradation polymers additives flame retardants ultraviolet stabilizers limiting plastics performance recyclability recently reported application pressure induce melt-like behaviour block copolymer polystyrene-block-polyn-butyl methacrylate ps-b-pbma behaviour now demonstrated range block copolymer systems- polymers termed baroplastics- however case order-to-disorder transition gives rise accompanying change rheology soft solid melt observed temperatures far exceeding glass transition temperatures t-g components show baroplastic systems containing nanophase domains one high-t-g one low-t-g component can exhibit melt-like flow pressure ambient temperature apparent semi-solid partial mixing mechanism substantially preserves high-t-g phase systems shredded remoulded ten times evident property degradation baroplastics low-temperature formability promise lower energy consumption manufacture processing reduced use additives faster production improved recyclability also provide potential alternatives current thermoplastic elastomers rubber-modified plastics semi-crystalline polymers
