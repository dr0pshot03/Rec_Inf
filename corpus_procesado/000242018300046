predicting endpoints earthquake ruptures
active fault traces earthquakes occur generally continuous commonly composed segments separated discontinuities appear steps map view stress concentrations resulting slip discontinuities may slow stop rupture propagation hence play controlling role limiting length earthquake rupture examine mapped surface rupture traces historical strike slip earthquakes rupture lengths ranging km show two thirds endpoints strike slip earthquake ruptures associated fault steps termini active fault traces exists limiting dimension fault step km earthquake ruptures propagate rupture propagation ceases per cent time results practical importance seismic hazard analysis effort spent attempting place limits probable length future earthquakes mapped active faults physical insight dynamics earthquake rupture process gained observation limiting dimension appears largely independent earthquake rupture length follows magnitude stress changes volume affected stress changes driving edge laterally propagating ruptures largely similar invariable rupture process regardless distance event propagated will propagate
