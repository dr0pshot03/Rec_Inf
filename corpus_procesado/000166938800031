nuclear fission modes fragment mass asymmetries five-dimensional deformation space
nuclei undergoing fission can described multi-dimensional potential-energy surface guides nuclear shape evolution-from ground state intermediate saddle points finally configurations separated fission fragments now calculations lacked adequate exploration shape parameterization sufficient dimensionality yield features potential-energy surface multiple minima valleys saddle points ridges correspond characteristic observables fission process calculate analyse five-dimensional potential-energy landscapes based grid deformation points rnd observed fission features-such distributions fission fragment mass kinetic energy different energy thresholds symmetric asymmetric fission-are closely related topological features calculated five-dimensional energy landscapes
