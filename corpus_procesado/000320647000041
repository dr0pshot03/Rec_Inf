quantum coherent energy transfer varying pathways single light-harvesting complexes 
initial steps photosynthesis comprise absorption sunlight pigment-protein antenna complexes followed rapid highly efficient funneling excitation energy reaction center transport processes signatures unexpectedly long-lived coherences emerged two-dimensional ensemble spectra various light-harvesting complexes demonstrate ultrafast quantum coherent energy transfer within individual antenna complexes purple bacterium physiological conditions find quantum coherences electronically coupled energy eigenstates persist least femtoseconds distinct energy-transfer pathways change time can identified complex data suggest long-lived quantum coherence renders energy transfer photosynthetic systems robust presence disorder prerequisite efficient light harvesting
