role er export signals controlling surface potassium channel numbers 
little known identity endoplasmic reticulum er export signals used regulate number proteins cell surface describe two er export signals profoundly altered steady-state distribution potassium channels required channel localization plasma membrane transferred potassium channels g protein-coupled receptor er export signals increased number functional proteins cell surface thus er export membrane proteins necessarily limited folding assembly may control specific export signals
