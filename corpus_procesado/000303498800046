impacts biodiversity loss escalate time redundancy fades 
plant diversity generally promotes biomass production shape response curve changes time remains unclear critical knowledge gap shape relationship indicates extent loss first species will influence biomass production using two long-term > years biodiversity experiments show effects diversity biomass productivity increased became less saturating time analyses suggest effects diversity-dependent ecosystem feedbacks interspecific complementarity accumulate time causing high-diversity species combinations appeared functionally redundant early years become functionally unique time consequently simplification diverse ecosystems will likely greater negative impacts ecosystem functioning suggested short-term experiments
