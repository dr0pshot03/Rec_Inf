demixing simple fluids induced electric field gradients 
phase separation liquid mixtures mainly controlled temperature pressure can also influenced gravitational magnetic electric fields however weak coupling fields concentration fluctuations limits effect extreme conditions- example mixing induced uniform electric fields detectable temperatures within hundredths degree less phase transition temperature system studied- predict demonstrate electric fields can control phase separation behaviour mixtures simple liquids practical conditions provided fields non-uniform applying voltage v across unevenly spaced electrodes mum apart can reversibly induce demixing paraffin silicone oil 1k phase transition temperature mixture field gradients turned mixture becomes homogeneous direct control phase separation behaviour depends field intensity electrode geometry determining length-scale effect expect phenomenon will find number nanotechnological applications particularly benefits field gradients near small conducting objects
