scattering interference epitaxial graphene 
single sheet carbon graphene exhibits unexpected electronic properties arise quantum state symmetries restrict scattering charge carriers understanding role defects transport properties graphene central realizing future electronics based carbon scanning tunneling spectroscopy used measure quasiparticle interference patterns epitaxial graphene grown sic energy-resolved maps local density states reveal modulations two different length scales reflecting intravalley intervalley scattering although scattering graphene can suppressed symmetries dirac quasiparticles show source atomic-scale lattice defects wave functions different symmetries can mix
