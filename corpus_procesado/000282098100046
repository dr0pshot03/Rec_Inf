vibrio effector protein inositol phosphatase disrupts host cell membrane integrity
marine bacterium vibrio parahaemolyticus causes gastroenteritis humans encodes type iii effector protein vpa0450 contributes host cell death caused autophagy cell rounding cell lysis found vpa0450 inositol polyphosphate phosphatase hydrolyzed d5 phosphate plasma membrane phospholipid phosphatidylinositol -bisphosphate vpa0450 disrupted cytoskeletal binding sites inner surface membranes human cells caused plasma membrane blebbing compromised membrane integrity probably contributed cell death facilitating lysis thus bacterial pathogens can disrupt adaptor protein-binding sites required proper membrane cytoskeleton dynamics altering homeostasis membrane-bound inositol-signaling molecules
