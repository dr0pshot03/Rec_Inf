crystal structure human adenovirus angstrom resolution 
rational development adenovirus vectors therapeutic gene transfer hampered lack accurate structural information report x-ray structure angstrom resolution megadalton adenovirus capsid containing nearly million amino acids describe interactions major capsid protein hexon several accessory molecules stabilize capsid virus structure also reveals altered association penton base trimeric fiber protein perhaps reflecting early event cell entry high-resolution structure provides substantial advance toward understanding assembly cell entry mechanisms large double-stranded dna virus provides new opportunities improving adenovirus-mediated gene transfer
