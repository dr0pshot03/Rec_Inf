molecular dynamics simulation ice nucleation growth process leading water freezing
upon cooling water freezes ice familiar phase transition occurs widely nature yet unlike freezing simple liquids- never successfully simulated computer difficulty lies fact hydrogen bonding individual water molecules yields disordered three-dimensional hydrogen-bond network whose rugged complex global potential energy surface- permits large number possible network configurations result challenging reproduce freezing real water solid unique crystalline structure systems limited number possible disordered hydrogen-bond network structures confined water relatively easy locate pathway liquid state crystalline structure- pure spatially unconfined water however molecular dynamics simulations freezing severely hampered large number possible network configurations exist present molecular dynamics trajectory captures molecular processes involved freezing pure water find ice nucleation occurs sufficient number relatively long-lived hydrogen bonds develop spontaneously location forma fairly compact initial nucleus initial nucleus slowly changes shape size reaches stage allows rapid expansion resulting crystallization entire system
