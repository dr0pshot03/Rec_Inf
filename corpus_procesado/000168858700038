size albedo kuiper-belt object varuna
observations last decade revealed existence large number bodies orbiting sun beyond neptune known kuiper-belt objects kbos believed formed outer reaches protoplanetary disk around young sun little altered since probably source short-period comets kbos however difficult objects study distance earth even basic physical properties sizes albedos remain unknown previous size estimates came assuming albedo canonical value report simultaneous measurements thermal emission reflected optical light bright kbo varuna allow us determine independently size albedo varuna equivalent circular diameter d +- km red geometric albedo pr -+ surface darker plutos suggesting largely devoid fresh ice brighter previously assumed kbos
