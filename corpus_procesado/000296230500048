fast-folding proteins fold 
outstanding challenge field molecular biology understand process proteins fold characteristic three-dimensional structures report results atomic-level molecular dynamics simulations periods ranging mu s ms reveal set common principles underlying folding structurally diverse proteins simulations conducted single physics-based energy function proteins representing three major structural classes spontaneously repeatedly fold experimentally determined native structures early folding process protein backbone adopts nativelike topology certain secondary structure elements small number nonlocal contacts form cases folding follows single dominant route elements native structure appear order highly correlated propensity form unfolded state
