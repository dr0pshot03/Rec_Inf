systematic identification signal-activated stochastic gene regulation 
although much done elucidate biochemistry signal transduction gene regulatory pathways remains difficult understand predict quantitative responses integrate single-cell experiments stochastic analyses identify predictive models transcriptional dynamics osmotic stress response pathway saccharomyces cerevisiae generate models varying complexity use parameter estimation cross-validation analyses select predictive model model yields insight several dynamical features including multistep regulation switchlike activation several osmosensitive genes furthermore model correctly predicts transcriptional dynamics cells response different environmental genetic perturbations approach general facilitate predictive understanding signal-activated transcription genes pathways organisms
