optical resonances carbon nanotubes arise excitons 
optical transitions carbon nanotubes central importance nanotube characterization also provide insight nature excited states one-dimensional systems recent work suggests light absorption produces strongly correlated electron-hole states form excitons however difficult rule simpler model resonances arise van hove singularities associated one-dimensional bond structure nanotubes two-photon excitation spectroscopy bolsters exciton picture found binding energies similar millielectron volts semi-conducting single-walled nanotubes -nanometer diameters results demonstrate dominant role many-body interactions excited-state properties one-dimensional systems
