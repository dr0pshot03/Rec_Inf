supramolecular self-assembled molecules organic directing agent synthesis zeolites
solid materials uniform micropores zeolites can act selective catalysts adsorbents molecular mixtures separating molecules small enough enter pores leaving larger molecules behind zeolite microporous material high void volume despite widespread industrial use example molecular separations detergency capability petroleum-refining material limited owing poor acid-catalytic activity hydrothermal stability low hydrophobicity characteristics ultimately consequence low framework si/al ratio normally around one resulting high cationic fraction within pores cavities researchers modified properties type-a zeolites increasing si/al compositions ratio three- describe synthesis zeolite structures exhibiting high si/al ratios infinity pure silica synthesize materials named itq- using supramolecular organic structure-directing agent obtained self-assembly pi-pi type interactions two identical organic cationic moieties highly hydrophobic pure-silica zeolite can used hydrocarbon separations avoid oligomerization reactions whereas materials high si/al ratios give excellent shape-selective cracking additives increasing propylene yield fluid catalytic cracking operations also extended use supramolecular structure-directing agents synthesis range zeolites
