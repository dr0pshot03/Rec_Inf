sgk196 glycosylation-specific o-mannose kinase required dystroglycan function 
phosphorylated o-mannosyl trisaccharide [n-acetylgalactosamine-beta n-acetylglucosamine-beta phosphate--mannose] required dystroglycan bind laminin-g domain-containing extracellular proteins high affinity muscle brain however enzymes produce structure fully elucidated found glycosyltransferase-like domain-containing gtdc2 protein o-linked mannose beta -n-acetylglucosaminyltransferase whose product extended beta -n-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase2 b3galnt2 form o-mannosyl trisaccharide furthermore identified sgk196 atypical kinase phosphorylated position o-mannose specifically mannose modified gtdc2 b3galnt2 findings suggest mutations gtdc2 b3galnt2 sgk196 disrupt dystroglycan receptor function lead congenital muscular dystrophy
