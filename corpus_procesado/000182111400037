single-crystal gallium nitride nanotubes 
since discovery carbon nanotubes ref significant research efforts synthesize nanometre-scale tubular forms various solids- formation tubular nanostructure generally requires layered anisotropic crystal structure- reports nanotubes made silica alumina silicon metals layered crystal structure synthesized using carbon nanotubes porous membranes templates thin-film rolling nanotubes however either amorphous polycrystalline exist ultrahigh vacuum growth single-crystal semiconductor hollow nanotubes advantageous potential nanoscale electronics optoelectronics biochemical-sensing applications report epitaxial casting approach synthesis single-crystal gan nanotubes inner diameters nm wall thicknesses nm hexagonal zno nanowires used templates epitaxial overgrowth thin gan layers chemical vapour deposition system zno nanowire templates subsequently removed thermal reduction evaporation resulting ordered arrays gan nanotubes substrates templating process applicable many semiconductor systems
