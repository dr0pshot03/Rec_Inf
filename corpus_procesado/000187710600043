coordinated activation hsp70 chaperones 
hsp70s ubiquitous family molecular chaperones involved many cellular processes two hsp70s lhs1p kar2p required protein biogenesis yeast endoplasmic reticulum found lhs1p kar2p specifically interacted couple coordinately regulate respective activities lhs1p stimulated kar2p providing specific nucleotide exchange activity whereas kar2p reciprocally activated lhs1p adenosine triphosphatase atpase two atpase activities coupled coordinated regulation essential normal function vivo
