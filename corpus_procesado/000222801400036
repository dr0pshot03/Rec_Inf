single-shot read-out individual electron spin quantum dot
spin fundamental property elementary particles classically can viewed tiny magnetic moment measurement electron spin along direction external magnetic field can two outcomes: parallel anti-parallel field discreteness reflects quantum mechanical nature spin ensembles many spins found diverse applications ranging magnetic resonance imaging magneto-electronic devices individual spins considered carriers quantum information read-out single spin states achieved using optical techniques within reach magnetic resonance force microscopy however electrical read-out single spins- far remained elusive demonstrate electrical single-shot measurement state individual electron spin semiconductor quantum dot use spin-to-charge conversion single electron confined dot detect single-electron charge using quantum point contact spin measurement visibility similar to65% furthermore observe long single-spin energy relaxation times similar to0 ms magnetic field t encouraging use electron spins carriers quantum information
