cross talk interferon-gamma alpha/beta signaling components caveolar membrane domains
definition cellular responses cytokines often involves cross-communication respective receptors signaling interferon-gamma ifn-gamma shown depend ifn-alpha/beta receptor components although ifns transmit signals distinct receptor complexes ifn-alpha/beta receptor component ifnar1 facilitates efficient assembly ifn-gamma-activated transcription factors cross talk contingent constitutive subthreshold ifn-alpha/beta signaling association two nonligand-binding receptor components ifnar1 ifngr2 caveolar membrane domains aspect signaling cross talk ifns may apply cytokines
