high-quality electron beams laser wakefield accelerator using plasma-channel guiding
laser-driven accelerators particles accelerated electric field plasma wave wakefield driven intense laser demonstrated accelerating electric fields hundreds gv m- refs fields thousands times greater achievable conventional radiofrequency accelerators spurring interest laser accelerators compact next-generation sources energetic electrons radiation date however acceleration distances severely limited lack controllable method extending propagation distance focused laser pulse ensuing short acceleration distance results low-energy beams per cent electron energy spread- limits potential applications demonstrate laser accelerator produces electron beams energy spread per cent low emittance increased energy electrons mev technique involves use preformed plasma density channel guide relativistically intense laser resulting longer propagation distance results open way compact tunable high-brightness sources electrons radiation
