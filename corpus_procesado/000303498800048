elementary ca2+ signals endothelial trpv4 channels regulate vascular function 
major features transcellular signaling mechanism responsible endothelium-dependent regulation vascular smooth muscle tone unresolved identified local calcium ca2+ signals sparklets vascular endothelium resistance arteries represent ca2+ influx single trpv4 cation channels gating individual trpv4 channels within four-channel cluster cooperative activation three channels per cell causing maximal dilation activation endothelial cell intermediate ik small sk-conductance ca2+-sensitive potassium k+ channels endothelial-dependent muscarinic receptor signaling also acted largely trpv4 sparklet-mediated stimulation ik sk channels promote vasodilation results support concept ca2+ influx single trpv4 channels leveraged amplifier effect cooperative channel gating high ca2+ sensitivity ik sk channels cause vasodilation
