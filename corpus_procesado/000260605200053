deletion trpm7 disrupts embryonic development thymopoiesis without altering mg+ homeostasis
gene transient receptor potential melastatin like trpm7 encodes protein functions ion channel kinase trpm7 proposed required cellular mg+ homeostasis vertebrates deletion mouse trpm7 revealed essential embryonic development tissue specific deletion trpm7 t cell lineage disrupted thymopoiesis led developmental block thymocytes double negative stage progressive depletion thymic medullary cells however deletion trpm7 t cells affect acute uptake mg+ maintenance total cellular mg+ trpm7 deficient thymocytes exhibited dysregulated synthesis many growth factors necessary differentiation maintenance thymic epithelial cells thymic medullary cells lost signal transducer activator transcription activity accounts depletion trpm7 disrupted thymocytes
