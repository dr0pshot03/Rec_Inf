two-component regulator enterococcus faecalis cytolysin responds quorum-sensing autoinduction 
bacteria genus enterococcus main causes highly antibiotic-resistant infections acquired hospitals many clinical isolates enterococcus faecalis produce exotoxin called cytolysin contributes bacterial virulence addition toxin activity cytolysin bactericidal nearly gram-positive organisms understanding conditions regulate cytolysin expression advanced little since initial description show products two genes cylr1 cylr2 lack homologues known function work together repress transcription cytolysin genes derepression occurs specific cell density one cytolysin subunits reaches extracellular threshold concentration observations form basis model autoinduction cytolysin quorum-sensing mechanism involving two-component regulatory system
