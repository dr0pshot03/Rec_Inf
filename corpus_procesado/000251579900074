two stellar components halo milky way 
halo milky way provides unique elemental abundance kinematic information first objects form universe information can used tightly constrain models galaxy formation evolution although halo considered single component evidence dichotomy slowly emerged recent years inspection small samples halo objects show halo indeed clearly divisible two broadly overlapping structural components inner outer halo exhibit different spatial density profiles stellar orbits stellar metallicities abundances elements heavier helium inner halo modest net prograde rotation whereas outer halo exhibits net retrograde rotation peak metallicity one third inner halo properties indicate individual halo components probably formed fundamentally different ways successive dissipational inner dissipationless outer mergers tidal disruption proto galactic clumps
