understanding reactivity low temperatures: reactions oxygen atoms alkenes 
remarkable number reactions neutral free radicals neutral molecules shown remain rapid temperatures low kelvin rate coefficients generally increase temperature lowered examined reasons temperature dependence combined experimental theoretical study reactions op-atoms range alkenes factors control rate coefficients shown rather subtle excellent agreement obtained experimental results microcanonical transition state theory calculations based ab initio representations potential energy surfaces describing interaction reactants
