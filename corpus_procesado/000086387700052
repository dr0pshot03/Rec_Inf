specialized fatty acid synthesis african trypanosomes: myristate gpi anchors 
african trypanosomes cause sleeping sickness need massive amounts myristate remodel glycosyl phosphatidylinositol gpi anchors surface glycoproteins however believed parasite unable synthesize fatty acids myristate abundant hosts bloodstreams thus unclear trypanosomes meet myristate requirement found indeed synthesize fatty acids synthetic pathway unique major product myristate preferentially incorporated gpis lipids antibiotic thiolactomycin inhibited myristate synthesis killed parasite making pathway potential chemotherapeutic target
