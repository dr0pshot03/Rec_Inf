global assessment arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus diversity reveals low endemism 
global biogeography microorganisms remains largely unknown contrast well-studied diversity patterns macroorganisms used arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus dna plant-root samples collected worldwide determine global distribution plant symbionts found fungal communities reflected local environmental conditions spatial distance sites however despite fungi apparently possessing limited dispersal ability found % taxa multiple continents % six continents surveyed contrasts high spatial turnover fungal taxa endemism displayed plants global scale suggest biogeography fungi driven unexpectedly efficient dispersal probably via abiotic biotic vectors including humans
