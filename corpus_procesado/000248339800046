sirtuin inhibitors rescue alpha-synuclein-mediated toxicity models parkinsons disease
sirtuins members histone deacetylase family proteins participate variety cellular functions play role aging identified potent inhibitor sirtuin sirt2 found inhibition sirt2 rescued alpha-synuclein toxicity modified inclusion morphology cellular model parkinsons disease genetic inhibition sirt2 via small interfering rna similarly rescued alpha-synuclein toxicity furthermore inhibitors protected dopaminergic cell death vitro drosophila model parkinsons disease results suggest link neurodegeneration aging
