drosophila microbiome modulates host developmental metabolic homeostasis via insulin signaling
symbiotic microbiota profoundly affect many aspects host physiology however molecular mechanisms underlying host-microbe cross-talk largely unknown show pyrroloquinoline quinone-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase pqq-adh activity commensal bacterium acetobacter pomorum modulates insulin/insulin-like growth factor signaling iis drosophila regulate host homeostatic programs controlling developmental rate body size energy metabolism intestinal stem cell activity germ-free animals monoassociated pqq-adh mutant bacteria displayed severe deregulation developmental metabolic homeostasis importantly defects reversed enhancing host iis supplementing diet acetic acid metabolic product pqq-adh
