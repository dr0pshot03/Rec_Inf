superelastic effect polycrystalline ferrous alloys
superelastic alloys large deformation can revert memorized shape removing stress however stress increases increasing temperature limits practical use wide temperature range polycrystalline fe-mn-al-ni shape memory alloys show small temperature dependence superelastic stress small transformation entropy change brought magnetic contribution gibbs energies one alloy composition superelastic stress varies megapascal/degrees c temperature range degrees c
