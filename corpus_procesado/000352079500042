microrna control protein expression noise 
micrornas mirnas repress expression many genes metazoans accelerating messenger rna degradation inhibiting translation thereby reducing level protein however mirnas slightly reduce mean expression targeted proteins leading speculation role variability noise protein expression used mathematical modeling single-cell reporter assays show mirnas conjunction increased transcription decrease protein expression noise lowly expressed genes increase noise highly expressed genes genes regulated multiple mirnas show more-pronounced noise reduction estimate hundreds lowly expressed genes mouse embryonic stem cells reduced noise due substantial mirna regulation findings suggest mirnas confer precision protein expression thus offer plausible explanations commonly observed combinatorial targeting endogenous genes multiple mirnas well preferential targeting lowly expressed genes
