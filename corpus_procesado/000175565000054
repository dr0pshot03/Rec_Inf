stability real food webs: weak links long loops
increasing evidence strengths interactions among populations biological communities form patterns crucial system stability requires clarification precise form patterns come influence stability show real food webs interaction strengths organized trophic loops way long loops contain relatively many weak links show explain mathematically patterning enhances stability reduces maximum loop weight thus reduces amount intraspecific interaction needed matrix stability patterns brought biomass pyramids feature common ecosystems incorporation biomass pyramids food-web descriptions reveals tow weight tong loops stabilizes complex food webs loop-weight analysis useful toot exploring structure organization complex communities
