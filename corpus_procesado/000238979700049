three-dimensional structure myosin v inhibited state cryoelectron tomography 
unconventional myosin v myov actin-based molecular motor key function organelle mrna transport well membrane trafficking myov first member myosin superfamily shown processive meaning single motor protein can walk hand-over-hand along actin filament many steps detaching- full-length myov low actin-activated mgatpase activity low [ca2+] whereas expressed constructs lacking cargo-binding domain high activity regardless [ca2+] refs hydrodynamic data electron micrographs indicate active state extended whereas inactive state compact- show first three-dimensional structure myov inactive state myov molecule consists two heads contain amino-terminal motor domain followed lever arm binds six calmodulins heads followed coiled-coil dimerization domain s2 carboxy-terminal globular cargo-binding domain inactive structure bending myov head s2 junction places cargo-binding domain near motor domains atp-binding pocket indicating atpase inhibition might occur decreased rates nucleotide exchange actin-binding interfaces unobstructed lever arm oriented position typical strong actin-binding states structure indicates motor recycling cargo delivery might occur transport actively treadmilling actin filaments rather diffusion
