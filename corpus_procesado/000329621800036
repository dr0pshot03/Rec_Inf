uvrd facilitates dna repair pulling rna polymerase backwards 
uvrd helicase required nucleotide excision repair although role process well defined show escherichia coli uvrd binds rna polymerase transcription elongation using helicase/translocase activity forces rna polymerase slide backward along dna inducing backtracking uvrd exposes dna lesions shielded blocked rna polymerase allowing nucleotide excision repair enzymes gain access sites damage results establish uvrd bona fide transcription elongation factor contributes genomic integrity resolving conflicts transcription dna repair complexes furthermore show elongation factor nusa cooperates uvrd coupling transcription dna repair promoting backtracking recruiting nucleotide excision repair enzymes exposed lesions backtracking shared feature cellular rna polymerases propose mechanism enables rna polymerases function global dna damage scanners bacteria eukaryotes
