marine ice sheet collapse potentially way thwaites glacier basin west antarctica 
resting atop deep marine basin west antarctic ice sheet long considered prone instability using numerical model investigated sensitivity thwaites glacier ocean melt whether unstable retreat already way model reproduces observed losses forced ocean melt comparable estimates simulated losses moderate < mm per year sea level 21st century generally increase thereafter except possibly lowest-melt scenario simulations indicate early-stage collapse begun less certain time scale onset rapid > mm per year sea-level rise collapse different simulations within range years
