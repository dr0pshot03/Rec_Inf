forward scattering due slow-down intermediate h+hd > d+h reaction 
quantum dynamical processes near energy barrier separates reactants products influence detailed mechanism elementary chemical reactions occur fact processes can change product scattering behaviour expected simple collision considerations seen two classical reactions f + h -> hf + h h + h -> h + h isotopic variants case f + hd reaction role quantized trapped feshbach resonance state directly determined confirming previous conclusions feshbach resonances cause state-specific forward scattering product molecules forward scattering also observed h + d -> hd + d reaction attributed time-delayed mechanism- despite extensive experimental- theoretical- investigations details mechanism remain unclear present crossed-beam scattering experiments quantum calculations h + hd -> h + d reaction find motion system along reaction coordinate slows approaches top reaction barrier thereby allowing vibrations perpendicular reaction coordinate forward scattering reaction thus proceeds previously suggested well-defined quantized bottleneck state different trapped feshbach resonance states observed
