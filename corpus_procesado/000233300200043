nanofabricated media negative permeability visible frequencies 
great deal attention recently focused new class smart materials-so-called left-handed media-that exhibit highly unusual electromagnetic properties promise new device applications- left-handed materials require negative permeability m extreme condition far achieved frequencies microwave terahertz range- extension approach described ref achieve necessary high-frequency magnetic response visible optics presents formidable challenge- material-natural artificial-is known exhibit magnetism frequencies report nanofabricated medium consisting electromagnetically coupled pairs gold dots geometry carefully designed nm level medium exhibits strong magnetic response visible-light frequencies including band negative m magnetism arises owing excitation antisymmetric plasmon resonance high-frequency permeability qualitatively reveals via optical impedance matching results demonstrate feasibility engineering magnetism visible frequencies pave way towards magnetic left-handed components visible optics
