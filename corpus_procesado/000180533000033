spectral signature cosmological infall gas around first quasars
recent observations shown billion years big bang universe already lit bright quasars fuelled infall gas onto supermassive black holes masses early black holes inferred luminosities > solar masses m-circle dot difficult theoretical challenge explain like nearby quasars early objects formed central cores massive host galaxies formation hosts explained like local large galaxies assembled gravitationally inside massive > m-circle dot haloes dark matter hitherto observational evidence presence massive hosts surrounding haloes show cosmic gas surrounding halo must respond strong gravitational pull absorption infalling hydrogen produces distinct spectral signature signature can seen recent data
