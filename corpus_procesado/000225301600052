trpm4 regulates calcium oscillations t cell activation 
trpm4 recently described calcium-activated nonselective can cation channel mediates membrane depolarization however functional importance trpm4 context calcium ca2+ signaling effect cellular responses known molecular inhibition endogenous trpm4 t cells shown suppress trpm4 currents profound influence receptor-mediated ca2+ mobilization agonist-mediated oscillations intracellutar ca2+ concentration [ca2+]i driven store-operated ca2+ influx transformed sustained elevation [ca2+]i increase ca2+ influx enhanced interleukin- production thus trpm4-mediated depolarization modulates ca2+ oscillations downstream effects cytokine production t lymphocytes
