hdac6 microtubule-associated deacetylase 
reversible acetylation alpha-tubulin implicated regulating microtubule stability function distribution acetylated alpha-tubulin tightly controlled stereotypic acetylated alpha-tubulin abundant stable microtubules absent dynamic cellular structures neuronal growth cones leading edges fibroblasts however enzymes responsible regulating tubulin acetylation deacetylation known report member histone deacetylase family hdac6 functions tubulin deacetylase hdac6 localized exclusively cytoplasm associates microtubules localizes microtubule motor complex containing p150glued ref vivo overexpression hdac6 leads global deacetylation alpha-tubulin whereas decrease hdac6 increases alpha-tubulin acetylation vitro purified hdac6 potently deacetylates alpha-tubulin assembled microtubules furthermore overexpression hdac6 promotes chemotactic cell movement supporting idea hdac6-mediated deacetylation regulates microtubule-dependent cell motility results show hdac6 tubulin deacetylase provide evidence reversible acetylation regulates important biological processes beyond histone metabolism gene transcription
