ubiquitination new form alpha-synuclein parkin human brain: implications parkinsons disease
parkinsons disease pd common neurodegenerative disorder characterized progressive accumulation selected neurons protein inclusions containing alpha synuclein ubiquitin rare inherited forms pd caused autosomal dominant mutations alpha synuclein autosomal recessive mutations parkin e3 ubiquitin ligase hypothesized two gene products interact functionally namely parkin ubiquitinates alpha synuclein normally process altered autosomal recessive pd now identified protein complex normal human brain includes parkin e3 ubiquitin ligase ubch7 associated e2 ubiquitin conjugating enzyme new kilodalton glycosylated form alpha synuclein alpha sp22 substrate contrast normal parkin mutant parkin associated autosomal recessive pd failed bind alpha sp22 vitro ubiquitination assay alpha sp22 modified normal mutant parkin polyubiquitinated high molecular weight species accordingly alpha sp22 accumulated nonubiquitinated form parkin-deficient pd brains conclude alpha sp22 substrate parkins ubiquitin ligase activity normal human brain loss parkin function causes pathological alpha sp22 accumulation findings demonstrate critical biochemical reaction two pd-linked gene products suggest reaction underlies accumulation ubiquitinated alpha synuclein conventional pd
