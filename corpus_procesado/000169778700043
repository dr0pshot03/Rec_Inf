test general relativity three-dimensional orbital geometry binary pulsar
binary pulsars provide excellent system testing general relativity intrinsic rotational stability precision radio observations can used determine orbital dynamics measurements rate orbital decay two pulsars shown consistent emission gravitational waves predicted general relativity independent verification possible verification can principle obtained determining orbital inclination binary pulsar system using classical geometrical constraints permit measurement expected retardation pulse signal arising general relativistic curvature space-time vicinity companion object shapiro delay report high-precision radio observations binary millisecond pulsar psr j0437- establish three-dimensional structure orbit see shapiro delay predicted general relativity determine mass neutron star white dwarf companion determination masses necessary order understand origin evolution neutron stars
