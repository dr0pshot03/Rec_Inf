anderson localization non-interacting bose-einstein condensate
anderson localization waves disordered media originally predicted fifty years ago context transport electrons crystals phenomenon much general observed variety systems including light waves however anderson localization observed directly matter waves owing high degree control system parameters particular interaction strength ultracold atoms offer opportunities study disorder induced localization use non interacting bose einstein condensate study anderson localization experiment performed one dimensional quasi periodic lattice system features crossover extended exponentially localized states case purely random disorder higher dimensions localization clearly demonstrated investigations transport properties spatial momentum distributions characterize crossover finding critical disorder strength scales tunnelling energy atoms lattice controllable system may used investigate interplay disorder interaction ref references therein explore exotic quantum phases
