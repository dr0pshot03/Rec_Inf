interpretation tomography spectroscopy dual forms quantum computation 
important able determine state quantum system measure properties evolution state determination can achieved using tomography system subjected series experiments whereas spectroscopy can used probe energy spectrum associated systems evolution show quantum system whose state evolution can modelled quantum computer tomography spectroscopy can interpreted dual forms quantum computation specifically find phase estimation algorithm underlies quantum computers ability perform efficient simulations factorize large numbers can adapted tomography spectroscopy analogous situation encountered scattering experiments possible obtain information state scatterer interactions provide experimental demonstration tomographic application performing measurement wigner function phase space distribution quantum system purpose use three qubits formed spin-/ nuclei quantum computation involving liquid-state nuclear magnetic resonance
