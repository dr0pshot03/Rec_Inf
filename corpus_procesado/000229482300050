structural bioinformatics-based design selective irreversible kinase inhibitors 
active sites human protein kinase domains highly conserved makes design selective inhibitors formidable challenge used structural bioinformatics approach identify two selectivity filters threonine cysteine defined positions active site p90 ribosomal protein s6 kinase rsk fluoromethylketone inhibitor designed exploit selectivity filters potently selectively inactivated rsk1 rsk2 mammalian cells kinases one selectivity filter resistant inhibitor yet became sensitized genetic introduction second selectivity filter thus two amino acids distinguish rsk protein kinases sufficient confer inhibitor sensitivity
