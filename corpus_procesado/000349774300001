innate lymphoid cells regulate intestinal epithelial cell glycosylation 
fucosylation intestinal epithelial cells catalyzed fucosyltransferase fut2 major glycosylation mechanism host-microbiota symbiosis commensal bacteria induce epithelial fucosylation epithelial fucose used dietary carbohydrate many bacteria however molecular cellular mechanisms regulate induction epithelial fucosylation unknown show type innate lymphoid cells ilc3 induced intestinal epithelial fut2 expression fucosylation mice induction required cytokines interleukin lymphotoxin commensal bacteria-dependent independent manner respectively disruption intestinal fucosylation led increased susceptibility infection salmonella typhimurium data reveal role ilc3 shaping gut microenvironment regulation epithelial glycosylation
