temporal regulation egf signalling networks scaffold protein shc1
cell-surface receptors frequently use scaffold proteins recruit cytoplasmic targets rationale uncertain activated receptor tyrosine kinases example engage scaffolds shc1 contain phosphotyrosine ptyr-binding ptb domains using quantitative mass spectrometry show mammalian shc1 responds epidermal growth factor egf stimulation multiple waves distinct phosphorylation events protein interactions stimulation shc1 rapidly binds group proteins activate pro-mitogenic survival pathways dependent recruitment grb2 adaptor shc1 ptyr sites akt-mediated feedback phosphorylation shc1 ser recruits ptpn12 tyrosine phosphatase followed sub-network proteins involved cytoskeletal reorganization trafficking signal termination binds shc1 delayed kinetics largely sgk269 pseudokinase/adaptor protein ptpn12 acts switch convert shc1 ptyr/grb2-based signalling sgk269-mediated pathways regulate cell invasion morphogenesis shc1 scaffold therefore directs temporal flow signalling information egf stimulation
