formation immiscible alloy powders egg-type microstructure 
egg-type core microstructure one alloy encases another previously obtained experiments space working copper-iron base alloys prepared conventional gas atomization able obtain microstructure gravity conditions minor liquid phase always formed core egg sometimes also formed shell layer origin formation core microstructure can explained marangoni motion basis temperature dependence interfacial energy shows type powder can formed even cooling rate high
