magnetic trapping neutrons 
accurate measurement lifetime neutron unstable beta decay important understanding weak nuclear force creation matter big bang previous measurements neutron lifetime mainly limited certain systematic errors however principle avoided performing measurements neutrons stored magnetic tray neutral-particle charged-particle traps widely used studying composite elementary particles allow long interaction times isolation particles perturbing environments hereve report magnetic trapping neutrons trapping region filled superfluid he- used load neutrons trap scintillator detect decay neutrons trap lifetime -+ seconds mainly limited beta decay rather trap losses experiment verifies theoretical predictions regarding loading process magnetic trapping neutrons refinement method lead improved precision neutron lifetime measurement
