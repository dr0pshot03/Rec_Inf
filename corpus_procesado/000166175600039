computational design direct-bandgap semiconductors lattice-match silicon
crystalline silicon indirect-bandgap semiconductor making inefficient emitter light successful integration silicon-based electronics optical components will therefore require optically active example direct-bandgap materials can grown silicon high-quality interfaces well ordered materials effectively translates requirement materials lattice-match silicon: lattice mismatch generally causes cracks poor interface properties mismatched overlayer exceeds thin critical thickness direct-bandgap semiconductor yet produced can lattice-match silicon previously suggested structures pose formidable challenges synthesis much recent work therefore focused introducing compliant transition layers mismatched components- propose direct solution integrating silicon electronics optical components computationally designed two hypothetical direct-bandgap semiconductor alloys synthesis possible deposition specific group-iv precursor molecules lattice-match silicon -% along lattice planes low miller indices calculated bandgaps hence frequency emitted light lie window minimal absorption current optical fibres
