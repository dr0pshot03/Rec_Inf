signal transduction prion protein
cellular prion protein prpc glycosylphosphaltidylinositol-anchored cell-surface protein whose biological function unclear: used murine 1c11 neuronal differentiation model search prpc-dependent signal transduction antibody-mediated cross-linking caveolin--dependent coupling prpc tyrosine kinase fyn observed clathrin might also contribute coupling ability 1c11 cell line trigger prpc-dependent fyn activation restricted fully differentiated serotonergic noradrenergic progenies moreover signaling activity prpc occurred mainly neurites thus prpc may signal transduction protein
