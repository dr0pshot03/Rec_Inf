fas-fadd death domain complex structure unravels signalling receptor clustering
death inducing signalling complex disc formed fas receptor fadd fas associated death domain protein caspase pivotal trigger apoptosis- fas fadd disc represents receptor platform assembled initiates induction programmed cell death highly oligomeric network homotypic protein interactions comprised death domains fas fadd centre disc formation thus characterizing mechanistic basis fas fadd interaction crucial understanding disc signalling remained unclear largely lack structural data successfully formed isolated human fas fadd death domain complex report angstrom crystal structure complex shows tetrameric arrangement four fadd death domains bound four fas death domains show opening fas death domain exposes fadd binding site simultaneously generates fas fas bridge result regulatory fas fadd complex bridge governed weak protein protein interactions revealing model complex functions mechanistic switch switch prevents accidental disc assembly yet allows highly processive disc formation clustering upon sufficient stimulus addition depicting previously unknown mode death domain interactions results uncover mechanism receptor signalling solely oligomerization clustering events
