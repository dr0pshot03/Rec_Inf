drosophila stem cells share common requirement histone h2b ubiquitin protease scrawny
stem cells within diverse tissues share need chromatin configuration promotes self renewal yet chromatin proteins known regulate multiple types stem cells describe drosophila gene scrawny scny encoding ubiquitin specific protease required germline epithelial intestinal stem cells like yeast relative ubp10 scrawny deubiquitylates histone h2b functions gene silencing consistent previous studies conserved pathway chromatin regulation scny mutant cells elevated levels ubiquitinylated h2b trimethylated h3k4 findings suggest inhibiting h2b ubiquitylation scny represents common mechanism within stem cells used repress premature expression key differentiation genes including notch target genes
