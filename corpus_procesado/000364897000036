brain circuit synchronizes growth maturation revealed dilp8 binding lgr3
body-size constancy symmetry signs developmental stability yet unclear
exactly developing animals buffer size variation drosophila insulin-like peptide dilp8
responsive growth perturbations controls homeostatic mechanisms
coordinately adjust growth maturation maintain size within normal range
show lgr3 dilp8 receptor use functional adenosine
-monophosphate assays defined pair lgr3 neurons mediate homeostatic
regulation neurons extensive axonal arborizations genetic green
fluorescent protein reconstitution across synaptic partners show neurons
connect insulin-producing cells prothoracicotropic hormone-producing
neurons attenuate growth maturation previously unrecognized circuit suggests
growth maturation rate matched co-regulated according dilp8 signals
stabilize organismal size
