recovery 16s ribosomal rna gene fragments ancient halite
last decade sensitive techniques detecting dna successfully applied archaeological samples hundred thousand years old nevertheless still controversy doubt claims exceptionally ancient dna additional accounts stretching back nearly century suggest microorganisms may survive geological time evaporite deposits however often doubt age relationship evaporite formation incorporation microorganisms used petrographic geochemical techniques laser ablation microprobe-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry verify estimated geological age halite nacl evaporite samples fragments 16s ribosomal rna genes detected polymerase chain reaction amplification dna extracted halite samples ranging age myr millions years haloarchaeal 16s rdna amplicons present one sample myr whereas samples myr yielded bacterial 16s rdna amplicons terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analyses indicate complex different populations microorganisms free dna ancient halites different ages
