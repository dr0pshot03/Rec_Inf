prion propagation toxicity vivo occur two distinct mechanistic phases
mammalian prions cause fatal neurodegenerative conditions including creutzfeldt-jakob disease humans scrapie bovine spongiform encephalopathy animals prion infections typically associated remarkably prolonged highly consistent incubation periods followed rapid clinical phase relationship prion propagation generation neurotoxic species clinical onset remained obscure prion incubation periods experimental animals known vary inversely expression level cellular prion protein demonstrate prion propagation brain proceeds via two distinct phases: clinically silent exponential phase rate-limited prion protein concentration rapidly reaches maximal prion titre followed distinct switch plateau phase latter determines time clinical onset manner inversely proportional prion protein concentration findings demonstrate uncoupling infectivity toxicity suggest prions neurotoxic catalyse formation species prpc production neurotoxic species triggered prion propagation saturates leading switch autocatalytic production infectivity phase toxic phase pathway
