optical control electrons electron transfer 
dynamics electron transfer reactions solution can controlled use sequence femtosecond laser pulses charge transfer solvent ctts reaction sodide na- tetrahydrofuran initial light pulse launched ctts reaction ejecting electron either immediate solvent-separated na-o:solvated electron contact pair second pulse used excite electrons contact pairs third pulse monitored amount na produced back electron transfer excitation electrons immediate contact pairs shut back electron transfer whereas excitation electrons solvent-separated pairs enhanced hindered back electron transfer
