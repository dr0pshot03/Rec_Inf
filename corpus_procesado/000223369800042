snf acetylcholine transporter interacting dystrophin complex caenorhabditis elegans 
muscular dystrophies among common human genetic diseases characterized progressive muscle degeneration muscular dystrophies result genetic defects components dystrophin-glycoprotein complex dgc multimeric complex found muscle cell plasma membrane dgc links intracellular cytoskeleton extracellular matrix thought important maintaining mechanical integrity muscles organizing signalling molecules exact role dgc pathogenesis disease however remained uncertain mutations caenorhabditis elegans dgc genes lead specific defects coordinated movement can also cause muscle degeneration- show mutations gene snf result phenotypes indistinguishable dgc mutants snf encodes novel acetylcholine/choline transporter snf mediates uptake acetylcholine neuromuscular junctions periods increased synaptic activity snf also interacts dgc mutations dgc genes cause loss snf neuromuscular junctions improper clearing acetylcholine prolonged excitation muscles might contribute pathogenesis muscular dystrophies
