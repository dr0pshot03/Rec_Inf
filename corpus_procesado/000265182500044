inactivation fto gene protects obesity 
several independent genome-wide association studies identified strong correlation body mass index polymorphisms human fto gene- common variants first intron define risk allele predisposing obesity homozygotes risk allele weighing approximately kilograms homozygotes low risk allele nevertheless functional role fto energy homeostasis remains elusive show loss fto mice leads postnatal growth retardation significant reduction adipose tissue lean body mass leanness fto-deficient mice develops consequence increased energy expenditure systemic sympathetic activation despite decreased spontaneous locomotor activity relative hyperphagia taken together experiments provide knowledge first direct demonstration fto functionally involved energy homeostasis control energy expenditure
