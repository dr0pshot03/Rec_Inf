dynamical instability produces transform faults mid-ocean ridges 
transform faults mid-ocean ridges-one striking yet enigmatic features terrestrial plate tectonics-are considered inherited product preexisting fault structures ridge offsets along faults therefore remain constant time numerical models suggest transform faults actively developing result dynamical instability constructive plate boundaries irrespective previous structure boundary instability asymmetric plate growth can spontaneously start alternate directions along successive ridge sections resultant curved ridges become transform faults within million years fracture-related rheological weakening stabilizes ridge-parallel detachment faults offsets along transform faults change continuously time asymmetric plate growth discontinuously ridge jumps
