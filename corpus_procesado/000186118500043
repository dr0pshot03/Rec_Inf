independent rate temporal coding hippocampal pyramidal cells
brain hippocampal pyramidal cells use temporal well rate coding signal spatial aspects animals environment behaviour temporal code takes form phase relationship concurrent cycle hippocampal electroencephalogram theta rhythm two codes represent different variable however requires rate phase vary independently contrast recent suggestions tightly coupled reflecting amplitude cells input show time firing firing rate dissociable can represent two independent variables: respectively animals location within place field speed movement field independent encoding location together actions stimuli occurring may help explain dual roles hippocampus spatial episodic memory may indicate general role hippocampus relational/declarative memory
