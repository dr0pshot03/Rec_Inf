quantitative protein interaction network erbb receptors using protein microarrays
although epidermal growth factor receptor egfr also called erbb1 relatives initiate one well-studied signalling networks yet genome-wide view even earliest step pathway: recruitment proteins activated receptors use protein microarrays comprising virtually every src homology sh2 phosphotyrosine binding ptb domain encoded human genome measure equilibrium dissociation constant domain peptides representing physiological sites tyrosine phosphorylation four erbb receptors involved independent biochemical measurements provided quantitative protein interaction network reveals many new interactions including ones fall outside current view domain selectivity slicing network different affinity thresholds found surprising differences receptors notably egfr erbb2 become markedly promiscuous threshold lowered whereas erbb3 egfr erbb2 overexpressed many human cancers results suggest extent promiscuity changes protein concentration may contribute oncogenic potential receptor tyrosine kinases perhaps signalling proteins well
