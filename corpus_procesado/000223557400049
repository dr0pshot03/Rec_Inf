nobox deficiency disrupts early folliculogenesis oocyte-specific gene expression 
primordial ovarian follicles mice form somatic cells surround individual oocytes show lack nobox oocyte-specific homeobox gene accelerates postnatal oocyte loss abolishes transition primordial growing follicles mice follicles replaced fibrous tissue female mice lacking nobox manner similar nonsyndromic ovarian failure women genes preferentially expressed oocytes including oct4 gdf9 down-regulated nobox-/- mice whereas ubiquitous genes bmp4 kit bax remain unaffected therefore nobox critical specifying oocyte-restricted gene expression pattern essential postnatal follicle development
