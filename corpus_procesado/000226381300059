molecular dynamics cyclically contracting insect flight muscle vivo 
flight insects-which constitute largest group species animal kingdom-is powered specialized muscles located within thorax insects contraction triggered motor neuron spike mechanical stretch imposed antagonistic muscles whereas stretch activation reciprocal phenomenon shortening deactivation observed varying extents striated muscles particularly prominent indirect flight muscles insects show changes thick-filament structure actin-myosin interactions living flying drosophila use synchrotron small-angle x-ray diffraction elicit stable flight behaviour permit capture images specific phases within ms wingbeat cycle tethered flies within visual flight simulator recorded images mus duration every mus create eight-frame diffraction movie frame reflecting instantaneous structure contractile apparatus time-resolved measurements molecular-level structure provide new insight unique ability insect flight muscle generate elevated power high frequency
