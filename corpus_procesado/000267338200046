germline p granules liquid droplets localize controlled dissolution/condensation 
sexually reproducing organisms embryos specify germ cells ultimately generate sperm eggs caenorhabditis elegans first germ cell established rna protein-rich p granules localize posterior one-cell embryo localization p granules physical nature remain poorly understood show p granules exhibit liquid-like behaviors including fusion dripping wetting used estimate viscosity surface tension liquids p granules rapidly dissolved condensed localization occurred biased increase p granule condensation posterior process reflects classic phase transition polarity proteins vary condensation point across cell phase transitions may represent fundamental physicochemical mechanism structuring cytoplasm
