stretchable nanoparticle conductors self-organized conductive pathways
research stretchable conductors fuelled diverse technological needs flexible electronics neuroprosthetic cardiostimulating implants soft robotics curvilinear systems require materials high conductivity tensile strain per cent refs furthermore implantable devices stretchable displays need materials conductivities thousand times higher retaining strain per cent however molecular mechanisms operate material deformation stiffening make stretchability conductivity fundamentally difficult properties combine macroscale stretching solids elongates chemical bonds leading reduced overlap delocalization electronic orbitals conductivity-stretchability dilemma can exemplified liquid metals conduction pathways retained large deformation weak interatomic bonds lead compromised strength best-known stretchable conductors use polymer matrices containing percolated networks high-aspect-ratio nanometre-scale tubes nanowires address dilemma extent- improvements achieved using fillers conductive component increased aspect ratio all-metallic composition specific alignment way fillers arranged matrix however synthesis separation high-aspect-ratio fillers challenging stiffness increases volume content metallic filler anisotropy increases alignment pre-strained substrates buckled microwires three-dimensional microfluidic polymer networks also explored demonstrate stretchable conductors polyurethane containing spherical nanoparticles deposited either layer-by-layer assembly vacuum-assisted flocculation high conductivity stretchability observed composites despite minimal aspect ratio nanoparticles materials also demonstrate electronic tunability mechanical properties arise dynamic self-organization nanoparticles stress modified percolation theory incorporating self-assembly behaviour nanoparticles gave excellent match experimental data
