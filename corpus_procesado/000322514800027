stretchable nanoparticle conductors self-organized conductive pathways 
research stretchable conductors fuelled diverse technological needs flexible electronics neuroprosthetic cardiostimulating implants soft robotics curvilinear systems require materials high conductivity tensile strain per cent refs - furthermore implantable devices stretchable displays4 need materials conductivities thousand times higher retaining strain per cent however molecular mechanisms operate material deformation stiffening make stretchability conductivity fundamentally difficult properties combine macroscale stretching solids elongates chemical bonds leading reduced overlap delocalization electronic orbitals5 conductivity-stretchability dilemma can exemplified liquid metals conduction pathways retained large deformation weak interatomic bonds lead compromised strength best-known stretchable conductors use polymer matrices containing percolated networks high-aspect-ratio nanometre-scale tubes nanowires address dilemma extent6- improvements achieved using fillers conductive component increased aspect ratio all-metallic composition12 specific alignment way fillers arranged matrix1314 however synthesis separation high-aspect-ratio fillers challenging stiffness increases volume content metallic filler anisotropy increases alignment15 pre-strained substrates1617 buckled microwires18 three-dimensional microfluidic polymer networks19 also explored demonstrate stretchable conductors polyurethane containing spherical nanoparticles deposited either layer-by-layer assembly vacuum-assisted flocculation high conductivity stretchability observed composites despite minimal aspect ratio nanoparticles materials also demonstrate electronic tunability mechanical properties arise dynamic self-organization nanoparticles stress modified percolation theory incorporating self-assembly behaviour nanoparticles gave excellent match experimental data
