situ imaging silicalite- surface growth reveals mechanism crystallization 
growth mechanism silicalite- mfi zeolite juxtaposed classical models postulate silica molecules primary growth units nonclassical pathways based aggregation metastable silica nanoparticle precursors although experimental evidence gathered past two decades suggests precursor attachment dominant pathway direct validation hypothesis relative roles molecular precursor species remained elusive present situ study silicalite- crystallization characteristic synthesis conditions using time-resolved atomic force microscopy images observed silica precursor attachment crystal surfaces followed concomitant structural rearrangement three-dimensional growth accretion silica molecules confirm silicalite- growth occurs via addition silica molecules precursors bridging classical nonclassical mechanisms
