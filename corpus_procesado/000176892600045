adhesion friction mechanisms polymer-on-polymer surfaces 
adhesion friction smooth polymer surfaces studied glass transition temperature use surface forces apparatus friction force crosslinked polymer orders magnitude less uncrosslinked polymer contrast chain scission outermost layers adhesion hysteresis friction forces increase substantially results show polymer-polymer adhesion hysteresis friction depend dynamic rearrangement outermost polymer segments shearing interfaces increase transition made crosslinked surfaces surfaces long chains surfaces quasi-free ends results suggest new ways manipulating adhesion friction polymer surfaces adjusting state surface chains
