kinase-regulated quantal assemblies kiss-and-run recycling caveolae
functional genomics approach revealed caveolae/raft-mediated endocytosis subject regulation large number kinases explore role kinases caveolae dynamics discover caveolae operate using principles different classical membrane trafficking first caveolar coat contains set number one quantum caveolin molecules second caveolae either stored stationary multi-caveolar structures plasma membrane undergo continuous cycles fission fusion plasma membrane small volume beneath surface without disassembling caveolar coat third switch mechanism shifts caveolae localized cycle long-range cytoplasmic transport identified six kinases regulate different steps caveolar cycle observations reveal new principles caveolae trafficking suggest dynamic properties caveolae transport competence regulated different kinases operating several levels
