quantum fluctuations create intermolecular forces pervade macroscopic bodies1- molecular separations nanometres less interactions familiar van der waals forces4 however recognized theories casimir polder lifshitz5- larger distances macroscopic condensed media reveal retardation effects associated finite speed light although long range forces exist within matter attractive interactions far measured material bodies8- show experimentally accord theoretical prediction12 sign force can changed attractive repulsive suitable choice interacting materials immersed fluid measured repulsive interaction found weaker attractive however cases magnitude force increases decreasing surface separation repulsive casimir lifshitz forces allow quantum levitation objects fluid lead new class switchable nanoscale devices ultra-low static friction13-
