measured long-range repulsive casimir-lifshitz forces 
quantum fluctuations create intermolecular forces pervade macroscopic bodies- molecular separations nanometres less interactions familiar van der waals forces however recognized theories casimir polder lifshitz- larger distances macroscopic condensed media reveal retardation effects associated finite speed light although long range forces exist within matter attractive interactions far measured material bodies- show experimentally accord theoretical prediction sign force can changed attractive repulsive suitable choice interacting materials immersed fluid measured repulsive interaction found weaker attractive however cases magnitude force increases decreasing surface separation repulsive casimir lifshitz forces allow quantum levitation objects fluid lead new class switchable nanoscale devices ultra-low static friction-
