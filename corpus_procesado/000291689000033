o-glycosylated cell wall proteins essential root hair growth 
root hairs single cells develop tip growth specialized absorption nutrients cell walls composed polysaccharides hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins hrgps include extensins exts arabinogalactan-proteins agps proline hydroxylation early posttranslational modification hrgps catalyzed prolyl hydroxylases p4hs defines subsequent o-glycosylation sites exts mainly arabinosylated agps mainly arabinogalactosylated explored biological function p4hs arabinosyltransferases exts root hair cell growth biochemical inhibition genetic disruption resulted blockage polarized growth root hairs reduced arabinosylation exts results demonstrate correct o-glycosylation exts essential cell-wall self-assembly hence root hair elongation arabidopsis thaliana
