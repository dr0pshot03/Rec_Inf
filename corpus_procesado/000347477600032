high-value alcohols higher-oxidation-state compounds catalytic z-selective cross-metathesis 
olefin metathesis catalysts provide access molecules indispensable physicians researchers life sciences persisting problem however dearth chemical transformations directly generate acyclic z allylic alcohols including products contain hindered neighbouring substituent reactive functional units phenol aldehyde carboxylic acid present electronically modified ruthenium-disulfide catalyst effective generating high-value compounds cross-metathesis ruthenium complex prepared commercially available precursor easily generated air-stable zinc catechothiolate transformations typically proceed mole per cent complex inexpensive reaction partner hours ambient conditions products obtained per cent yield : z:e diastereoselectivity use catalyst demonstrated synthesis naturally occurring anti-tumour agent neopeltolide single-step stereoselective gram-scale conversion renewable feedstock oleic acid anti-fungal agent conversion new catalyst promotes cross-metathesis efficiently commonly used dichloro-ruthenium complexes indicating utility may extend beyond z-selective processes
