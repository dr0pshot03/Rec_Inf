massively parallel single-cell rna-seq marker-free decomposition tissues cell types 
multicellular organisms biological function emerges heterogeneous cell types form complex organs nevertheless dissection tissues mixtures cellular subpopulations currently challenging introduce automated massively parallel single-cell rna sequencing rna-seq approach analyzing vivo transcriptional states thousands single cells combined unsupervised classification algorithms facilitates ab initio cell-type characterization splenic tissues modeling single-cell transcriptional states dendritic cells additional hematopoietic cell types uncovers rich cell-type heterogeneity gene-modules activity steady state pathogen activation cellular diversity thereby approached inference variable dynamic pathway activity rather fixed preprogrammed cell-type hierarchy data demonstrate single-cell rna-seq effective tool comprehensive cellular decomposition complex tissues
