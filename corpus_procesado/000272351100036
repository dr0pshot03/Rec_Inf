elusive twelfth vibrational state beryllium dimer 
beryllium dimer puzzled chemists roughly years account unexpectedly strong bonding interaction two nominally closed-shell atoms recent spectroscopic measurements characterized molecules ground electronic state sufficient resolution distinguish vibrational levels possibility twelfth level lay just dissociation threshold remained unresolved present potential function based ab initio calculations full configuration interaction level definitively supports presence twelfth vibrational state morphed versions potential fitted experimental data closely reproduce observed spectra within cm- bolstering strength assignment
