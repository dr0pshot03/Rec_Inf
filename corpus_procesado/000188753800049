probing two-electron dynamics atom 
coherent short-pulse laser excitation used control approximate energy relative proximity two valence electrons within alkaline-earth atom thereby providing insight dynamical evolution three-body coulomb system time-domain experiments enable direct experimental study electron dynamics classical limit two-electron atom example look mechanism autoionization one two-electron configuration class find doubly excited atom decays single violent electron-electron collision rather gradual exchange energy electrons
