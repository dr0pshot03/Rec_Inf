phylogeny ants: diversification age angiosperms
present large-scale molecular phylogeny ants hymenoptera: formicidae based kilobases sequence data six gene regions extracted described extant genera representing subfamilies two subfamilies recovered monophyletic divergence time estimates calibrated minimum age constraints fossils indicate subfamilies representing extant ants arose much earlier previously proposed began diversify late cretaceous early eocene period also witnessed rise angiosperms herbivorous insects
