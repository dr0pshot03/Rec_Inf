cryptic genetic variation promotes rapid evolutionary adaptation rna enzyme
cryptic variation caused robustness phenotypes mutations cryptic variation effect phenotypes given genetic environmental background can effects mutations environmental change- evolutionary adaptation natural selection requires phenotypic variation phenotypically revealed cryptic genetic variation may facilitate evolutionary adaptation- possible cryptic variation happens pre-adapted exapted new environment thus advantageous revealed however facilitating role cryptic variation proven partly pertinent work focuses complex phenotypes whole organisms whose genetic basis incompletely understood show populations rna enzymes accumulated cryptic variation adapt rapidly new substrate population without cryptic variation detailed analysis evolving rna populations genotype space shows cryptic variation allows population explore new genotypes become adaptive new environment observations show cryptic variation contains new genotypes pre-adapted changed environment results highlight positive role robustness epistasis can adaptive evolution
