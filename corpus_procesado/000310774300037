principles designing ideal protein structures
unlike random heteropolymers natural proteins fold unique ordered structures understanding encoded amino-acid sequences complicated energetically unfavourable non-ideal features-for example kinked alpha-helices bulged beta-strands strained loops buried polar groups-that arise proteins evolutionary selection biological function neutral drift describe approach designing ideal protein structures stabilized completely consistent local non-local interactions approach based set rules relating secondary structure patterns protein tertiary motifs make possible design funnel-shaped protein folding energy landscapes leading target folded state guided rules designed sequences predicted fold ideal protein structures consisting alpha-helices beta-strands minimal loops designs five different topologies found monomeric stable adopt structures solution nearly identical computational models results illuminate folding funnels natural proteins arise provide foundation engineering new generation functional proteins free natural evolution
