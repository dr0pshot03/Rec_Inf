supershear transition mechanism cracks
seismic data indicate fault ruptures follow complicated paths variable velocity inhomogeneities initial stress fracture energy report phenomenon unique three-dimensional cracks: locally stronger fault sections rather slowing ruptures drive forward velocities exceeding shear wave speed supershear mechanism differentiates barrier asperity models fault heterogeneity previously regarded indistinguishable high strength barriers concentrate energy producing potentially destructive pulses strong ground motion
