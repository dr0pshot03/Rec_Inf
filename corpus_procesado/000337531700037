controlling low rates cell differentiation noise ultrahigh feedback 
mammalian tissue size maintained slow replacement de-differentiating dying cells adipocytes key regulators glucose lipid metabolism renewal rate % per year used computational modeling quantitative mass spectrometry single-cell microscopy show cell-to-cell variability noise protein abundance acts within network six positive feedbacks permit pre-adipocytes differentiate low rates reconciles two fundamental opposing requirements: high cell-to-cell signal variability needed generate low differentiation rates whereas low signal variability needed prevent differentiated cells de-differentiating higher eukaryotes can thus control low rates near irreversible cell fate decisions balancing act noise ultrahigh feedback connectivity
