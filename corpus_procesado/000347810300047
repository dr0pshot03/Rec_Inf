neural representation taste quality periphery
mammalian taste system responsible sensing responding five basic taste qualities: sweet sour bitter salty umami previously showed taste detected dedicated taste receptor cells trcs tongue palate epithelium understand trcs transmit information higher neural centres examined tuning properties large ensembles neurons first neural station gustatory system generated characterized collection transgenic mice expressing genetically encoded calcium indicator central peripheral neurons used gradient refractive index microendoscope combined high-resolution two-photon microscopy image taste responses ganglion neurons buried deep base brain results reveal fine selectivity taste preference ganglion neurons demonstrate strong match trcs tongue principal neural afferents relaying taste information brain expose highly specific transfer taste information taste cells central nervous system
