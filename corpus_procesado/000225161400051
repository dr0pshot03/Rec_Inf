metal wires terahertz wave guiding
sources systems far-infrared terahertz thz hz radiation received extensive attention recent years applications sensing imaging spectroscopy- terahertz radiation bridges gap microwave optical regimes offers significant scientific technological potential many fields however waveguiding intermediate spectral region still remains challenge neither conventional metal waveguides microwave radiation dielectric fibres visible near-infrared radiation can used guide terahertz waves long distance owing high loss finite conductivity metals high absorption coefficient dielectric materials spectral range furthermore extensive use broadband pulses terahertz regime imposes additional constraint low dispersion necessary compatibility spectroscopic applications show simple waveguide namely bare metal wire can used transport terahertz pulses virtually dispersion low attenuation remarkable structural simplicity example new waveguiding structure demonstrate endoscope terahertz pulses
