backtracking single rna polymerase molecules observed near-base-pair resolution 
escherichia coli rna polymerase rnap synthesizes rna remarkable fidelity vivo1 low error rate may achieved means proofreading mechanism comprised two sequential events first event backtracking involves transcriptionally upstream motion rnap several base pairs carries end nascent rna transcript away enzyme active site second event endonucleolytic cleavage occurs variable delay results scission release recently incorporated ribonucleotides freeing active site combining ultrastable optical trapping apparatus novel two bead assay monitor transcriptional elongation near base pair precision observed backtracking recovery single molecules rnap backtracking events similar bp occurred infrequently locations throughout dna template associated pauses lasting s > min inosine triphosphate increased frequency backtracking pauses whereas accessory proteins grea greb stimulate cleavage nascent rna decreased duration pauses
