blocking vegfr suppresses angiogenic sprouting vascular network formation
angiogenesis growth new blood vessels pre existing vasculature key process several pathological conditions including tumour growth age related macular degeneration vascular endothelial growth factors vegfs stimulate angiogenesis lymphangiogenesis activating vegf receptor vegfr tyrosine kinases endothelial cells vegfr also known flt present endothelia development adult becomes restricted lymphatic endothelium however vegfr upregulated microvasculature tumours wounds demonstrate vegfr highly expressed angiogenic sprouts genetic targeting vegfr blocking vegfr signalling monoclonal antibodies results decreased sprouting vascular density vessel branching endothelial cell proliferation mouse angiogenesis models stimulation vegfr augmented vegf induced angiogenesis sustained angiogenesis even presence vegfr also known kdr flk inhibitors whereas antibodies vegfr vegfr combination resulted additive inhibition angiogenesis tumour growth furthermore genetic pharmacological disruption notch signalling pathway led widespread endothelial vegfr expression excessive sprouting inhibited blocking vegfr signals results implicate vegfr regulator vascular network formation targeting vegfr may provide additional efficacy anti angiogenic therapies especially towards vessels resistant vegf vegfr inhibitors
