overcoming limitations directed c-h functionalizations heterocycles 
directed c-h activation reactions nitrogen sulphur atoms present heterocyclic substrates will coordinate strongly metal catalysts coordination can lead catalyst poisoning c-h functionalization undesired position limits application c-h activation reactions heterocycle-based drug discovery- regard attracted much interest pharmaceutical companies- report robust synthetically useful method overcomes complications associated performing c-h functionalization reactions heterocycles approach employs simple n-methoxy amide group serves directing group anionic ligand promotes situ generation reactive pdx2 x arconome species pd source using air sole oxidant way pdx2 species localized near target c-h bond avoiding interference nitrogen sulphur atoms present heterocyclic substrates reaction overrides conventional positional selectivity patterns observed substrates containing strongly coordinating heteroatoms including nitrogen sulphur phosphorus thus operationally simple aerobic reaction demonstrates possible bypass fundamental limitation long plagued applications directed c-h activation medicinal chemistry
