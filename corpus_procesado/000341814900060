optimization lag time underlies antibiotic tolerance evolved bacterial populations 
great therapeutic achievements antibiotics dramatically undercut evolution bacterial strategies overcome antibiotic stress12 strategies fall two classes resistance makes possible microorganism grow constant presence antibiotic provided concentration antibiotic high tolerance allows microorganism survive antibiotic treatment even high antibiotic concentrations long duration treatment limited although resistance tolerance important reasons failure antibiotic treatments3- evolution resistance7- much better understood tolerance followed evolution bacterial populations intermittent exposure high concentrations antibiotics used clinic characterized evolved strains terms resistance tolerance found strains adapted specific genetic mutations became fixed evolved populations monitoring phenotypic changes population single-cell levels found first adaptive change antibiotic stress development tolerance major adjustment single-cell lag-time distribution without change resistance strikingly found lag time bacteria regrowth optimized match duration antibiotic-exposure interval whole genome sequencing evolved strains restoration wild-type alleles allowed us identify target genes involved antibiotic-driven phenotype: tolerance lag tbl better understanding lag-time evolution key determinant survival bacterial populations high antibiotic concentrations lead new approaches impeding evolution antibiotic resistance
