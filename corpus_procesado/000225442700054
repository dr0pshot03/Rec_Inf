probing electronic transitions individual carbon nanotubes rayleigh scattering
rayleigh scattering spectra obtained individual single-waited carbon nanotubes use laser-generated visible near-infrared supercontinuum diagnostic method noninvasive general nanoscale objects approach permits clear identification excited states arbitrary metallic semiconducting nanotubes analyzed spectral lineshapes relation role excitonic effects correlated results raman scattering data individual tubes nanotube structure remained distances tens micrometers small nanotube bundles retained distinct rayleigh spectroscopic signatures component nanotubes thus allowing probing nanotube-nanotube interactions
