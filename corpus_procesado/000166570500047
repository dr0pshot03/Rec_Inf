testing hamiltons rule competition relatives
hamiltons theory kin selection suggests individuals show less aggression altruism towards closer kin recent theoretical work however suggested competition relatives can counteract kin selection altruism- unfortunately factors tend increase average relatedness interacting individuals-such limited dispersal-also tend increase amount competition relatives therefore natural systems conflicting influences increased competition increased relatedness confounded limiting attempts test theory- fig wasp taxa exhibit varying levels aggression among non-dispersing males show range average relatedness levels thus across species effects relatedness competition relatives can separated report that-contrary hamiltons original prediction agreement recent theory- level fighting males shows correlation estimated relatedness interacting males negatively correlated future mating opportunities
