structural basis essential subunit interaction influenza virus rna polymerase
influenza virus major human animal pathogen potential cause catastrophic loss life virus reproduces rapidly mutates frequently occasionally crosses species barriers recent emergence asia avian influenza related highly pathogenic forms human virus highlighted urgent need new effective treatments demonstrate importance viral replication subunit interface viral rna polymerase thereby providing new set potential drug binding sites entirely independent surface antigen type current medication targets heterotrimeric polymerase complex three subunits pb1 pb2 pa required transcription replication- pb1 carries polymerase active site pb2 includes capped rna recognition domain pa involved assembly functional complex- far little structural information reported them- describe crystal structure large fragment one subunit pa influenza rna polymerase bound fragment another subunit pb1 carboxy terminal domain pa forms novel fold forms deep highly hydrophobic groove amino terminal residues pb1 can fit forming helix
