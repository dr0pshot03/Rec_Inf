genome-wide association study phenotypes arabidopsis thaliana inbred lines
although pioneered human geneticists potential solution challenging problem finding genetic basis common human diseases genome-wide association gwa studies owing advances genotyping sequencing technology become obvious general approach studying genetics natural variation traits agricultural importance particularly useful inbred lines available lines genotyped can phenotyped multiple times making possible well extremely cost effective study many different traits many different environments replicating phenotypic measurements reduce environmental noise demonstrate power approach carrying gwa study phenotypes arabidopsis thaliana widely distributed predominantly self-fertilizing model plant known harbour considerable genetic variation many adaptively important traits results dramatically different human gwa studies identify many common alleles major effect also many cases harder interpret confounding complex genetics population structure make difficult distinguish true associations false however a-priori candidates significantly over-represented among associations well making many excellent candidates follow-up experiments study demonstrates feasibility gwa studies thaliana suggests approach will appropriate many organisms
