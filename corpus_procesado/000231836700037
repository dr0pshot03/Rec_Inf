conversion zinc oxide nanobelts superlattice-structured nanohelices
previously unknown rigid helical structure zinc oxide consisting superlattice-structured nanobelt formed spontaneously vapor-solid growth process starting single-crystal stiff nanoribbon dominated c-plane polar surfaces abrupt structural transformation superlattice-structured nanobelt led formation uniform nanohelix due rigid lattice rotation twisting nanohelix made two types alternating periodically distributed long crystal stripes oriented c axes perpendicular nanohelix terminated transforming single-crystal nanobelt dominated nonpolar bar0 surfaces nanohelix manipulated elastic properties measured suggests possible uses electromechanically coupled sensors transducers resonators
