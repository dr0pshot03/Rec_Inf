regulation b lymphocyte macrophage development graded expression pu1 
ets family transcription factor pu1 required development multiple lineages immune system using retroviral transduction pu1 complementary dna mutant hematopoietic progenitors demonstrate differing concentrations protein regulate development b lymphocytes compared macrophages low concentration pu1 protein induces b cell fate whereas high concentration promotes macrophage differentiation blocks b cell development conversely transcriptionally weakened mutant protein preferentially induces b cell generation results suggest graded expression transcription factor can used specify distinct cell fates hematopoietic system
