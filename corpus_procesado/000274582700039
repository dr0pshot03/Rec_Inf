change optical polarization associated gamma-ray flare blazar 3c 
widely accepted strong variable radiation detected accessible energy bands number active galaxies arises relativistic doppler-boosted jet pointing close line sight1 size emitting zone location region relative central supermassive black hole however poorly known estimates ranging light-hours light-year report coincidence gamma gamma-ray flare dramatic change optical polarization angle provides evidence co-spatiality optical gamma-ray emission regions indicates highly ordered jet magnetic field results also require non-axisymmetric structure emission zone implying curved trajectory emitting material within jet dissipation region located considerable distance black hole gravitational radii
