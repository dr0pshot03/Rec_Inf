test unified neutral theory biodiversity 
one fundamental questions ecology controls biodiversity recent theory suggests biodiversity controlled predominantly neutral drift species abundances1- theory generated considerable controversy5- claims many mechanisms long studied ecologists niches little involvement structuring communities theory predicts species abundance distribution within community follow zero-sum multinomial distribution zsm far rigorously tested specifically remains shown zsm fits data significantly better reasonable null models test whether zsm fits several empirical data sets better lognormal distribution zsm fail fit empirical data better lognormal distribution % time also fails fit empirical data better even majority time means evidence zsm predicts abundances better much parsimonious null hypothesis
