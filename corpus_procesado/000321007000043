mechanism eukaryotic rna polymerase iii transcription termination 
gene expression organisms involves many factors tightly controlled although much known initial phase transcription rna polymerase iii pol iii enzyme synthesizes majority rna molecules eukaryotic cells termination poorly understood show extensive structure pol iii-synthesized transcripts dictates release elongation complexes end genes poly-t termination signal cause termination causes catalytic inactivation backtracking pol iii thus committing enzyme termination transporting nearest rna secondary structure facilitates pol iii release similarity termination mechanisms pol iii bacterial rna polymerase suggests hairpin-dependent termination may date back common ancestor multisubunit rna polymerases
