orchestrating size shape morphogenesis
living organisms exhibit tremendous diversity evident large repertoire forms considerable size range scientists discovered conserved mechanisms control development organisms drosophila proved particularly powerful model system identify signalling pathways organize tissue patterns recently much learned control tissue growth tissue shape coordination cellular tissue levels new models integrate specific signals mechanical forces shape tissues may also control size
