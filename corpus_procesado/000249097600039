detection carbonation drosophila gustatory system 
five known taste modalities humans: sweet bitter sour salty umami taste monosodium glutamate although fruitfly drosophila melanogaster tastes sugars salts noxious chemicals nature number taste modalities organism clear previous studies identified one taste cell population marked gustatory receptor gene gr5a detects sugars second population marked gr66a detects bitter compounds- identify novel taste modality insect: taste carbonated water use combination anatomical calcium imaging behavioural approaches identify population taste neurons detects co2 mediates taste acceptance behaviour taste carbonation may allow drosophila detect obtain nutrients growing microorganisms whereas co2 detection olfactory system mediates avoidance co2 detection gustatory system mediates acceptance behaviour demonstrating context co2 determines appropriate behaviour work opens possibility taste carbonation may also exist organisms
