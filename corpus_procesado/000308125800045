cucumber tendril coils overwinds
helical coiling plant tendrils fascinated scientists centuries yet underlying mechanism remains elusive moreover despite darwins widely accepted interpretation coiled tendrils soft springs mechanical behavior remains unknown experiments cucumber tendrils demonstrate tendril coiling occurs via asymmetric contraction internal fiber ribbon specialized cells tension extracted fiber ribbons old tendrils exhibit twistless overwinding rather unwinding initially soft response followed strong strain-stiffening large extensions explain behavior using physical models prestrained rubber strips geometric arguments mathematical models elastic filaments collectively study illuminates origin tendril coiling quantifies darwins original proposal suggests designs biomimetic twistless springs tunable mechanical responses
