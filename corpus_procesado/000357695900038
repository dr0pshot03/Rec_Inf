hypoxia fate mapping identifies cycling cardiomyocytes adult heart 
although adult mammalian heart incapable meaningful functional recovery following substantial cardiomyocyte loss now clear modest cardiomyocyte turnover occurs adult mouse human hearts mediated primarily proliferation pre-existing cardiomyocytes- however fate mapping cycling cardiomyocytes possible thus far owing lack identifiable genetic markers several organs stem progenitor cells reside relatively hypoxic microenvironments stabilization hypoxia-inducible factor alpha hif alpha subunit critical maintenance function- report fate mapping hypoxic cells progenies generating transgenic mouse expressing chimaeric protein oxygen-dependent degradation odd domain hif alpha fused tamoxifen-inducible creert2 recombinase mice bearing creert2-odd transgene driven either ubiquitous cag promoter cardiomyocyte-specific myosin heavy chain promoter identify rare population hypoxic cardiomyocytes display characteristics proliferative neonatal cardiomyocytes smaller size mononucleation lower oxidative dna damage notably hypoxic cardiomyocytes contributed widely new cardiomyocyte formation adult heart results indicate hypoxia signalling important hallmark cycling cardiomyocytes suggest hypoxia fate mapping can powerful tool identifying cycling cells adult mammals
