antibiotic interactions select resistance
multidrug combinations increasingly important combating spread antibiotic-resistance bacterial pathogens- broader scale combinations also important understanding microbial ecology evolution although effects multidrug combinations bacterial growth studied extensively relatively little known impact differential selection sensitive resistant bacterial populations normally presence drug confers advantage resistant mutants incompetition sensitive wild-type population show using direct competition assay doxycycline-resistant doxycycline-sensitive escherichia coli differential selection can inverted hyper-antagonistic class drug combinations used combination drug can render combined treatment selective drugs resistance allele inversion selection seems largely insensitive underlying resistance mechanism occurs sublethal concentrations maintaining inhibition wild type seemingly paradoxical results can rationalized terms simple geometric argument findings demonstrate previously unappreciated feature fitness landscape evolution resistance point trade-off effect drug interactions absolute potency relative competitive selection impose emerging resistant populations
