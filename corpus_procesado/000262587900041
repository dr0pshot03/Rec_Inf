genetic interactions transcription factors cause natural variation yeast
understanding genetic basis phenotypic diversity limited paucity examples multiple interacting loci identified show natural variation efficiency sporulation program yeast initiates sexual phase life cycle oak tree vineyard strains due allelic variation four nucleotide changes three transcription factors: ime1 rme1 rsf1 furthermore identified selection shaped quantitative variation yeast sporulation strains results illustrate genetic interactions transcription factors major source phenotypic diversity within species
