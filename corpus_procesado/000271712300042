mutations two independent pathways sufficient create hermaphroditic nematodes
although nematode caenorhabditis elegans produces self-fertile hermaphrodites descended male/female species hermaphroditism provides model origin novel traits related species c remanei male female sexes lowering activity tra rna interference created xx animals made spermatids well oocytes spermatids activate without addition male seminal fluid however lowering expression tra swm- gene regulates sperm activation c elegans produced xx animals active sperm self-fertile thus evolution hermaphroditism caenorhabditis probably required two steps: mutation sex-determination pathway caused xx spermatogenesis mutation allowed spermatids self-activate
