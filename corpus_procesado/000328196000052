progressive specification rather intercalation segments limb regeneration
amputated salamander limb regenerates correct number segments models explaining limb regeneration largely distinct limb development despite presence common patterning molecules intercalation important concept explain salamander limb regeneration clear evidence supporting refuting model lacking intercalation model first blastema cells acquire fingertip identity creating gap positional identity triggers regeneration intervening region stump used hoxa protein analysis transplantation assays show axolotl limb blastema cells acquire positional identity proximal-to-distal sequence therefore intercalation primary mechanism segment formation limb regeneration animal patterning development regeneration uses similar mechanisms
