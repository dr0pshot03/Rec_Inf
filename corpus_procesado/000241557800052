molecular phylogeny evolution morphology social amoebas 
social amoebas dictyostelia display conditional multicellularity wide variety forms despite widespread interest dictyostelium discoideum model system almost molecular data exist rest group constructed first molecular phylogeny dictyostelia parallel small subunit ribosomal rna alpha-tubulin data sets found dictyostelid taxonomy requires complete revision mapping characters onto phylogeny shows dominant trend dictyostelid evolution increased size cell type specialization fruiting structures complex morphologies evolving several times independently thus latter may controlled genes making underlying mechanisms relatively easy unravel
