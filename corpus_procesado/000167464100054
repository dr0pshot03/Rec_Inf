bri1 critical component plasma-membrane receptor plant steroids 
multicellular organisms use steroids signalling molecules physiological developmental regulation two different modes steroid action described animal systems: well-studied gene regulation response mediated nuclear receptors rapid non-genomic responses mediated proposed membrane-bound receptors plant genomes seem encode members nuclear receptor superfamily however transmembrane receptor kinase brassinosteroid-insensitive1 bri1 implicated brassinosteroid-responses show bri1 functions receptor brassinolide active brassinosteroid number brassinolide-binding sites degree response brassinolide depend level bri1 protein brassinolide-binding activity co-immunoprecipitates bri1 requires functional bri1 extracellular domain moreover treatment arabidopsis seedlings brassinolide induces autophosphorylation bri1 together binding studies shows bri1 receptor kinase transduces steroid signals across plasma membrane
