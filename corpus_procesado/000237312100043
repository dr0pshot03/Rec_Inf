cyclopropenylidenes: interstellar space isolated derivative laboratory 
like many molecular species detected interstellar medium singlet carbene cyclopropenylidene c3h2 presumed unstable isolate laboratory however appending pi-electron-donating amino groups triangular skeleton prepared cyclopropenylidene derivative stable room temperature contrast previously isolated carbenes compound require heteroatom adjacent electron-deficient carbon confer stability despite presence amino groups geometric parameters cyclic skeleton revealed x-ray crystallography slightly perturbed relative calculated structure unsubstituted cyclopropenylidene stable cyclopropenylidene derivatives might thus serve models better understanding formation carbon-bearing molecules interstellar medium
