nonindependence mammalian dental characters 
studies mammalian evolution frequently use data derived dentition1- dental characters particularly central inferring phylogenetic relationships fossil taxa1- teeth often recovered part use different aspects dental morphology phylogenetic signals implies independence dental characters report however least developmentally dental characters may nonindependent investigated three different levels cell signalling protein ectodysplasin eda5 changed dental characters mouse found increasing expression levels one gene number cusps increases cusp shapes positions change longitudinal crests form number teeth increases consistent modification characters related lateral placement cusps can traced small difference formation early signalling centre onset tooth crown formation results suggest aspects tooth shape developmental potential correlated changes evolution may taken account obscure phylogenetic history
