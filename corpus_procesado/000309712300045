adhesion functions cell sorting mechanically coupling cortices adhering cells
differential cell adhesion cortex tension thought drive cell sorting controlling cell-cell contact formation show cell adhesion cortex tension different mechanical functions controlling progenitor cell-cell contact formation sorting zebrafish gastrulation cortex tension controls cell-cell contact expansion modulating interfacial tension contact contrast adhesion little direct function contact expansion instead needed mechanically couple cortices adhering cells contacts allowing cortex tension control contact expansion coupling function adhesion mediated e-cadherin limited mechanical anchoring e-cadherin cortex thus cell adhesion provides mechanical scaffold cell cortex tension drive cell sorting gastrulation
