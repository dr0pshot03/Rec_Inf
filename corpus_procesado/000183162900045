environmental contaminants affect wide variety biological events many species dioxins typical environmental contaminants exert adverse oestrogen-related effects1 although anti-oestrogenic actions23 well described dioxins can also induce endometriosis4- oestrogen-dependent tumours89 implying possible oestrogenic effects however molecular mechanism underlying oestrogen-related actions dioxins remains largely unknown heterodimer dioxin receptor ahr arnt basic helix-loop-helix/pas-family transcription factors mediates toxic effects dioxins1011 show agonist-activated ahr/arnt heterodimer directly associates oestrogen receptors er-alpha er-beta association results recruitment unliganded er co-activator p300 oestrogen-responsive gene promoters leading activation transcription oestrogenic effects function liganded er attenuated oestrogenic actions ahr agonists detected wild-type ovariectomized mouse uteri absent ahr-/- er-alpha-/- ovariectomized mice findings suggest novel mechanism er-mediated oestrogen signalling modulated co-regulatory-like function activated ahr/arnt giving rise adverse oestrogen-related actions dioxin-type environmental contaminants
