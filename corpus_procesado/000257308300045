extinction risk depends strongly factors contributing stochasticity 
extinction risk natural populations depends stochastic factors affect individuals estimated incorporating factors stochastic models- stochasticity can divided four categories include probabilistic nature birth death level individuals demographic stochasticity variation population level birth death rates among times locations environmental stochasticity sex individuals variation vital rates among individuals within population demographic heterogeneity mechanistic stochastic models include factors previously developed examine combined effects extinction risk derive family stochastic ricker models using different combinations stochastic factors show extinction risk depends strongly combination factors contribute stochasticity furthermore show full stochastic model can relative importance environmental demographic variability therefore extinction risk correctly determined using full model find demographic sources stochasticity prominent cause variability laboratory population tribolium castaneum red flour beetle whereas using standard simpler models lead erroneous conclusion environmental variability dominates results demonstrate current estimates extinction risk natural populations greatly underestimated variability mistakenly attributed environment rather demographic factors described entail much higher extinction risk variability level
