on-chip natural assembly silicon photonic bandgap crystals
photonic bandgap crystals can reflect light direction propagation specific wavelength ranges- property can used confine manipulate guide photons allow creation all-optical integrated circuits achieve goal conventional semiconductor nanofabrication techniques adapted make photonic crystals- potentially simpler cheaper approach creating three-dimensional periodic structures natural assembly colloidal microspheres- however approach yields irregular polycrystalline photonic crystals difficult incorporate device importantly leads many structural defects can destroy photonic bandgap show assembling thin layer colloidal spheres silicon substrate can obtain planar single-crystalline silicon photonic crystals defect densities sufficiently low bandgap survives expected theory observe unity reflectance two crystalline directions photonic crystals around wavelength micrometres also show additional fabrication steps intentional doping patterning can performed demonstrating potential specific device applications
