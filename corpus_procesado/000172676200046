evidence evolution multiple genomes arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi
ancient asexuals directly contradict evolutionary theories explain organisms evolve sexual life history mutualistic arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi thought asexual approximately million years absence sex highly divergent descendants formerly allelic nucleotide sequences thought evolve genome mycorrhizal fungi individual offspring receive hundreds nuclei parent hypothesized population genetically different nuclei evolve within one individual use dna-dna fluorescent situ hybridization show genetically different nuclei co-exist individual arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi also show population genetics techniques used organisms unsuitable detecting recombination assumptions underlying processes rt fungal genomic structure shown instead used phylogenetic approach show within-individual genetic variation occurs arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi probably evolved accumulation mutations essentially clonal genome infrequent recombination events conclude mycorrhizal fungi evolved multi-genomic
