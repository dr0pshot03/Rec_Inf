protein trisulfide couples dissimilatory sulfate reduction energy conservation
microbial sulfate reduction governed earths biogeochemical sulfur cycle least billion years however enzymatic mechanisms behind pathway incompletely understood particularly reduction sulfite-a key intermediate pathway critical reaction performed dsrab widespread enzyme also involved dissimilatory sulfur metabolisms using vitro assays archaeal dsrab supported genetic experiments bacterial system show product sulfite reduction dsrab protein-based trisulfide sulfite-derived sulfur bridging two conserved cysteines dsrc physiological studies also reveal sulfate reduction rates determined cellular levels dsrc dissimilatory sulfate reduction couples four-electron reduction dsrc trisulfide energy conservation
