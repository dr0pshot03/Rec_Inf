dna methylation one best-characterized epigenetic modifications1- although enzymes catalyse dna methylation characterized enzymes responsible demethylation elusive5 recent study indicates human tet1 protein catalyse conversion -methylcytosine 5mc dna -hydroxymethylcytosine 5hmc raising possibility dna demethylation may tet1-mediated process6 extend study demonstrating three mouse tet proteins tet1 tet2 tet3 can also catalyse similar reaction tet1 important role mouse embryonic stem es cell maintenance maintaining expression nanog es cells downregulation nanog via tet1 knockdown correlates methylation nanog promoter supporting role tet1 regulating dna methylation status furthermore knockdown tet1 pre-implantation embryos results bias towards trophectoderm differentiation thus studies uncover enzymatic activity tet proteins also demonstrate role tet1 es cell maintenance inner cell mass cell specification
