micro-engineered local field control high-sensitivity multispectral mri 
recent years biotechnology biomedical research benefited introduction variety specialized nanoparticles whose well-defined optically distinguishable signatures enable simultaneous tracking numerous biological indicators unfortunately equivalent multiplexing capabilities largely absent field magnetic resonance imaging mri comparable magnetic-resonance labels generally limited relatively simple chemically synthesized superparamagnetic microparticles large extent indistinguishable one another show instead possible use top-down microfabrication approach effectively encode distinguishable spectral signatures geometry magnetic microstructures although based different physical principles optically probed nanoparticles geometrically defined magnetic microstructures permit multiplexing functionality magnetic resonance radio-frequency spectrum many ways analogous permitted quantum dots optical spectrum additionally situ modification particle geometries may facilitate radio-frequency probing various local physiological variables
