resolving photon number states superconducting circuit 
electromagnetic signals always composed photons although circuit domain signals carried voltages currents wires discreteness photons energy usually evident however coupling superconducting quantum bit qubit signals microwave transmission line possible construct integrated circuit presence absence even single photon can dramatic effect system1 can described circuit quantum electrodynamics qed circuit equivalent cavity qed photons interact atoms quantum dots previously circuit qed devices shown reach resonant strong coupling regime single qubit absorb re-emit single photon many times2 report circuit qed experiment strong dispersive limit new regime single photon large effect qubit without ever absorbed hallmark strong dispersive regime qubit transition energy can resolved separate spectral line photon number state microwave field strength line measure probability finding corresponding photon number cavity effect used distinguish coherent thermal fields used create photon statistics analyser photons absorbed process possible generate non-classical states light measurement perform qubit photon conditional logic basis logic bus quantum computer
