ancestral monogamy shows kin selection key evolution eusociality 
close relatedness long considered crucial evolution eusociality however recently suggested close relatedness may consequence rather cause eusociality tested idea comparative analysis female mating frequencies species eusocial bees wasps ants found mating single male maximizes relatedness ancestral eight independent eusocial lineages investigated mating multiple males always derived furthermore found high polyandry > effective mates occurs lineages whose workers lost reproductive totipotency results provide first evidence monogamy critical evolution eusociality strongly supporting prediction inclusive fitness theory
