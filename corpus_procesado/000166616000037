directed assembly one-dimensional nanostructures functional networks 
one-dimensional nanostructures nanowires nanotubes represent smallest dimension efficient transport electrons excitons thus ideal building blocks hierarchical assembly functional nanoscale electronic photonic structures report approach hierarchical assembly one-dimensional nanostructures well-defined functional networks show nanowires can assembled parallel arrays control average separation combining fluidic alignment surface-patterning techniques also possible control periodicity addition complex crossed nanowire arrays can prepared layer-by-layer assembly different flow directions sequential steps transport studies show crossed nanowire arrays form electrically conducting networks individually addressable device function cross point
