multifunctional organoboron compounds scalable natural product synthesis 
efficient catalytic reactions can generate c-c bonds enantioselectively ones can produce trisubstituted alkenes diastereoselectively central research organic chemistry transformations accomplish two tasks simultaneously high demand particularly catalysts substrates reagents inexpensive reaction conditions mild report facile multicomponent catalytic process begins chemoselective site-selective diastereoselective copper-boron addition monosubstituted allene; resulting boron-substituted organocopper intermediates participate similarly selective allylic substitution products contain stereogenic carbon centre monosubstituted alkene easily functionalizable z-trisubstituted alkenylboron group obtained per cent yield per cent branch-selectivity stereoselectivity enantiomeric ratio greater : copper-based catalyst derived robust heterocyclic salt can prepared multigram quantities inexpensive starting materials without costly purification procedures utility approach demonstrated enantioselective synthesis gram quantities two natural products namely rottnestol herboxidiene also known gex1a
