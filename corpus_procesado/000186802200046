structure importin-beta bound srebp-: nuclear import transcription factor
sterol regulatory element binding protein srebp- nuclear transcription factor essential cholesterol metabolism enters nucleus direct interaction helix-loop-helix leucine zipper domain importin-beta show crystal structure importin-beta complexed active form srebp- importin-beta uses characteristic long helices like pair chopsticks interact srebp dimer importin-beta changes conformation reveal pseudo-twofold symmetry surface structure can accommodate symmetric dimer molecule importin-beta may use similar strategy recognize dimeric cargoes
