cancer pharmacogenomics: early promise concerted effort needed
past decade brought together substantial advances human genome analysis maturation understanding tumor biology although much progress still made now several prominent examples tumor-associated somatic mutations used identify cellular signaling pathways tumors turn led development targeted therapies somatic mutations serving genomic predictors tumor response providing new leads drug development also realization germline dna variants can help optimize cancer drug dosing predict susceptibility patients adverse side effects drugs-knowledge ultimately can used improve benefit: risk ratio cancer treatment individual patients
