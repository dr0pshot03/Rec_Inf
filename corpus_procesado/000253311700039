extending earthquakes reach cascading
earthquakes whatever size can trigger earthquakes mainshocks cause aftershocks occur turn activate local aftershock sequences resulting cascade triggering extends reach initial mainshock long lasting difficulty determine earthquakes connected either directly indirectly show causal structure can found probabilistically priori model parameterization large regional earthquakes found short direct influence comparison overall aftershock sequence duration relative large mainshocks small earthquakes collectively greater effect triggering hence cascade triggering key component earthquake interactions
