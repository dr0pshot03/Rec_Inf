autonomic healing polymer composites
structural polymers susceptible damage form cracks form deep within structure detection difficult repair almost impossible cracking leads mechanical degradation- fibre-reinforced polymer composites microelectronic polymeric components can also lead electrical failure microcracking induced thermal mechanical fatigue also long-standing problem polymer adhesives regardless application cracks formed within polymeric materials integrity structure significantly compromised experiments exploring concept self-repair previously reported- successful crack-healing methods reported far require form manual intervention- report structural polymeric material ability autonomically heal cracks material incorporates microencapsulated healing agent released upon crack intrusion polymerization healing agent triggered contact embedded catalyst bonding crack faces fracture experiments yield much % recovery toughness expect approach will applicable brittle materials systems including ceramics glasses
