optical imaging tactile illusion area 3b primary somatosensory cortex 
tactile funneling illusion simultaneous presentation brief stimuli multiple points skin produces single focal sensation center stimulus pattern even physical stimulus occurs site consistent funneling percept show optical imaging area 3b primary somatosensory cortex si simultaneous stimulation two fingertips produces single focal cortical activation single fingertip activation regions thus contrast traditional views body map topographic representation si reflects perceived rather physical location peripheral stimulation
