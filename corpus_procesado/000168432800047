cortical areas generally assumed uniform capacity adaptive changes plasticity1- demonstrate however neurons cat striate cortex v1 show pronounced adaptation-induced short-term plasticity orientation tuning primarily specific foci v1 neurons clustered according orientation preference iso-orientation domains5 converge singularities pinwheel centres67 although neurons pinwheel centres similar orientation tuning responses iso-orientation domains rnd differ markedly capacity adaptive changes 
adaptation oriented drifting grating stimulus alters responses neurons located near pinwheel centres broad range orientations causing repulsive shifts orientation preference changes response magnitude contrast neurons located iso-orientation domains show minimal changes tuning properties adaptation anisotropy adaptation-induced orientation plasticity probably mediated inhomogeneities local intracortical interactions overlaid map orientation preference v1
