transvascular delivery small interfering rna central nervous system
major impediment treatment neurological diseases presence blood brain barrier precludes entry therapeutic molecules blood brain show short peptide derived rabies virus glycoprotein rvg enables transvascular delivery small interfering rna sirna brain amino-acid peptide specifically binds acetylcholine receptor expressed neuronal cells enable sirna binding chimaeric peptide synthesized adding nonamer arginine residues carboxy terminus rvg rvg-9r peptide able bind transduce sirna neuronal cells vitro resulting efficient gene silencing intravenous injection mice rvg-9r delivered sirna neuronal cells resulting specific gene silencing within brain furthermore intravenous treatment rvg-9r-bound antiviral sirna afforded robust protection fatal viral encephalitis mice repeated administration rvg-9r-bound sirna induce inflammatory cytokines anti-peptide antibodies thus rvg-9r provides safe noninvasive approach delivery sirna potentially therapeutic molecules across blood brain barrier
