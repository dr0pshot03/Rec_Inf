proteoglycan mediates inductive interaction plant vascular development 
inductive cell-cell interactions essential controlling cell fate determination plants animals however chemical basis inductive signals plants remains little understood proteoglycan-like factor named xylogen mediates local inductive cell-cell interactions required xylem differentiation zinnia cells cultured vitro describe purification xylogen cloning complementary dna present evidence role planta polypeptide backbone xylogen hybrid-type molecule properties arabinogalactan proteins nonspecific lipid-transfer proteins xylogen predominantly accumulates meristem procambium xylem xylem xylogen polar localization cell walls differentiating tracheary elements double knockouts arabidopsis lacking genes encode xylogen proteins show defects vascular development: discontinuous veins improperly interconnected vessel elements simplified venation results suggest polar secretion xylogen draws neighbouring cells pathway vascular differentiation direct continuous vascular development thereby identifying molecule mediates inductive cell cell interaction involved plant tissue differentiation
