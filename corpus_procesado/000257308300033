dissecting direct reprogramming integrative genomic analysis
somatic cells can reprogrammed pluripotent state ectopic expression defined transcription factors understanding mechanism kinetics transformation may shed light nature developmental potency suggest strategies improved efficiency safety report integrative genomic analysis reprogramming mouse fibroblasts b lymphocytes lineage committed cells show complex response ectopic expression involving induction genes downstream individual reprogramming factors fully reprogrammed cells show gene expression epigenetic states highly similar embryonic stem cells contrast stable partially reprogrammed cell lines show reactivation distinctive subset stem cell related genes incomplete repression lineage specifying transcription factors dna hypermethylation pluripotency related loci observations suggest cells may become trapped partially reprogrammed states owing incomplete repression transcription factors dna de methylation inefficient step transition pluripotency demonstrate rna inhibition transcription factors can facilitate reprogramming treatment dna methyltransferase inhibitors can improve overall efficiency reprogramming process
