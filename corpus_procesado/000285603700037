dynamics magnetic domain walls inertia
motion magnetic domain walls induced spin-polarized current considerable potential use magnetic memory logic devices key success devices precise positioning individual domain walls along magnetic nanowires using current pulses show domain walls move surprisingly long distances several micrometers relax several tens nanoseconds inertia current stimulus removed also show net distance traveled domain wall exactly proportional current pulse length lag derived acceleration onset pulse thus independent inertia domain wall can accurately positioned using properly timed current pulses
