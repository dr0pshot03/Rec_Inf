adaptation via symbiosis: recent spread drosophila defensive symbiont 
recent studies shown plants animals harbor microbial symbionts protect natural enemies demonstrate maternally transmitted bacterium spiroplasma protects drosophila neotestacea sterilizing effects parasitic nematode laboratory field nematode parasitizes d neotestacea high frequencies natural populations recently almost infections resulted complete sterility several lines evidence suggest spiroplasma spreading north american populations d neotestacea major adaptive change symbiont-based mode defense way findings demonstrate profound potentially rapid effects defensive symbionts increasingly recognized major players ecology species interactions
