three-dimensional control light two-dimensional photonic crystal slab
optoelectronic devices increasingly important communication information technology achieve necessary manipulation light carries information optoelectronic devices considerable efforts directed development photonic crystals-periodic dielectric materials so-called photonic bandgaps prohibit propagation photons energies within bandgap region straightforward application bandgap concept generally thought require three-dimensional 3d photonic crystals- two-dimensional 2d counterparts confine light crystal plane perpendicular z direction inevitably leads diffraction losses nonetheless 2d photonic crystals still attract interest- potentially amenable fabrication existing techniques diffraction losses need seriously impair utility report fabrication waveguide-coupled photonic crystal slab essentially free-standing 2d photonic crystal strong 2d bandgap wavelengths mum yet capable fully controlling light three dimensions features confirm theoretical calculations possibility achieving 3d light control using 2d bandgaps index guiding providing control third dimension raise prospect able realize unusual photonic-crystal devices thresholdless lasers
