atmospheric warming amplification precipitation extremes
climate models suggest extreme precipitation events will become common anthropogenically warmed climate however observational limitations hindered direct evaluation model projected changes extreme precipitation used satellite observations model simulations examine response tropical precipitation events naturally driven changes surface temperature atmospheric moisture content observations reveal distinct link rainfall extremes temperature heavy rain events increasing warm periods decreasing cold periods furthermore observed amplification rainfall extremes found larger predicted models implying projections future changes rainfall extremes response anthropogenic global warming may underestimated
