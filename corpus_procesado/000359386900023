self-renewing diploid axin2+ cells fuel homeostatic renewal liver
source new hepatocytes uninjured liver remained open question lineage tracing using wnt-responsive gene axin2 mice identify population proliferating self-renewing cells adjacent central vein liver lobule pericentral cells express early liver progenitor marker tbx3 diploid thereby differ mature hepatocytes mostly polyploid descendants pericentral cells differentiate tbx3-negative polyploid hepatocytes can replace hepatocytes along liver lobule homeostatic renewal adjacent central vein endothelial cells provide wnt signals maintain pericentral cells thereby constituting niche thus identify cell population liver subserves homeostatic hepatocyte renewal characterize anatomical niche identify molecular signals regulate activity
