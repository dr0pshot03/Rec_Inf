direct coupling meiotic dna replication recombination initiation 
meiosis saccharomyces cerevisiae dna replication occurs hours recombination initiates dna double-strand break formation show replication recombination initiation directly linked blocking meiotic replication prevented double-strand break formation replication-checkpoint-independent manner delaying replication chromosome segment specifically delayed break formation segment consequently time replication break formation held constant regions suggest double-strand break formation occurs part process initiated dna replication thus determines meiotic recombination initiates regional rather cell-wide basis
