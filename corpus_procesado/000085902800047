target-oriented diversity-oriented organic synthesis drug discovery 
modern drug discovery often involves screening small molecules ability bind preselected protein target target-oriented syntheses small molecules individually collections focused libraries can planned effectively retrosynthetic analysis drug discovery can also involve screening small molecules ability modulate biological pathway cells organisms without regard particular protein target process likely benefit future evolving forward analysis synthetic pathways used diversity-oriented synthesis leads structurally complex diverse small molecules one goal diversity-oriented syntheses synthesize efficiently collection small molecules capable perturbing disease-related biological pathway leading eventually identification therapeutic protein targets capable modulated small molecules several synthetic planning principles diversity-oriented synthesis role drug discovery process presented review
