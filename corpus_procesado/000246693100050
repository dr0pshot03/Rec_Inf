redox-mediated substrate recognition sdp1 defines new group tyrosine phosphatases 
reactive oxygen species trigger cellular responses activation stress-responsive mitogen-activated protein kinase mapk signalling pathways reversal mapk activation requires transcriptional induction specialized cysteine-based phosphatases mediate mapk dephosphorylation paradoxically oxidative stresses generally inactivate cysteine-based phosphatases thiol modification thus lead sustained uncontrolled mapk activation describe stress-inducible mapk phosphatase sdp1 presents unusual solution apparent paradox acquiring enhanced catalytic activity oxidative conditions structural biochemical evidence reveals sdp1 employs intramolecular disulphide bridge invariant histidine side chain selectively recognize tyrosine-phosphorylated mapk substrate optimal activity critically requires disulphide bridge thus best knowledge sdp1 first example cysteine-dependent phosphatase couples oxidative stress substrate recognition show sdp1 paralogue msg5 similar properties belong new group phosphatases unique yeast fungal taxa
