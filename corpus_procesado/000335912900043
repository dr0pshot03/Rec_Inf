neurosensory perception environmental cues modulates sperm motility critical fertilization
environmental exposures affect gamete function fertility mechanisms poorly understood show pheromones sensed ciliated neurons caenorhabditis elegans nose alter lipid microenvironment within oviduct thereby affecting sperm motility favorable environments pheromone-responsive sensory neurons secrete transforming growth factor-beta ligand called daf- acts neuroendocrine factor stimulates prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase [cyclooxygenase cox]-independent prostaglandin synthesis ovary oocytes secrete f-class prostaglandins guide sperm toward prostaglandins also synthesized cox knockout mice raising possibility similar mechanisms exist animals data indicate environmental cues perceived female nervous system affect sperm function
