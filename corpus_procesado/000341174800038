tumour-derived pth-related protein triggers adipose tissue browning cancer cachexia
cachexia wasting disorder adipose skeletal muscle tissues leads profound weight loss frailty half cancer patients suffer cachexia impairs quality life limits cancer therapy decreases survival one key characteristic cachexia higher resting energy expenditure levels healthy individuals linked greater thermogenesis brown fat- tumours induce brown fat activity unknown using lewis lung carcinoma model cancer cachexia show tumour-derived parathyroid-hormone-related protein pthrp important role wasting driving expression genes involved thermogenesis adipose tissues neutralization pthrp tumour-bearing mice blocked adipose tissue browning loss muscle mass strength results demonstrate pthrp mediates energy wasting fat tissues contributes broader aspects cancer cachexia thus neutralization pthrp might hold promise ameliorating cancer cachexia improving patient survival
