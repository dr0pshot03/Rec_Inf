taf-containing taf-independent forms transcriptionally active tbp vivo 
transcriptional activity yeast strongly correlates promoter occupancy general factors tata binding protein tbp tfiia tfiib occupancy tbp-associated factors tafs thus tbp exists least two transcriptionally active forms vivo taf-containing form corresponds tfiid complex whereas form lacking tafs corresponds tbp tbp complex heat shock treatment altered relative utilization tbp forms tfiid favored promoter-specific variations association distinct forms tbp may explain yeast genes require tfiid transcriptional activity vivo
