methyl salicylate critical mobile signal plant systemic acquired resistance
plants mobile signal systemic acquired resistance sar organism-wide state enhanced defense subsequent infections elusive stimulating immune responses mosaic tobacco plants created grafting different genetic backgrounds showed methyl salicylate mesa esterase activity salicylic acid-binding protein sabp2 converts mesa salicylic acid sa required sar signal perception systemic tissue tissue receive primary initial infection moreover plants expressing mutant sabp2 unregulated mesa esterase activity sar signal-generating primary infected leaves sar compromised associated increase mesa levels suppressed primary infected leaves phloem exudates systemic leaves sar also blocked sa methyl transferase converts sa mesa silenced primary infected leaves mesa treatment lower leaves induced sar upper untreated leaves therefore conclude mesa sar signal tobacco
