imaginal discs secrete insulin-like peptide mediate plasticity growth maturation
developing animals frequently adjust growth programs and/or maturation metamorphosis compensate growth disturbances injury tumor ensure normal adult size plasticity entails tissue organ communication preserve proportions symmetry show imaginal discs autonomously activate dilp8 drosophila insulin-like peptide communicate abnormal growth postpone maturation dilp8 delays metamorphosis inhibiting ecdysone biosynthesis slowing growth imaginal discs generating normal-sized animals loss dilp8 yields asymmetric individuals unusually large variation size varied time maturation thus dilp8 fundamental element hitherto ill-defined machinery governing plasticity ensures developmental stability robustness
