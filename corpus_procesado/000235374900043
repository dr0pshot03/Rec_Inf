molecular jump mechanism water reorientation
despite long study molecular picture mechanism water reorientation still lacking using numerical simulations find support pathway rotating water molecule breaks hydrogen bond h-bond overcoordinated first-shell neighbor form h-bond undercoordinated second-shell neighbor h-bond cleavage molecular reorientation occur concertedly successively usually considered water reorientation mechanism involves large-amplitude angular jumps rather commonly accepted sequence small diffusive steps therefore calls reinterpretation many experimental data wherein water rotational relaxation assumed diffusive
