decoding reveals contents visual working memory early visual areas
visual working memory provides essential link perception higher cognitive functions allowing active maintenance information stimuli longer view research suggests sustained activity higher-order prefrontal parietal inferotemporal lateral occipital areas supports visual maintenance- may account limited capacity working memory hold items- higher-order areas lack visual selectivity early sensory areas remained unclear observers can remember specific visual features precise orientation grating minimal decay performance delays many seconds one proposal sensory areas serve maintain fine-tuned feature information early visual areas show little sustained activity prolonged delays- show orientations held working memory can decoded activity patterns human visual cortex even overall levels activity low using functional magnetic resonance imaging pattern classification methods found activity patterns visual areas v1-v4 predict two oriented gratings held memory mean accuracy levels upwards % even participants whose activity fell baseline levels prolonged delay orientation-selective activity patterns sustained throughout delay period evident individual visual areas similar responses evoked unattended task-irrelevant gratings results demonstrate early visual areas can retain specific information visual features held working memory periods many seconds physical stimulus present
