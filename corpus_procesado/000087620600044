controlling droplet deposition polymer additives 
controlling impact drops onto solid surfaces important wide variety coating deposition processes-for example treatment plants herbicides pesticides requires precise targeting order meet stringent toxicological regulations however outer wax-like layer leaves non-wetting substrate causes sprayed droplets rebound often less % initial spray retained plant although impact subsequent retraction non-wetting aqueous drops hydrophobic surface subjects extensive experimental theoretical work- non-newtonian rheological effects considered detail report adding small amounts flexible polymer aqueous phase can inhibit droplet rebound hydrophobic surface markedly improve deposition without significantly altering shear viscosity solutions results can understood taking account non-newtonian elongational viscosity provides large resistance drop retraction impact thereby suppressing droplet rebound
