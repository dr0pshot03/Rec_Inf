coordinate regulation transcription splicing steroid receptor coregulators
recent observations indicating promoter identity influences alternative rna-processing decisions created interest regulatory interactions rna polymerase ii transcription precursor messenger rna pre-mrna processing examined impact steroid receptor mediated transcription rna processing reporter genes subject alternative splicing driven steroid sensitive promoters steroid hormones affected processing pre-mrna synthesized steroid-sensitive promoters steroid-unresponsive promoters steroid receptor dependent receptor-selective manner several nuclear receptor coregulators showed differential splicing effects suggesting steroid hormone receptors may simultaneously control gene transcription activity exon content product mrna recruiting coregulators involved processes
