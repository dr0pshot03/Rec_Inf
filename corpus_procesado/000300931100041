high-latitude dust north atlantic: inputs icelandic proglacial dust storms 
mineral aerosols play important role atmosphere-ocean climate system research focused almost exclusively sources low-latitude arid regions show substantial sources cold higher latitudes -year record measurements made heimaey island south iceland reveals frequent dust events concentrations exceeding micrograms per cubic meter much potentially iron-rich dust transported southward deposited north atlantic emissions highest spring spatially temporally associated active glacial outwash plains; large dust events appear associated glacial outburst floods response global warming ice retreat iceland glacierized areas likely increase dust emissions regions
