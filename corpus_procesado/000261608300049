regulation dendritic cell migration cd74 mhc class ii-associated invariant chain
dendritic cells dcs sample peripheral tissues body search antigens present t cells requires two processes antigen processing cell motility originally thought occur independently found major histocompatibility complex ii associated invariant chain li cd74 known regulator antigen processing negatively regulates dc motility vivo using microfabricated channels mimic confined environment peripheral tissues found wild type dcs alternate high low motility whereas li-deficient cells moved faster uniform manner regulation cell motility li depended actin based motor protein myosin ii coupling antigen processing cell motility may enable dcs efficiently detect process antigens within defined space
