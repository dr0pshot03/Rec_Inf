degradation paternal mitochondria fertilization-triggered autophagy c elegans embryos 
mitochondrial genome believed maternally inherited many eukaryotes sperm-derived paternal mitochondria enter oocyte cytoplasm upon fertilization normally disappear early embryogenesis however mechanism responsible clearance unknown show autophagy delivers cytosolic components lysosomes degradation required elimination paternal mitochondria caenorhabditis elegans immediately fertilization sperm-derived components trigger localized induction autophagy around sperm mitochondria autophagosomes engulf paternal mitochondria resulting lysosomal degradation early embryogenesis autophagy-defective zygotes paternal mitochondria genome remain even first larval stage thus fertilization-triggered autophagy required selective degradation paternal mitochondria thereby maternal inheritance mitochondrial dna
