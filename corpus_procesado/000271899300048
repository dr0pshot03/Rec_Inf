dynamic activation allosteric regulatory protein 
allosteric regulation used efficient mechanism control protein activity biological processes including signal transduction metabolism catalysis gene regulation1- allosteric proteins can exist several conformational states distinct binding enzymatic activity effectors considered function purely structural manner selectively stabilizing specific conformational state thereby regulating protein activity show allosteric proteins can regulated predominantly changes structural dynamics used nmr spectroscopy isothermal titration calorimetry characterize cyclic amp camp binding catabolite activator protein cap transcriptional activator prototype understanding effector-mediated allosteric control protein activity7 camp switches cap state inactive binds dna weakly non-specifically state active binds dna strongly specifically contrast camp binding single cap mutant cap-s62f fails elicit active conformation; yet camp binding cap-s62f strongly activates protein dna binding nmr thermodynamic analyses show despite fact cap-s62f-camp2 adopts inactive conformation strong binding dna driven large conformational entropy originating enhanced protein motions induced dna binding results provide strong evidence changes protein motions may activate allosteric proteins otherwise structurally inactive
