unveiling mechanisms cell-cell fusion 
cell-cell fusion fundamental development physiology multicellular organisms little known mechanistic underpinnings recent studies revealed many proteins involved cell-cell fusion also required seemingly unrelated cellular processes phagocytosis cell migration axon growth synaptogenesis review advances understanding cell-cell fusion contrasting virus-cell intracellular vesicle fusion also consider proteins involved general aspects membrane dynamics co-opted control fusion diverse cell types coupling specialized proteins involved cell-cell recognition adhesion signaling
