despite two centuries effort characterizing environmental gradients species richness search universal patterns surprisingly patterns widely acknowledged- species richness along altitudinal gradients previously assumed increase universally cool highlands warm lowlands mirroring latitudinal increase species richness cool warm latitudes however since recent general acceptance altitudinal gradients model templates testing hypotheses behind large scale patterns diversity- gradients used support main diversity hypotheses although little consensus achieved show resampling data set comprising records pyrenean floristic species different scales analysis achieved varying grain size extent gradients sampled derived species richness pattern changed progressively hump shaped monotonic pattern scale extent diminished scale effects alone gave rise many conflicting patterns species richness previously reported literature scale effects lent significantly different statistical support competing diversity hypotheses effects scale current studies may affected human activities montane ecosystems human activities intimately connected interdependence led global reduction natural lowland habitats hampering ability detect universal patterns impeding search universal diversity gradients discover mechanisms determining distribution biological diversity earth
