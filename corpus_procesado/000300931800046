evolutionarily assembled cis-regulatory module human ciliopathy locus
neighboring genes often coordinately expressed within cis-regulatory modules evidence nonparalogous genes share functions mammals lacking report mutation either tmem138 tmem216 causes phenotypically indistinguishable human ciliopathy joubert syndrome despite lack sequence homology genes aligned head-to-tail configuration joined chromosomal rearrangement amphibian-to-reptile evolutionary transition expression two genes mediated conserved regulatory element noncoding intergenic region coordinated expression important interdependent cellular role vesicular transport primary cilia hence vertebrate evolution genes involved ciliogenesis nonparalogous genes arranged functional gene cluster shared regulatory elements
