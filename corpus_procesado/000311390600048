content-specific fronto-parietal synchronization visual working memory
lateral prefrontal posterior parietal cortical areas exhibit task-dependent activation working memory tasks humans monkeys neurons regions become synchronized attention-demanding tasks contribution interactions working memory largely unknown using simultaneous recordings neural activity multiple areas regions find widespread task-dependent content-specific synchronization activity across fronto-parietal network visual working memory patterns synchronization prevalent among stimulus-selective neurons governed influences arising parietal cortex results indicate short-term memories represented large-scale patterns synchronized activity across fronto-parietal network
