mechanosensory complex mediates endothelial cell response fluid shear stress
shear stress fundamental determinant vascular homeostasis regulating vascular remodelling cardiac development atherogenesis mechanisms transduction poorly understood previous work showed conversion integrins high-affinity state mediates subset shear responses including cell alignment gene expression- investigate pathway upstream integrin activation pecam directly transmits mechanical force vascular endothelial cell cadherin functions adaptor vegfr2 activates phosphatidylinositol--oh kinase comprise mechanosensory complex together receptors sufficient confer responsiveness flow heterologous cells support relevance pathway vivo pecam--knockout mice activate nf-kappa b downstream inflammatory genes regions disturbed flow therefore mechanosensing pathway required earliest-known events atherogenesis
