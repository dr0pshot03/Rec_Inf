primordial origin compositional similarity earth moon 
properties earth-moon system can explained collision planetary embryo giant impactor growing earth late accretion process simulations show material eventually aggregates form moon originates impactor however analysis terrestrial lunar isotopic compositions show highly similar- contrast compositions solar system bodies significantly different earth moon- suggesting different solar system bodies distinct compositions challenges giant impact scenario moon-forming impactor must also thought composition different proto-earth track feeding zones growing planets suite simulations planetary accretion measure composition moon-forming impactors find different planets formed simulation distinct compositions compositions giant impactors statistically similar planets impact large fraction planet-impactor pairs almost identical compositions thus similarity composition earth moon natural consequence late giant impact
