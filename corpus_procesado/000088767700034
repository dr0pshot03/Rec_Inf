atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations past million years
knowledge evolution atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations throughout earths history important reconstruction links climate radiative forcing earths surface temperatures although atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations early cenozoic era myr ago widely believed higher present disagreement regarding exact carbon dioxide levels timing decline mechanisms important control co2 concentrations geological timescales use boron-isotope ratios ancient planktonic foraminifer shells estimate ph surface-layer sea water throughout past million years can used reconstruct atmospheric co2 concentrations estimate co2 concentrations ppm late palaeocene earliest eocene periods myr ago rnd erratic decline myr ago may caused reduced co2 outgassing ocean ridges volcanoes metamorphic belts increased carbon burial since early miocene myr ago atmospheric co2 concentrations appear remained ppm stable although transient intervals co2 reduction may occurred periods rapid cooling approximately myr ago
