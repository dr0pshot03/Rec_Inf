formyl peptide receptor-like proteins novel family vomeronasal chemosensors
mammals rely heavily olfaction interact adequately environment make use seven-transmembrane g-protein-coupled receptors identify odorants pheromones receptors present dendrites olfactory sensory neurons located main olfactory vomeronasal sensory epithelia pertain odorant trace amine-associated receptor vomeronasal type ref refs receptor superfamilies whether four sensor classes represent complete olfactory molecular repertoire used mammals make sense outside world unknown report expression formyl peptide receptor-related genes vomeronasal sensory neurons multiple mammalian species similar four known olfactory receptor gene classes genes encode seven-transmembrane proteins characterized monogenic transcription punctate expression pattern sensory neuroepithelium vitro expression mouse formyl peptide receptor-like provides sensitivity disease/inflammation-related ligands establishing situ approach combines whole-mount vomeronasal preparations dendritic calcium imaging intact neuroepithelium show neuronal responses molecules therefore represent new class vomeronasal agonists taken together results suggest formyl peptide receptor-like proteins olfactory function associated identification pathogens pathogenic states
