genome-wide location function dna binding proteins
understanding dna binding proteins control global gene expression chromosomal maintenance requires knowledge chromosomal locations proteins function vivo developed microarray method reveals genome-wide location dna-bound proteins used method monitor binding gene-specific transcription activators yeast combination location expression profiles used identify genes whose expression directly controlled gal4 ste12 cells respond changes carbon source mating pheromone respectively results identify pathways coordinately regulated two activators reveal previously unknown functions gal4 ste12 genome-wide location analysis will facilitate investigation gene regulatory networks gene function genome maintenance
