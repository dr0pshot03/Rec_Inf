genome-wide quantitative enhancer activity maps identified starr-seq 
genomic enhancers important regulators gene expression identification challenge methods depend indirect measures activity developed method termed starr-seq directly quantitatively assess enhancer activity millions candidates arbitrary sources dna enables screens across entire genomes applied drosophila genome starr-seq identifies thousands cell type-specific enhancers across broad continuum strengths links differential gene expression differences enhancer activity creates genome-wide quantitative enhancer map map reveals highly complex regulation transcription several independent enhancers developmental regulators ubiquitously expressed genes starr-seq can used identify quantify enhancer activity eukaryotes including humans
