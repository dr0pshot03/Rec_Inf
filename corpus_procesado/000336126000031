amygdala interneuron subtypes control fear learning disinhibition 
learning mediated experience-dependent plasticity neuronal circuits activity neuronal circuits tightly regulated different subtypes inhibitory interneurons yet role learning poorly understood using combination vivo single-unit recordings optogenetic manipulations show mouse basolateral amygdala interneurons expressing parvalbumin pv somatostatin som bidirectionally control acquisition fear conditioning-a simple form associative learning-through two distinct disinhibitory mechanisms auditory cue pv+ interneurons excited indirectly disinhibit dendrites basolateral amygdala principal neurons via som+ interneurons thereby enhancing auditory responses promoting cue-shock associations aversive footshock however pv+ som+ interneurons inhibited boosts postsynaptic footshock responses gates learning results demonstrate associative learning dynamically regulated stimulus-specific activation distinct disinhibitory microcircuits precise interactions different subtypes local interneurons
