functional architecture evolution transcriptional elements drive gene coexpression
transcriptional coexpression interacting gene products required complex molecular processes however function evolution cis-regulatory elements orchestrate coexpression remain largely unexplored mutagenized regulatory elements drive coexpression ciona muscle genes obtained quantitative estimates cis-regulatory activity motifs comprise elements found individual motif activity ranges broadly within among elements among different instantiations motif type activity orthologous motifs strongly constrained although motif arrangement type activity vary greatly among elements different co-regulated genes thus syntactical rules governing regulatory function flexible become highly constrained evolutionarily established particular element
