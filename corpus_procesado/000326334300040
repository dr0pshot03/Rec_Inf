circadian clock nad+ cycle drives mitochondrial oxidative metabolism mice
circadian clocks self-sustained cellular oscillators synchronize oxidative reductive cycles anticipation solar cycle found clock transcription feedback loop produces cycles nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide nad+ biosynthesis adenosine triphosphate production mitochondrial respiration modulation mitochondrial protein acetylation synchronize oxidative metabolic pathways hour fasting feeding cycle circadian control activity nad+-dependent deacetylase sirtuin sirt3 generated rhythms acetylation activity oxidative enzymes respiration isolated mitochondria nad+ supplementation restored protein deacetylation enhanced oxygen consumption circadian mutant mice thus circadian control nad+ bioavailability modulates mitochondrial oxidative function organismal metabolism across daily cycles fasting feeding
