electronic transitions perovskite: possible nonconvecting layers lower mantle 
measured spin state iron magnesium silicate perovskite mg-fe- sio3 high pressure found two electronic transitions occurring gigapascals gigapascals corresponding partial full electron pairing iron respectively proportion iron low spin state thus grows depth increasing transparency mantle infrared region maximum pressures consistent d layer core-mantle boundary resulting increase radiative thermal conductivity suggests existence nonconvecting layers lowermost mantle
