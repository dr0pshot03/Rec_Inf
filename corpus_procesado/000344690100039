large sulfur isotope fractionations associated neoarchean microbial sulfate reduction
minor extent sulfur isotope fractionation preserved many neoarchean sedimentary successions suggests sulfate-reducing microorganisms played insignificant role ancient marine environments despite evidence organisms evolved much earlier present bulk microdrilled ion probe sulfur isotope data carbonate-associated pyrite similar -billion-year-old batatal formation brazil revealing large mass-dependent fractionations approaching per mil associated microbial sulfate reduction well consistently negative delta s values similar per mil indicative atmospheric photochemical reactions persistent s depletion similar meters shallow marine carbonate implies long-term stability seawater sulfate abundance isotope composition contrast negative delta s excursion lower batatal strata indicates response time similar years suggesting neoarchean sulfate concentrations similar mu m
