intraspecific competition favours niche width expansion drosophila melanogaster 
ecologists proposed interspecific competition reduced competition within species becomes potent evolutionary force leading rapid diversification1 view reflects observation populations invading species-poor communities frequently evolve broader niches2 niche expansion can associated increase phenotypic variance34 known character release5 evolution polymorphisms6- divergence many species using distinct resources10- adaptive radiation relationship intraspecific competition diversification known theory1415 used foundation models speciation16- however little empirical proof niches evolve response intraspecific competition test hypothesis introduced cadmium-intolerant drosophila melanogaster populations environments containing cadmium-free cadmium-laced resources show populations experiencing high competition adapted cadmium rapidly low competition populations provides experimental confirmation competition population can drive niche expansion onto new resources competition less severe
