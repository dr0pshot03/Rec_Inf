intraspecific competition favours niche width expansion drosophila melanogaster
ecologists proposed interspecific competition reduced competition within species becomes potent evolutionary force leading rapid diversification view reflects observation populations invading species-poor communities frequently evolve broader niches niche expansion can associated increase phenotypic variance known character release evolution polymorphisms- divergence many species using distinct resources- adaptive radiation relationship intraspecific competition diversification known theory used foundation models speciation- however little empirical proof niches evolve response intraspecific competition test hypothesis introduced cadmium-intolerant drosophila melanogaster populations environments containing cadmium-free cadmium-laced resources show populations experiencing high competition adapted cadmium rapidly low competition populations provides experimental confirmation competition population can drive niche expansion onto new resources competition less severe
