ultrafast bond softening bismuth: mapping solids interatomic potential x-rays
intense femtosecond laser excitation can produce transient states matter otherwise inaccessible laboratory investigation high excitation densities interatomic forces bind solids determine many properties can substantially altered present detailed mapping carrier density-dependent interatomic potential bismuth approaching solid-solid phase transition experiments combine stroboscopic techniques use high-brightness linear electron accelerator-based x-ray source pulse-by-pulse timing reconstruction femtosecond resolution allowing quantitative characterization interatomic potential energy surface highly excited solid
