treatment ischemic brain damage perturbing nmda receptor-psd protein interactions
n-methyl-d-aspartate receptors nmdars mediate ischemic brain damage also mediate essential neuronal excitation treat stroke without blocking nmdars transduced neurons peptides disrupted interaction nmdars postsynaptic density protein psd- procedure dissociated nmdars downstream neurotoxic signaling without blocking synaptic activity calcium influx peptides applied either hour insult protected cultured neurons excitotoxicity reduced focal ischemic brain damage rats improved neurological function approach circumvents negative consequences associated blocking nmdars may constitute practical stroke therapy
