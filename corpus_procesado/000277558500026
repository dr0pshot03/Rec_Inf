aberrant silencing imprinted genes chromosome 12qf1 mouse induced pluripotent stem cells
induced pluripotent stem cells ipscs generated enforced expression defined sets transcription factors somatic cells remains controversial whether ipscs molecularly functionally equivalent blastocyst-derived embryonic stem es cells comparing genetically identical mouse es cells ipscs show overall messenger rna microrna expression patterns indistinguishable exception transcripts encoded within imprinted dlk1-dio3 gene cluster chromosome 12qf1 aberrantly silenced ipsc clones consistent developmental role dlk1-dio3 gene cluster ipsc clones contributed poorly chimaeras failed support development entirely ipsc-derived animals all-ipsc mice contrast ipsc clones normal expression dlk1-dio3 cluster contributed high-grade chimaeras generated viable all-ipsc mice notably treatment ipsc clone silenced dlk1-dio3 histone deacetylase inhibitor reactivated locus rescued ability support full-term development all-ipsc mice thus expression state single imprinted gene cluster seems distinguish murine ipscs es cells allows prospective identification ipsc clones full development potential es cells
