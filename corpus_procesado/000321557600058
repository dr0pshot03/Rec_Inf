metal-free oxidation aromatic carbon-hydrogen bonds reverse-rebound mechanism
methods carbon-hydrogen c-h bond oxidation fundamental role synthetic organic chemistry providing functionality required final target molecule facilitating subsequent chemical transformations several approaches oxidizing aliphatic c-h bonds described drastically simplifying synthesis complex molecules- however selective oxidation aromatic c-h bonds mild conditions especially context substituted arenes diverse functional groups remains challenge direct hydroxylation arenes initially achieved use strong bronsted lewis acids mediate electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions super-stoichiometric equivalents oxidants significantly limiting scope reaction products reactions reactive starting materials over-oxidation frequently competitive process transition-metal-catalysed c-h oxidation arenes without directing groups developed improving acid-mediated process however precious metals required- demonstrate phthaloyl peroxide functions selective oxidant transformation arenes phenols mild conditions although reaction proceeds radical mechanism aromatic c-h bonds selectively oxidized preference activated csp3-h bonds notably wide array functional groups compatible reaction method therefore well suited late-stage transformations advanced synthetic intermediates quantum mechanical calculations indicate transformation proceeds novel addition-abstraction mechanism kind reverse-rebound mechanism distinct common oxygen-rebound mechanism observed metal-oxo oxidants calculations also identify origins experimentally observed aryl selectivity
