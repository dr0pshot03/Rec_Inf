decoherence quantum superpositions coupling engineered reservoirs 
theory quantum mechanics applies closed systems ideal situations single atom can example exist simultaneously superposition two different spatial locations contrast real systems always interact environment consequence macroscopic quantum superpositions illustrated schrodingers cat thought-experiment observed moreover macroscopic superpositions decay quickly even dynamics decoherence cannotbe observed however mesoscopic systems offer possibility observing decoherence quantum superpositions present measurements decoherence superposed motional states single trapped atom decoherence induced coupling atom engineered reservoirs coupling state environment controllable perform three experiments finding decoherence rate scales square quantity describing amplitude superposition state
