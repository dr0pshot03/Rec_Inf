explanation far fracture spacing layered materials 
spacing opening-mode fractures layered materials-such certain sedimentary rocks laminated engineering materials-is often proportional thickness fractured layer- experimental studies phenomenon show spacing initially decreases extensional strain increases direction perpendicular fractures certain ratio spacing layer thickness new fractures form additional strain accommodated opening existing fractures: spacing simply scales layer thickness called fracture saturation marked contrast existing theories fracture stress-transfer theory predict spacing decrease increasing strain ad infinitum recently two us tb ddp used combination numerical simulations laboratory experiments show increasing applied stress normal stress acting fractures undergoes transition tensile compressive suggesting cause fracture saturation investigate full stress distribution fractures derive intuitive physical model process fracture saturation model find wide applicability geosciences- engineering
