effects molecular memory bursting fluctuations gene expression
many cellular components present low numbers per cell random births deaths individual molecules can cause substantial noise concentrations biochemical events necessarily occur single steps individual molecules processes greatly randomized synthesis degradation occurs large bursts many molecules short time interval conversely birth death macromolecule involve several small steps creating memory individual events present generalized theory stochastic gene expression formulating variance protein abundance terms randomness individual gene expression events show common types molecular mechanisms can produce gestation senescence periods reduce noise without requiring higher abundances shorter lifetimes concentration dependent control loops also show single cell experimental methods distinguish qualitatively different stochastic principles although turn makes methods better suited identifying components introduce fluctuations characterizing random events give rise noise concentrations instead requires dynamic measurements single molecule resolution
