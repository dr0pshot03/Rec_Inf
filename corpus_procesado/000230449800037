skeleton euplectella sp: structural hierarchy nanoscale macroscale 
structural materials nature exhibit remarkable designs building blocks often hierarchically arranged nanometer macroscopic length scales report structural properties biosilica observed hexactinellid sponge euplectella sp consolidated nanometer-scaled silica spheres arranged well-defined microscopic concentric rings glued together organic matrix form laminated spicules assembly spicules bundles effected laminated silica-based cement results formation macroscopic cylindrical square-lattice cagelike structure reinforced diagonal ridges ensuing design overcomes brittleness constituent material glass shows outstanding mechanical rigidity stability mechanical benefits seven identified hierarchical levels comparison common mechanical engineering strategies discussed
