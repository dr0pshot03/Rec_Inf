pursuit clean healthy environment stimulated much effort development technologies utilization hydrogen-based energy critical issue need practical systems hydrogen storage problem remains unresolved several decades exploration context possibility storing hydrogen advanced carbon materials generated considerable interest confirmation mechanistic understanding hydrogen-storage capabilities materials still require much work- previously published work hydrogen uptake alkali-doped carbon nanotubes reproduced others- realized us also demonstrated pinkerton et al weight gain due moisture alkali oxide picked atmosphere describe different material system lithium nitride shows potential hydrogen storage medium lithium nitride usually employed electrode starting material synthesis binary ternary nitrides using variety techniques demonstrate compound can also reversibly take large amounts hydrogen although temperature required release hydrogen usable pressures high practical application present material suggest investigations needed metal-n-h system prove promising route reversible hydrogen storage
