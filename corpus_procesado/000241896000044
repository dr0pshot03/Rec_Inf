low-field magnetic separation monodisperse fe3o4 nanocrystals
magnetic separations low magnetic field gradients < tesla per meter can now applied diverse problems point-of-use water purification simultaneous separation complex mixtures high surface area monodisperse magnetite fe3o4 nanocrystals ncs shown respond low fields size-dependent fashion particles apparently act independently separation rather reversibly aggregate resulting high-field gradients present surfaces using high specific surface area fe3o4 ncs nanometers diameter reduced mass waste associated arsenic removal water orders magnitude additionally size dependence magnetic separation permitted mixtures nanometer sized fe3o4 ncs separated application different magnetic fields
