g protein subunit g alpha binds integrin alphaiibbeta mediates integrin outside-in signaling
integrins mediate cell adhesion extracellular matrix transmit signals within cell stimulate cell spreading retraction migration proliferation mechanism integrin outside-in signaling unclear found heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding protein g protein g alpha directly bound integrin beta cytoplasmic domain g alpha-integrin interaction promoted ligand binding integrin alphaiibbeta guanosine triphosphate gtp loading g alpha interference g alpha expression myristoylated fragment g alpha inhibited interaction alphaiibbeta g alpha diminished activation protein kinase c-src stimulated small guanosine triphosphatase rhoa consequently inhibiting cell spreading accelerating cell retraction conclude integrins noncanonical g alpha-coupled receptors provide mechanism dynamic regulation rhoa
