g protein subunit g alpha13 binds integrin alphaiibbeta3 mediates integrin "outside-in" signaling 
integrins mediate cell adhesion extracellular matrix transmit signals within cell stimulate cell spreading retraction migration proliferation mechanism integrin outside-in signaling unclear found heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding protein g protein g alpha13 directly bound integrin beta3 cytoplasmic domain g alpha13-integrin interaction promoted ligand binding integrin alphaiibbeta3 guanosine triphosphate gtp loading g alpha13 interference g alpha13 expression myristoylated fragment g alpha13 inhibited interaction alphaiibbeta3 g alpha13 diminished activation protein kinase c-src stimulated small guanosine triphosphatase rhoa consequently inhibiting cell spreading accelerating cell retraction conclude integrins noncanonical g alpha13-coupled receptors provide mechanism dynamic regulation rhoa
