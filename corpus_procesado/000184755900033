ice core records atmospheric n2o covering last years 
paleoatmospheric records trace-gas concentrations recovered ice cores provide important sources information many biogeochemical cycles involving carbon nitrogen oxygen present -year record atmospheric nitrous oxide n2o along corresponding isotopic records spanning last years together suggest minimal changes ratio marine terrestrial n2o production last glacial termination marine oceanic n2o emissions increased +/ % speculate records support hypotheses invoke enhanced export production explain low carbon dioxide values glacial periods
