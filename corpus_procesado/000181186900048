water transport plants obeys murrays law
optimal water transport system plants maximize hydraulic conductance proportional photosynthesis- given investment transport tissue investigate optimum may achieved performed computer simulations hydraulic conductance branched transport system show optimum network achieved commonly assumed pipe model plant form- antecedent da vincis rule representations number area xylem conduits constant every branch rank instead optimum network minimum number wide conduits base feed increasing number narrower conduits distally follows application murrays law predicts optimal taper blood vessels cardiovascular system measurements plant xylem indicate conduits conform murrays law optimum long function additionally supports plant body
