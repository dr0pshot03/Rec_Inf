epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition generates proliferative human islet precursor cells 
insulin-expressing beta cells found pancreatic islets capable generating beta cells even adult show fibroblast-like cells derived adult human islets donated postmortem proliferate readily vitro mesenchymal-type cells exhibit hormone expression can induced differentiate hormone-expressing islet-like cell aggregates reestablishes epithelial character typical islet cells immunohistochemistry situ hybridization messenger rna measurements single cells cell populations establish transition epithelial cells within islets mesenchymal cells culture insulin-expressing epithelial cells
