c-myc suppression mir-23a/b enhances mitochondrial glutaminase expression glutamine metabolism
altered glucose metabolism cancer cells termed warburg effect describes propensity cancer cells take glucose avidly convert primarily lactate despite available oxygen notwithstanding renewed interest warburg effect cancer cells also depend continued mitochondrial function metabolism specifically glutaminolysis catabolizes glutamine generate atp lactate glutamine highly transported proliferating cells major source energy nitrogen biosynthesis carbon substrate anabolic processes cancer cells regulation glutamine metabolism well understood report c-myc hereafter referred myc oncogenic transcription factor known regulate micrornas stimulate cell proliferation transcriptionally represses mir-23a mir-23b resulting greater expression target protein mitochondrial glutaminase human p b lymphoma cells pc3 prostate cancer cells leads upregulation glutamine catabolism glutaminase converts glutamine glutamate catabolized tricarboxylic acid cycle production atp serves substrate glutathione synthesis unique means myc regulates glutaminase uncovers previously unsuspected link myc regulation mirnas glutamine metabolism energy reactive oxygen species homeostasis
