earth tides can trigger shallow thrust fault earthquakes 
show correlation occurrence shallow thrust earthquakes occurrence strongest tides rate earthquakes varies background rate factor tidal stress highest correlation found assume coefficient friction mu crust although see good correlation mu results quantify effect applied stress earthquake triggering key factor understanding earthquake nucleation cascades whereby one earthquake triggers others
