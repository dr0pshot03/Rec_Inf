unexpected twist viral capsid maturation
lambda-like double-stranded ds dna bacteriophage undergo massive conformational changes capsid shell packaging viral genomes capsid shells complex organizations hundreds protein subunits assemble intricate quaternary complexes ultimately able withstand atm pressure genome packaging extensive integration subunits capsids requires formation intermediate complex termed procapsid individual subunits can undergo necessary refolding structural rearrangements needed transition stable capsid although various mature capsids characterized atomic resolution procapsid structure available dsdna virus bacteriophage present procapsid x-ray structure angstrom resolution termed prohead ii lambda-like bacteriophage hk97 mature capsid structure previously solved angstrom ref comparison two largely different capsid forms unveiled unprecedented expansion mechanism describes transition crystallographic hydrogen/deuterium exchange data presented demonstrate subunit tertiary structures significantly different two states twisting bending motions occurring helical beta-sheet regions also identified subunit interactions three-fold axis capsid maintained throughout maturation interactions sustain capsid integrity subunit refolding provide fixed hinge subunits undergo rotational translational motions maturation previously published calorimetric data closely related bacteriophage p22 showed capsid maturation exothermic process resulted release kj mol- energy propose major tertiary changes presented study reveal structural basis exothermic maturation process probably present many dsdna bacteriophage possibly viruses herpesvirus share hk97 subunit fold
