flies evade looming targets executing rapid visually directed banked turns
avoiding predators essential behavior animals must quickly transform sensory cues evasive actions sensory reflexes particularly fast flying insects flies means evade aerial predators known using high-speed videography automated tracking flies combination aerodynamic measurements flapping robots show flying flies react looming stimuli directed banked turns maneuver consists rapid body rotation followed immediately active counter-rotation enacted remarkably subtle changes wing motion evasive maneuvers flies substantially faster steering maneuvers measured previously indicate existence sensory-motor circuitry can reorient flys flight path within wingbeats
