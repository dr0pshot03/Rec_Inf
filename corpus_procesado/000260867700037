del- endogenous leukocyte-endothelial adhesion inhibitor limits inflammatory cell recruitment
leukocyte recruitment sites infection inflammation requires multiple adhesive events although numerous players promoting leukocyte endothelial interactions characterized functionally important endogenous inhibitors leukocyte adhesion identified describe endothelially derived secreted molecule del developmental endothelial locus- anti-adhesive factor interferes integrin lfa--dependent leukocyte-endothelial adhesion endothelial del deficiency increased lfa dependent leukocyte adhesion vitro vivo del--/- mice displayed significantly higher neutrophil accumulation lipopolysaccharide induced lung inflammation vivo reversed del /lfa double deficient mice thus del endogenous inhibitor inflammatory cell recruitment provide basis targeting leukocyte endothelial interactions disease
