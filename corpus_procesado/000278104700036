neural crest-derived pericytes promote egress mature thymocytes corticomedullary junction 
t cell egress thymus essential adaptive immunity yet requirements sites egress incompletely understood shown transgenic expression sphingosine--phosphate receptor- s1p1 immature thymocytes leads perivascular accumulation premature release circulation using intravascular procedure label emigrating cells found mature thymocytes exit via blood vessels corticomedullary junction deleting sphingosine kinases neural crest-derived pericytes provide evidence specialized vessel-ensheathing cells contribute s1p promotes thymic egress lymphatic endothelial cell-derived s1p required studies identify major thymic egress route suggest role pericytes promoting reverse transmigration cells across blood vessel endothelium
