neurons monkey prefrontal cortex track past predict future performance
although frontal cortex thought important controlling behavior across long periods time studies area concentrate neuronal responses instantaneously relevant current task order investigate relationship frontal activity behavior longer time periods trained rhesus monkeys difficult oculomotor task performance fluctuated day activity prefrontal neurons even measured monkeys waited targets appear beginning set trials correlated performance probabilistic rather determinist manner: neurons reflected past predicted future performance much reflected current performance suggest activity related processes arousal motivation set tone behavior rather controlling millisecond basis result ascending pathways utilize slow second-messenger synaptic processes
