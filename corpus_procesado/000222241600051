robust temporal coding trigeminal system 
ability rats use whiskers ne tactile discrimination rivals humans using fingertips rats perform discriminations rapidly accurately palpating environment whiskers suggests whisker deflections produce robust reliable neural code whisker primary afferents respond highly reproducible temporal spike patterns transient stimuli show use linear kernel reproducible response trains recorded individual neuron can reliably predict complex whisker deflections predictions significantly improved integrating responses neurons opposite angular preferences
