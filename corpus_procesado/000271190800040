genome evolution adaptation long-term experiment escherichia coli
relationship rates genomic evolution organismal adaptation remains uncertain despite considerable interest feasibility obtaining genome sequences experimentally evolving populations offers opportunity investigate relationship new precision sequence genomes sampled generations laboratory population escherichia coli although adaptation decelerated sharply genomic evolution nearly constant generations clock-like regularity usually viewed signature neutral evolution several lines evidence indicate almost mutations beneficial population later evolved elevated mutation rate accumulated hundreds additional mutations dominated neutral signature thus coupling genomic adaptive evolution complex can counterintuitive even constant environment particular beneficial substitutions surprisingly uniform time whereas neutral substitutions highly variable
