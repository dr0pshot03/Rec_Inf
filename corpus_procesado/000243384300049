evidence giant sulphur bacteria neoproterozoic phosphorites
situ phosphatization reductive cell division recently discovered within vacuolate sulphur-oxidizing bacteria show certain neoproterozoic doushantuo formation million years bp microfossils including structures previously interpreted oldest known metazoan eggs embryos- can interpreted giant vacuolate sulphur bacteria sulphur bacteria genus thiomargarita sizes morphologies similar many doushantuo microfossils including symmetrical cell clusters result multiple stages reductive division three planes also propose doushantuo phosphorite precipitation mediated bacteria shown modern thiomargarita-associated phosphogenic sites thus providing taphonomic conditions preserved fossils known doushantuo formation
