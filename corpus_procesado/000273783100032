direct measurements island growth step-edge barriers colloidal epitaxy
epitaxial growth bottom-up self-assembly process creating surface nano-and microstructures extensively studied context atoms process however also promising route self-assembly nanometer micrometer-scale particles microstructures numerous technological applications determine whether atomic epitaxial growth laws applicable epitaxy larger particles attractive interactions investigated nucleation growth dynamics colloidal crystal films single-particle resolution show quantitatively colloidal epitaxy obeys two-dimensional island nucleation growth laws govern atomic epitaxy however found colloidal epitaxy step-edge corner barriers responsible film morphology diffusive origin diffusive mechanism suggests new routes toward controlling film morphology epitaxy
