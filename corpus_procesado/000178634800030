neuroscience new insights neuron-glia communication 
two-way communication neurons nonneural cells called glia essential axonal conduction synaptic transmission information processing thus required normal functioning nervous system development throughout adult life signals neurons glia include ion fluxes neurotransmitters cell adhesion molecules specialized signaling molecules released synaptic nonsynaptic regions neuron contrast serial flow information along chains neurons glia communicate glial cells intracellular waves calcium via intercellular diffusion chemical messengers releasing neurotransmitters extracellular signaling molecules glia can affect neuronal excitability synaptic transmission perhaps coordinate activity across networks neurons
