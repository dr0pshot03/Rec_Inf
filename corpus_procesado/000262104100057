signal sequences activate catalytic switch srp rna
signal recognition particle srp recognizes polypeptide chains bearing signal sequence emerge ribosome binds membrane associated receptor sr thereby delivering ribosome nascent chain complex endoplasmic reticulum eukaryotic cells plasma membrane prokaryotic cells srp rna catalytically accelerates interaction srp sr stimulates guanosine triphosphatase gtpase activities leading dissociation complex found although catalytic activity srp rna appeared constitutive srp rna accelerated complex formation srp bound signal sequence crucial control step obscured detergent commonly included reaction buffer acted signal peptide mimic thus srp rna molecular switch renders srp sr gtpase engine responsive signal peptide recruitment coupling gtp hydrolysis productive protein targeting
