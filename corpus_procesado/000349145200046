inflammation-induced disruption scs macrophages impairs b cell responses secondary infection
layer macrophages subcapsular sinus scs captures pathogens entering lymph node preventing global dissemination triggering immune response however infection affects scs macrophages remains largely unexplored show infection inflammation disrupt organization scs macrophages manner involves migration mature dendritic cells lymph node disrupted organization reduces capacity scs macrophages retain present antigen subsequent secondary infection resulting diminished b cell responses thus scs macrophage layer may act sensor valve infection temporarily shut lymph node antigenic challenge shutdown may increase organisms susceptibility secondary infections
