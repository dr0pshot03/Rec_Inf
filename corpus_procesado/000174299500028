protein folding molecular chaperones cytosol: nascent chain folded protein
efficient folding many newly synthesized proteins depends assistance molecular chaperones serve prevent protein misfolding aggregation crowded environment cell nascent chain-binding chaperones including trigger factor hsp70 prefoldin stabilize elongating chains ribosomes nonaggregated state folding cytosol achieved either controlled chain release factors transfer newly synthesized proteins downstream chaperones chaperonins large cylindrical complexes provide central compartment single protein chain fold unimpaired aggregation understanding thousands different proteins synthesized cell use chaperone machinery profound implications biotechnology medicine
