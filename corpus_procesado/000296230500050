brca1 tumor suppression depends brct phosphoprotein binding e3 ligase activity
germline mutations breast cancer brca1 gene major cause familial breast ovarian cancer brca1 protein displays e3 ubiquitin ligase activity enzymatic function thought required tumor suppression test hypothesis generated mice express enzymatically defective brca1 found mutant brca1 prevents tumor formation degree wild-type brca1 three different genetically engineered mouse gem models cancer contrast mutation ablates phosphoprotein recognition brca c terminus brct domains brca1 elicits tumors three gem models thus brct phosphoprotein recognition e3 ligase activity required brca1 tumor suppression
