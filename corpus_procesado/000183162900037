class compact dwarf galaxies disruptive processes galaxy clusters
dwarf galaxies attracted increased attention recent years susceptibility galaxy transformation processes within rich galaxy clusters- direct evidence processes however difficult obtain small number diffuse light trails intra-cluster stars signs galaxy disruption furthermore current knowledge dwarf galaxy populations may incomplete traditional galaxy surveys insensitive extremely diffuse compact galaxies aware concerns recently undertook all-object survey fornax galaxy cluster revealed new population compact members overlooked previous conventional surveys demonstrate ultra-compact dwarf galaxies structurally dynamically distinct globular star clusters known types dwarf galaxy thus represent new class dwarf galaxy data consistent interpretation remnant nuclei disrupted dwarf galaxies making easily observed tracer galaxy disruption
