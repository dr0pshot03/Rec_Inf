unfolded protein response: stress pathway homeostatic regulation
vast majority proteins cell secretes displays surface first enter endoplasmic reticulum er fold assemble properly assembled proteins advance er cell surface ascertain fidelity protein folding cells regulate protein-folding capacity er according need er responds burden unfolded proteins lumen er stress activating intracellular signal transduction pathways collectively termed unfolded protein response upr together least three mechanistically distinct branches upr regulate expression numerous genes maintain homeostasis er induce apoptosis er stress remains unmitigated recent advances shed light mechanistic complexities role upr numerous diseases
