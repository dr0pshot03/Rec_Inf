storage retrieval single photons transmitted remote quantum memories 
elementary quantum network operation involves storing qubit state atomic quantum memory node retrieving transporting information single photon excitation remote quantum memory node storage analysis implementations quantum network operations thus conditioned ability realize matter-to-light and/or light-to-matter quantum state mappings report generation transmission storage retrieval single quanta using two remote atomic ensembles single photon generated cold atomic ensemble one site directed another site metres optical fibre photon converted single collective atomic excitation using dark-state polariton approach2 programmable storage time atomic excitation converted back single photon demonstrated experimentally storage time microseconds measurement anti-correlation parameter storage times exceeding ten microseconds observed intensity cross-correlation measurements storage period two orders magnitude longer time required achieve conversion photonic atomic quanta controlled transfer single quanta remote quantum memories constitutes important step towards distributed quantum networks
