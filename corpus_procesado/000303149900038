new understanding decoding principle ribosome 
protein synthesis ribosome accurately selects transfer rnas trnas accordance messenger rna mrna triplet decoding centre trna selection initiated elongation factor tu delivers trna aminoacyl trna-binding site site hydrolyses gtp upon establishing codon-anticodon interactions decoding centre- following proofreading step ribosome re-examines trna rejects match codon- suggested universally conserved g530 a1492 a1493 16s ribosomal rna critical trna binding asite- actively monitor cognate trna recognition correct codon-anticodon duplex induces overall ribosome conformational change domain closure propose integrated mechanism decoding based six x-ray structures 70s ribosome determined -4a resolution modelling cognate near-cognate states decoding centre proofreading step show 30s subunit undergoes identical domain closure upon binding either cognate near-cognate trna conformational change 30s subunit forms decoding centre constrains mrna way first two nucleotides codon limited form watson-crick base pairs u center dot g g center dot u mismatches generally considered form wobble base pairs first second codon-anticodon position decoding centre forces pair adopt geometry close canonical c center dot g pair distortions codon-anticodon mini-helix anticodon loop causes near-cognate trna dissociate ribosome
