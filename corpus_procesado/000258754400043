redox-active antibiotics control gene expression community behavior divergent bacteria 
thought bacteria excrete redox active pigments antibiotics inhibit competitors pseudomonas aeruginosa endogenous antibiotic pyocyanin activates soxr transcription factor conserved proteo actinobacteria escherichia coli soxr regulates superoxide stress response bioinformatic analysis coupled gene expression studies p aeruginosa streptomyces coelicolor revealed majority soxr regulons bacteria lack genes required stress responses despite fact many organisms still produce redox active small molecules indicates redox active pigments play role independent oxidative stress compounds profound effects structural organization colony biofilms p aeruginosa s coelicolor shows "secondary metabolites" play important conserved roles gene expression development
