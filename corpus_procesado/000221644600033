electric polarization reversal memory multiferroic material induced magnetic fields
ferroelectric magnetic materials time-honoured subject study led important technological advances date magnetism ferroelectricity involved local spins off-centre structural distortions respectively two seemingly unrelated phenomena can coexist certain unusual materials termed multiferroics- despite possible coexistence ferroelectricity magnetism pronounced interplay properties rarely observed prevented realization multiferroic devices offering functionality report striking interplay ferroelectricity magnetism multiferroic tbmn2o5 demonstrated highly reproducible electric polarization reversal permanent polarization imprint actuated applied magnetic field results point new device applications magnetically recorded ferroelectric memory
