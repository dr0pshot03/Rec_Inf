formation asteroid pairs rotational fission 
pairs asteroids sharing similar heliocentric orbits bound together found recently- backward integrations orbits indicated separated gently low relative velocities provide additional insight formation mechanism previously hypothesized rotational fission process may explain formation-critical predictions mass ratios less mass ratio approaches upper limit spin period larger body becomes long report photometric observations sample asteroid pairs revealing primaries pairs mass ratios much less rotate rapidly near critical fission frequency mass ratio approaches primary period grows long occurs total energy system approaches zero requiring asteroid pair extract increasing fraction energy primarys spin order escape find asteroid pairs mass ratios larger rotationally fissioned systems beyond limit insufficient energy disrupt conclude asteroid pairs formed rotational fission parent asteroid proto-binary system subsequently disrupts internal system dynamics soon formation
