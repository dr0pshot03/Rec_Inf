trpv3 temperature-sensitive vanilloid receptor-like protein
vanilloid receptor vr1 also known trpv1 thermosensitive nonselective cation channel expressed capsaicin-sensitive sensory afferents activated noxious heat acidic ph alkaloid irritant capsaicin although vr1 gene disruption results loss capsaicin responses minimal effects thermal nociception experiments-such showing existence capsaicin-insensitive heat sensors sensory neurons-suggest existence thermosensitive receptors distinct vr1 identify member vanilloid receptor/trp gene family vanilloid receptor-like protein vrl3 also known trpv3 heat-sensitive capsaicin-insensitive vrl3 coded -base-pair open reading frame transcribed gene adjacent vr1 structurally homologous vr1 vrl3 responds noxious heat threshold degreesc co-expressed dorsal root ganglion neurons vr1 furthermore heterologously expressed vrl3 able associate vr1 may modulate responses hence vrl3 thermosensitive ion channel may represent additional vanilloid receptor subunit involved formation heteromeric vanilloid receptor channels
