acetylcholine-synthesizing t cells relay neural signals vagus nerve circuit 
neural circuits regulate cytokine production prevent potentially damaging inflammation prototypical vagus nerve circuit inflammatory reflex inhibits tumor necrosis factor-alpha production spleen mechanism requiring acetylcholine signaling alpha nicotinic acetylcholine receptor expressed cytokine-producing macrophages nerve fibers spleen lack enzymatic machinery necessary acetylcholine production; therefore neural circuit terminate cholinergic signaling identified acetylcholine-producing memory phenotype t cell population mice integral inflammatory reflex acetylcholine-producing t cells required inhibition cytokine production vagus nerve stimulation thus action potentials originating vagus nerve regulate t cells turn produce neurotransmitter acetylcholine required control innate immune responses
