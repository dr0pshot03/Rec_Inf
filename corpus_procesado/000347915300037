vaccine-elicited cd4 t cells induce immunopathology chronic lcmv infection 
cd4 t cells promote innate adaptive immune responses vaccine-elicited cd4 t cells contribute immune protection remains unclear evaluated whether induction virus-specific cd4 t cells vaccination protect mice infection chronic lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus lcmv immunization vaccines selectively induced cd4 t cell responses resulted catastrophic inflammation mortality challenge persistent strain lcmv immunopathology required antigen-specific cd4 t cells associated cytokine storm generalized inflammation multi-organ system failure virus-specific cd8 t cells antibodies abrogated pathology data demonstrate vaccine-elicited cd4 t cells absence effective antiviral immune responses can trigger lethal immunopathology
