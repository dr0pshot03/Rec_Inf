phenotypic robustness conferred apparently redundant transcriptional enhancers
genes include cis-regulatory regions contain transcriptional enhancers recent reports shown developmental genes often possess multiple discrete enhancer modules drive transcription similar spatio-temporal patterns-: primary enhancers located near basal promoter secondary shadow enhancers located remote positions proposed seemingly redundant activity primary secondary enhancers contributes phenotypic robustness tested hypothesis generating deficiency removes two newly discovered enhancers shavenbaby svb transcript ovo locus gene encoding transcription factor directs development drosophila larval trichomes optimal temperatures embryonic development deficiency causes minor defects trichome patterning embryos develop low high extreme temperatures however absence secondary enhancers leads extensive loss trichomes temperature-dependent defects can rescued transgene carrying secondary enhancer driving transcription svb cdna finally removal one copy wingless gene required normal trichome patterning causes similar loss trichomes flies lacking secondary enhancers results support hypothesis secondary enhancers contribute phenotypic robustness face environmental genetic variability
