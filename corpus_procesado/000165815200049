mu-opioid receptor desensitization beta-arrestin- determines morphine tolerance dependence 
morphine powerful pain reliever also potent inducer tolerance dependence development opiate tolerance occurs continued use drug amount drug required elicit pain relief must increased compensate diminished responsiveness1- many systems decreased responsiveness agonists correlated desensitization g-protein-coupled receptors vitro evidence indicates process involves phosphorylation g-protein-coupled receptors subsequent binding regulatory proteins called beta arrestins45 using knockout mouse lacking beta arrestin- beta arr2-/- assessed contribution desensitization mu opioid receptor development morphine antinociceptive tolerance subsequent onset physical dependence show mice lacking beta arrestin- desensitization mu opioid receptor occur chronic morphine treatment animals fail develop antinociceptive tolerance however deletion beta arrestin- prevent chronic morphine-induced upregulation adenylyl cyclase activity cellular marker dependence mutant mice still become physically dependent drug
