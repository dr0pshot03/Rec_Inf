characterizing cancer genome lung adenocarcinoma 
somatic alterations cellular dna underlie almost human cancers prospect targeted therapies development high-resolution genome-wide approaches- now spurring systematic efforts characterize cancer genomes report large-scale project characterize copy-number alterations primary lung adenocarcinomas analysis large collection tumours n using dense single nucleotide polymorphism arrays identify total significantly recurrent events find autosomal chromosome arms show consistent large-scale copy-number gain loss handful linked specific gene also identify recurrent focal events including amplifications homozygous deletions six focal events currently associated known mutations lung carcinomas common event amplification chromosome 14q13 found similar % samples basis genomic functional analyses identify nkx2 nk2 homeobox also called titf1 lies minimal 14q13 amplification interval encodes lineage-specific transcription factor novel candidate proto-oncogene involved significant fraction lung adenocarcinomas generally results indicate many genes involved lung adenocarcinoma remain discovered
