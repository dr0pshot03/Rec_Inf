positive supercoiling mitotic dna drives decatenation topoisomerase ii eukaryotes
dna topoisomerase ii completely removes dna intertwining catenation sister chromatids segregated cell division occurs throughout genome poorly understood demonstrate yeast centromeric plasmids undergo dramatic change topology cells pass mitosis change characterized positive supercoiling dna requires mitotic spindles condensin factor smc2 mitotic positive supercoiling occurs decatenated dna rapidly relaxed topoisomerase ii however positive supercoiling takes place catenated plasmid topoisomerase ii activity directed toward decatenation molecules relaxation thus topological change dna drives topoisomerase ii decatenate molecules mitosis potentially driving full decatenation genome
