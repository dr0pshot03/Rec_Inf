three-dimensional structure determination single view
ability determine structure matter three dimensions profoundly advanced understanding nature traditionally widely used schemes three-dimensional 3d structure determination object implemented acquiring multiple measurements various sample orientations case crystallography tomography scanning series thin sections sample confocal microscopy present 3d imaging modality termed ankylography derived greek words ankylos meaning curved graphein meaning writing certain circumstances enables complete 3d structure determination single exposure using monochromatic incident beam demonstrate diffraction pattern finite object sampled sufficiently fine scale ewald sphere 3d structure object principle determined 2d spherical pattern confirm theoretical analysis performing 3d numerical reconstructions sodium silicate glass structure angstrom resolution single poliovirus 3nm resolution 2d spherical diffraction patterns alone using diffraction data soft x-ray laser also provide preliminary demonstration ankylography experimentally feasible obtaining 3d image test object single 2d diffraction pattern development approach obtaining complete 3d structure information single view find broad applications physical life sciences
