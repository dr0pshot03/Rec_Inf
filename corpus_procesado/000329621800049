icosahedral bacteriophage phi x174 forms tail dna transport infection
prokaryotic viruses evolved various mechanisms transport genomes across bacterial cell walls many bacteriophages use tail perform function whereas tail-less phages rely host organelles- however tail-less icosahedral single-stranded dna phi x174-like coliphages fall well-defined infection processes phages dna delivery requires dna pilot protein show phi x174 pilot protein h oligomerizes forma tube whose function probably deliver dna genome across hosts periplasmic space cytoplasm angstrom resolution crystal structure vitro assembled h proteins central domain consists angstrom-long alpha-helical barrel tube constructed ten alpha-helices amino termini arrayed right-handed super-helical coiled-coil carboxy termini arrayed left-handed super-helical coiled-coil genetic biochemical studies demonstrate tube essential infectivity affect vivo virus assembly cryo-electron tomograms show tubes span periplasmic space present genome delivered host cells cytoplasm ends h protein contain transmembrane domains anchor assembled tubes inner outer cell membranes central channel h-protein tube lined amide guanidinium side chains may general property viral dna conduits likely critical efficient genome translocation host
