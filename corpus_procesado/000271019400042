cdc20-apc ubiquitin signaling pathway regulates presynaptic differentiation 
presynaptic axonal differentiation essential synapse formation establishment neuronal circuits however mechanisms coordinate presynaptic development brain largely unknown found major mitotic e3 ubiquitin ligase cdc20-anaphase promoting complex cdc20-apc regulates presynaptic differentiation primary postmitotic mammalian neurons rat cerebellar cortex cdc20-apc triggered degradation transcription factor neurod2 thereby promoted presynaptic differentiation neurod2 target gene encoding complexin ii acts locally presynaptic sites mediated ability neurod2 suppress presynaptic differentiation thus findings define cdc20-apc ubiquitin signaling pathway governs presynaptic development holds important implications neuronal connectivity plasticity brain
