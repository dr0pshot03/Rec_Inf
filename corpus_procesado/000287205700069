proteome half-life dynamics living human cells 
cells remove proteins two processes: degradation dilution due cell growth balance basic processes poorly understood addressed developing accurate noninvasive method measuring protein half-lives called bleach-chase applicable fluorescently tagged proteins assaying proteins living human cancer cells showed half-lives ranged minutes hours variety stresses stop cell division showed general effect: long-lived proteins became longer-lived whereas short-lived proteins remained largely unaffected effect due relative strengths degradation dilution suggests mechanism differential killing rapidly growing cells growth-arresting drugs approach opens way understand proteome half-life dynamics living cells
