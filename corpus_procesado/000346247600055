predicting immunogenic tumour mutations combining mass spectrometry exome sequencing 
human tumours typically harbour remarkable number somatic mutations1 presented major histocompatibility complex class molecules mhci peptides containing mutations potentially immunogenic recognized non-self neo-antigens adaptive immune system recent work confirmed mutant peptides can serve t-cell epitopes however mutant epitopes described discovery required laborious screening patient tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes ability recognize antigen libraries constructed following tumour exome sequencing sought simplify discovery immunogenic mutant peptides characterizing general properties developed approach combines whole-exome transcriptome sequencing analysis mass spectrometry identify neo-epitopes two widely used murine tumour models > amino acid changes identified % predicted bind mh ci small fraction confirmed mass spectrometry peptides structurally modelled bound mhci mutations solvent-exposed therefore accessible t-cell antigen receptors predicted immunogenic vaccination mice confirmed approach predicted immunogenic peptide yielding therapeutically active t-cell responses predictions also enabled generation peptide-mhci dextramers used monitor kinetics distribution anti-tumour t-cell response vaccination findings indicate suitable prediction algorithm may provide approach pharmacodynamic monitoring t-cell responses well development personalized vaccines cancer patients
