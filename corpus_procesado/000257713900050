signal-mediated dynamic retention glycosyltransferases golgi
golgi-resident glycosyltransferases family enzymes sequentially modify glycoproteins subcompartment-specific manner type ii integral membrane proteins characterized short cytoplasmically exposed amino-terminal tail luminal enzymatic domain cytoplasmic tails play role localization glycosyltransferases coat protein complex copi vesicle-mediated retrograde transport also involved golgi localization however tails enzymes lack known copi-binding motifs found vps74p bound pentameric motif present cytoplasmic tails majority yeast golgi-localized glycosyltransferases well copi propose vps74p maintains steady-state localization golgi glycosyltransferases dynamically promoting incorporation copi-coated vesicles
