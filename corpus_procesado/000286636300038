methylaspartate cycle haloarchaea 
access novel ecological niches often requires adaptation metabolic pathways cope new environments conversion cellular building blocks many substrates enter central carbon metabolism via acetyl-coenzyme acetyl-coa now two pathways identified: glyoxylate cycle ethylmalonyl-coa pathway prokaryotes haloarchaea use third pathway acetyl-coa oxidized glyoxylate via key intermediate methylaspartate glyoxylate condensation another acetyl-coa molecule yields malate final assimilation product cycle combines reactions originally belonged different metabolic processes different groups prokaryotes suggests lateral gene transfer evolutionary tinkering acetate assimilation moreover requires elevated intracellular glutamate concentrations well coupling carbon assimilation nitrogen metabolism
