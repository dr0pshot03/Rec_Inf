photonic spin hall effect metasurfaces
spin hall effect light weak extremely small photon momentum spin-orbit interaction report strong photonic resulting measured large splitting polarized light metasurfaces rapidly varying phase discontinuities along metasurface breaking axial symmetry system enable direct observation large transverse motion circularly polarized light even normal incidence strong spin-orbit interaction deviates polarized light trajectory prescribed ordinary fermat principle strong broadband photonic may provide route exploiting spin orbit angular momentum light information processing communication
