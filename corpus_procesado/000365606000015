comparison diagnostics detection asymptomatic plasmodium falciparum infections inform control elimination strategies 
global burden malaria substantially reduced past two decades future efforts reduce malaria will require moving beyond treatment clinical infections targeting malaria transmission broadly community accurate identification asymptomatic human infections can sustain large proportion transmission becoming vital component control elimination programmes determined relationship across common diagnostics used measure malaria prevalence polymerase chain reaction pcr rapid diagnostic test microscopy detection plasmodium falciparum infections endemic populations based pooled analysis cross-sectional data included data individuals comparing detection rapid diagnostic test microscopy detection rapid diagnostic test pcr analysis showed average rapid diagnostic tests detected % % confidence interval -% pcr-positive infections data comparison rapid diagnostic test pcr detection high transmission intensity adults sparse prevalence measured rapid diagnostic test microscopy comparable although rapid diagnostic test detected slightly infections microscopy average microscopy captured % % confidence interval -% rapid diagnostic test-positive infections extent higher rapid diagnostic test detection reflects increased sensitivity lack specificity unclear contribution asymptomatic individuals infectious reservoir better defined future analyses ideally establish optimal detection limits new diagnostics use control elimination strategies
