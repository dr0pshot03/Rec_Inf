cell cycle regulation central spindle assembly 
bipolar mitotic spindle responsible segregating sister chromatids anaphase microtubule motor proteins generate spindle bipolarity enable spindle perform mechanical work major change spindle architecture occurs anaphase onset central spindle assembly begins structure regulates initiation cytokinesis essential completion central spindle assembly requires central-spindlin complex composed caenorhabditis elegans zen mammalian orthologue mklp1 kinesin-like protein rho family gap cyk mgcracgap describe regulatory mechanism controls timing central spindle assembly mitotic kinase cdk1/cyclin b phosphorylates motor domain zen conserved site within basic amino-terminal extension characteristic mklp1 subfamily phosphorylation cdk1 diminishes motor activity zen reducing affinity microtubules preventing cdk1 phosphorylation zen-/mklp1 causes enhanced metaphase spindle localization defects chromosome segregation thus phosphoregulation motor domain mklp1 kinesin ensures central spindle assembly occurs appropriate time cell cycle maintains genomic stability
