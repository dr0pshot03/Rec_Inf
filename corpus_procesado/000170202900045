habitat structure population persistence experimental community 
understanding spatial population dynamics fundamental many questions ecology conservation- many theoretical mechanisms proposed whereby spatial structure can promote population persistence particular exploiter-victim systems host-parasite/pathogen predator-prey whose interactions inherently oscillatory therefore prone extinction local populations- experiments confirmed spatial structure can extend persistence- rarely possible identify specific mechanisms involved use model-based approach identify effects spatial population processes experimental systems bean plants phaseolus lunatus herbivorous mites tetranychus urticae predatory mites phytoseiulus persimilis isolated plants spatially undivided experimental system plants prey predator populations collapsed however introducing habitat structure allowed long-term persistence using mechanistic models determine spatial population structure contribute persistence spatially explicit models needed rather habitat structure reduced success predators locating prey outbreaks allowing between-plant asynchrony local population cycles due random colonization events
