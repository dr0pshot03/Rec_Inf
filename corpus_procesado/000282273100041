selectivity mechanism nuclear pore complex characterized single cargo tracking
nuclear pore complex npc mediates exchange cytoplasm nucleus small molecules can passively diffuse npc whereas larger cargos require transport receptors translocate npc facilitates translocation transport receptor/cargo complexes remains unclear investigate process tracked single protein-functionalized quantum dot cargos moved human npcs show import proceeds successive substeps comprising cargo capture filtering translocation release nucleus quantum dots rejected one steps return cytoplasm including large cargos abort size-selective barrier cargo movement central channel subdiffusive cargos can bind transport receptors diffuse freely without ran gtpase critical regulator transport directionality cargos still explore entire npc markedly reduced probability exit nucleus suggesting npc entry exit steps equivalent pore functionally asymmetric importing cargos overall selectivity npc seems arise cumulative action multiple reversible substeps final irreversible exit step
