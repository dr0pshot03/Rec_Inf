npy/agrp neurons essential feeding adult mice can ablated neonates 
hypothalamic neurons express neuropeptide y npy agouti-related protein agrp thought critical regulators feeding behavior body weight determine whether npy/agrp neurons essential mice targeted human diphtheria toxin receptor agrp locus allows temporally controlled ablation npy/agrp neurons occur injection diphtheria toxin neonatal ablation npy/agrp neurons minimal effects feeding whereas ablation adults caused rapid starvation results suggest network-based compensatory mechanisms can develop ablation npy/agrp neurons neonates readily occur neurons become essential adults
