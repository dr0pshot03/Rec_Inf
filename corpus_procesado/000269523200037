fundamental evolutionary limits ecological traits drive drosophila species distributions
species habitat specialists make much biodiversity evolutionary factors limit distributions rarely considered show drosophila narrow wide ranges desiccation cold resistance closely associated distributions specialist generalist species respectively furthermore data show narrowly distributed tropical species consistently low means low genetic variation traits compared widely distributed species phylogenetic correction results unrelated levels neutral variation thus specialist species may simply lack genetic variation key traits limiting ability adapt conditions beyond current range predict species likely constrained evolutionary responses future climate changes
