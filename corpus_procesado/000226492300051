cryo-electron tomography reveals cytoskeletal structure spiroplasma melliferum 
evidence accumulated recently eukaryotes also bacteria can cytoskeleton used cryo-electron tomography study three-dimensional structure spiroplasma melliferum cells close-to-native state similar to4-nanometer resolution showed cells possess two types filaments arranged three parallel ribbons underneath cell membrane two filamentous structures built fibril protein possibly actin-like protein mreb basis structural data model motility modes cells explain helical mollicutes can propel means coordinated length changes cytoskeletal ribbons
