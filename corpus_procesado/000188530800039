reactivation paternal x chromosome early mouse embryos 
generally accepted paternally imprinted x inactivation occurs exclusively extraembryonic lineages mouse embryos whereas cells embryo proper derived inner cell mass icm undergo random x inactivation show imprinted x inactivation fact occurs cells early embryos paternal x selectively reactivated cells allocated icm contrasts differentiated cell types x inactivation highly stable generally irreversible observations illustrate important component genome plasticity early development capacity reverse heritable gene silencing decisions
