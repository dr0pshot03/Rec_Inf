common mass scaling satellite systems gaseous planets
solar systems outer planets contain hydrogen gas host systems multiple moons notably contain similar fraction respective planets mass similar - mass fraction two three orders magnitude smaller largest satellites solid planets earths moon common value gas planets puzzling model satellite growth loss forming giant planet accumulates gas rock-ice solids solar orbit find mass fraction satellite system regulated similar - balance two competing processes: supply inflowing material satellites satellite loss orbital decay driven gas show overall properties satellite systems jupiter saturn uranus arise naturally suggest similar processes limit largest moons extrasolar jupiter-mass planets moon-to-mars size
