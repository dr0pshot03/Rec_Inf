initial mass function stars: evidence uniformity variable systems
distribution stellar masses form one star formation event given volume space called initial mass function imf imf estimated low-mass brown dwarfs massive stars combining imf estimates different populations stars can observed individually unveils extraordinary uniformity imf general insight appears hold populations including present-day star formation small molecular clouds rich dense massive star-clusters forming giant clouds ancient metal-poor exotic stellar populations may dominated dark matter apparent universality imf challenge star formation theory elementary considerations suggest imf systematically vary star-forming conditions
