dynamic magnetic tension force cause failed solar eruptions 
coronal mass ejections solar eruptions driven sudden release magnetic energy stored suns corona1 many cases magnetic energy stored long-lived arched structures called magnetic flux ropes2- flux rope destabilizes can either erupt produce coronal mass ejection fail collapse back towards sun6- prevailing belief outcome given event determined magnetohydrodynamic force imbalance called torus instability9- belief challenged however observations indicating torus-unstable flux ropes sometimes fail erupt15 contradiction yet resolved lack coronal magnetic field measurements limitations idealized numerical modelling report results laboratory experiment16 reveal previously unknown eruption criterion torus-unstable flux ropes fail erupt find failed torus events occur guide magnetic field ambient field runs toroidally along flux rope strong enough prevent flux rope kinking conditions guide field interacts electric currents flux rope produce dynamic toroidal field tension force halts eruption magnetic tension force missing existing eruption models models explain predict failed torus events
