dynamic magnetic tension force cause failed solar eruptions
coronal mass ejections solar eruptions driven sudden release magnetic energy stored suns corona many cases magnetic energy stored long-lived arched structures called magnetic flux ropes- flux rope destabilizes can either erupt produce coronal mass ejection fail collapse back towards sun- prevailing belief outcome given event determined magnetohydrodynamic force imbalance called torus instability- belief challenged however observations indicating torus-unstable flux ropes sometimes fail erupt contradiction yet resolved lack coronal magnetic field measurements limitations idealized numerical modelling report results laboratory experiment reveal previously unknown eruption criterion torus-unstable flux ropes fail erupt find failed torus events occur guide magnetic field ambient field runs toroidally along flux rope strong enough prevent flux rope kinking conditions guide field interacts electric currents flux rope produce dynamic toroidal field tension force halts eruption magnetic tension force missing existing eruption models models explain predict failed torus events
