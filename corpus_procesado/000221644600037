predator diversity dampens trophic cascades
food web complexity thought weaken strength terrestrial trophic cascades- strong impacts natural enemies herbivores cascade influence primary production indirectly predator diversity can enhance food web complexity predators may feed shared prey- cases theory suggests impact predation herbivores relaxes cascading effects basal resources dampened despite view empirical studies explicitly investigated role predator diversity mediating primary productivity natural terrestrial system compare coastal marsh community impacts arthropod predators herbivores plant productivity simple food web single predator species complex food web diverse predator assemblage show enhancing predator diversity dampens enemy effects herbivores weakens trophic cascades consequently changes diversity higher trophic levels can significantly alter ecosystem function natural systems
