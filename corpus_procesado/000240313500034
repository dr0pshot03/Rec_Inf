anomalous spiral motion steps near dislocations silicon surfaces 
used low-energy electron microscopy measure step motion si111 si001 near dislocations growth sublimation steps si111 exhibit classic rotating archimedean spiral motion predicted burton cabrera frank steps si001 however move strikingly different manner anomalous behavior can understood detail considering local step velocity affected nonuniform strain field arising dislocation show dynamic step-flow pattern related dislocation slip system
