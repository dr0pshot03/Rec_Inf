crispr-cas immunity prokaryotes
prokaryotic organisms threatened large array viruses developed numerous defence strategies among clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat crispr-cas systems provide adaptive immunity foreign elements upon viral injection small sequence viral genome known spacer integrated crispr locus immunize host cell spacers transcribed small rna guides direct cleavage viral dna cas nucleases immunization spacer acquisition enables unique form evolution whereby population rapidly acquires resistance predators also passes resistance mechanism vertically progeny
