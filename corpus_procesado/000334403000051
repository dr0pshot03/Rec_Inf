apical constriction drives tissue-scale hydrodynamic flow mediate cell elongation
epithelial folding mediated apical constriction converts flat epithelial sheets multilayered complex tissue structures used throughout development inmost animals little known however forces produced near apical surface tissue transmitted within individual cells generate global changes cell shape characterize tissue deformation apply particle tracking velocimetry gastrulating drosophila embryos measure movement cytoplasm plasma membrane ventral furrow formation find cytoplasmic redistribution lengthening phase ventral furrow formation can precisely described viscous flows quantitatively match predictions hydrodynamics cell membranes move ambient cytoplasm little resistance driving force flow strikingly apical constriction produces similar flow patterns mutant embryos fail form cells gastrulation acellular embryos global redistribution cytoplasm mirrors summed redistribution occurring individual cells wild-type embryos results indicate lengthening phase ventral furrow formation hydrodynamic behaviour cytoplasm provides predominant mechanism transmitting apically generated forces deep tissue cell individualization dispensable
