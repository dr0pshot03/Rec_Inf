membrane fusion intermediates via directional full assembly snare complex 
cellular membrane fusion thought proceed intermediates including docking apposed lipid bilayers merging proximal leaflets form hemifusion diaphragm fusion pore opening membrane-bridging four-helix complex soluble n-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors snares mediates fusion however assembly snare complex generates docking fusion intermediates unknown using cell-free reaction identified intermediates visually arrested snare fusion machinery fusion begin partial directional assembly snares tightly docked bilayers efficient fusion extended form hemifusion required assembly beyond core complex membrane-connecting linkers propose straining lipids edges extended docking zone initiates fusion
