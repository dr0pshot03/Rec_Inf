protein nanoarrays generated dip-pen nanolithography 
dip-pen nanolithography used construct arrays proteins -nanometer features nanoarrays exhibit almost detectable nonspecific binding proteins passivated portions even complex mixtures proteins therefore provide opportunity study variety surface-mediated biological recognition processes example reactions involving protein features antigens complex solutions can screened easily atomic force microscopy proof-of-concept arrays used study cellular adhesion submicrometer scale
