thinning flow tibetan crust constrained seismic anisotropy 
intermediate-period rayleigh love waves propagating across tibet indicate marked radial anisotropy within middle-to-lower crust consistent thinning middle crust % anisotropy largest western part plateau moment tensors earthquakes indicate active crustal thinning preferred orientation mica crystals resulting crustal thinning can account observed anisotropy middle-to-lower crust tibet appears thinned upper crust consistent deformation mechanically weak layer flows confined channel
