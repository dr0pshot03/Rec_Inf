regulation dna replication fork progression damaged dna mec1/rad53 checkpoint
checkpoint kinase proteins mec1 rad53 required budding yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae maintain cell viability presence drugs causing damage dna arrest dna replication forks- thought act inhibiting cell cycle progression allowing time dna repair take place mec1 rad53 also slow s phase progression response dna alkylation although mechanism relative importance protecting cells dna damage determined show dna-alkylating agent methyl methanesulphonate mms profoundly reduces rate dna replication fork progression however moderation require rad53 mec1 accelerated s phase checkpoint mutants therefore primarily consequence inappropriate initiation events- wild-type cells ultimately complete dna replication presence mms contrast replication forks checkpoint mutants collapse irreversibly high rates moreover cytotoxicity mms checkpoint mutants occurs specifically cells allowed enter s phase dna damage thus preventing damage-induced dna replication fork catastrophe seems primary mechanism checkpoints preserve viability face dna alkylation
