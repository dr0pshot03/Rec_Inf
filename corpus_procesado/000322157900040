attention enhances synaptic efficacy signal-to-noise ratio neural circuits 
attention critical component perception1 however mechanisms attention modulates neuronal communication guide behaviour poorly understood elucidate synaptic mechanisms attention developed sensitive assay attentional modulation neuronal communication alert monkeys performing visual spatial attention task probed thalamocortical communication electrically stimulating neurons lateral geniculate nucleus thalamus simultaneously recording shock-evoked responses monosynaptically connected neurons primary visual cortex found attention enhances neuronal communication increasing efficacy presynaptic input driving postsynaptic responses increasing synchronous responses among ensembles postsynaptic neurons receiving independent input decreasing redundant signals postsynaptic neurons receiving common input results demonstrate attention finely tunes neuronal communication synaptic level selectively altering synaptic weights enabling enhanced detection salient events noisy sensory environment
