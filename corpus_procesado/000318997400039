3d computational imaging single-pixel detectors
computational imaging enables retrieval spatial information object use single-pixel detectors projecting series known random patterns measuring backscattered intensity possible reconstruct two-dimensional 2d image used several single-pixel detectors different locations capture 3d form object detector derived 2d image appeared illuminated different direction even though single digital projector used illumination shading images surface gradients derived 3d object reconstructed compare result obtained stereophotogrammetric system using multiple cameras simplified approach 3d imaging can readily extended nonvisible wavebands
