long-term strength europe implications plate-forming processes
field-based geological studies show continental deformation preferentially occurs young tectonic provinces rather old cratons partitioning deformation suggests cratons stronger surrounding younger phanerozoic provinces however although archaean phanerozoic lithosphere differ thickness- composition relative strength matter much debate one proxy strength effective elastic thickness lithosphere t-e unfortunately spatial variations t-e well understood different methods yield different results differences apparent cratons bouguer coherence method yields large t-e values > km- whereas free-air admittance method yields low values < km present estimates variability t-e europe using methods show consistently formulated methods yield comparable t-e values correlate geology strength old lithosphere > gyr old much larger mean t-e > km younger lithosphere mean t-e < km propose strength difference reflects changes lithospheric plate structure thickness geothermal gradient composition result mantle temperature volatile content decrease earths history
