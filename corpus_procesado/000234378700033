abrupt reversal ocean overturning palaeocene/eocene warm period 
exceptional analogue study causes consequences global warming occurs palaeocene/ eocene thermal maximum million years ago rapid rise global temperatures event accompanied turnovers marine- terrestrial biota well significant changes ocean chemistry circulation present evidence abrupt shift deep-ocean circulation using carbon isotope records fourteen sites records indicate deep-ocean circulation patterns changed southern hemisphere overturning northern hemisphere overturning start palaeocene/ eocene thermal maximum shift location deep-water formation persisted least years eventually recovered original circulation patterns results corroborate climate model inferences shift deep-ocean circulation deliver relatively warmer waters deep sea thus producing warming greenhouse conditions can thus initiate abrupt deep-ocean circulation changes less thousand years may lasting effects case taking years revert background conditions
