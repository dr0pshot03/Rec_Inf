grid cells without theta oscillations entorhinal cortex bats
grid cells provide neural representation space discharging animal traverses vertices periodic hexagonal grid spanning environment although grid cells characterized detail rats- fundamental question neural dynamics give rise grid structure remains unresolved two competing classes models proposed: network models based attractor dynamics- oscillatory interference models propose interference somatic dendritic theta-band oscillations hz single neurons transforms temporal oscillation spatially periodic grid- far models dissociated experimentally rodent grid cells always co-exist continuous theta oscillations- used novel animal model egyptian fruit bat refute proposed causal link grids theta oscillations basis previous finding bat hippocampus spatially tuned place cells absence continuous theta oscillations hypothesized grid cells bat medial entorhinal cortex might also exist without theta oscillations indeed found grid cells bat medial entorhinal cortex shared remarkable similarities rodent grid cells notably grids existed absence continuous theta-band oscillations almost theta modulation grid-cell spiking-both essential prerequisites oscillatory interference models results provide direct demonstration grid cells non-rodent species furthermore strongly argue major class computational models grid cells
