metabolic gene regulation dynamically changing environment 
natural selection dictates cells constantly adapt dynamically changing environments context dependent manner gene regulatory networks often mediate cellular response perturbation1- understanding cellular adaptation will require experimental approaches aimed subjecting cells dynamic environment mimics natural habitat4- monitor response saccharomyces cerevisiae metabolic gene regulation periodic changes external carbon source using microfluidic platform allows precise dynamic control environmental conditions show metabolic system acts low pass filter reliably responds slowly changing environment effectively ignoring fast fluctuations sensitive low frequency response significantly faster predictions arising computational modelling discrepancy resolved discovery two key galactose transcripts possess half lives depend carbon source finally explore induction characteristics affect frequency response compare two s cerevisiae strains show frequency response despite markedly different induction properties suggests although certain characteristics complex networks may differ probed static environment system optimized robust response dynamically changing environment
