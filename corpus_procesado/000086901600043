surprising simplicity protein folding
polypeptide chains make proteins thousands atoms hence millions possible inter-atomic interactions might supposed resulting complexity make prediction protein structure protein-folding mechanisms nearly impossible fundamental physics underlying folding may much simpler complexity lead us expect: folding rates mechanisms appear largely determined topology native folded state new methods shown great promise predicting protein-folding mechanisms three-dimensional structures proteins
