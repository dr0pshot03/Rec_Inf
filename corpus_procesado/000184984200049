s-phase checkpoint proteins tof1 mrc1 form stable replication-pausing complex 
checkpoint regulatory mechanism important role maintaining integrity genome1- particularly important s phase cell cycle genomic dna susceptible various environmental hazards367 chemical agents damage dna activation checkpoint signalling pathways results temporary cessation dna replication replication-pausing complex believed created arrested forks activate checkpoint cascades leading repair damaged dna thus checkpoint factors thought act arrest replication also maintain stable replication complex replication forks6- however molecular mechanism coupling checkpoint regulation replication arrest unknown demonstrate checkpoint regulatory proteins tof1 mrc1 interact directly dna replication machinery saccharomyces cerevisiae hydroxyurea blocks chromosomal replication assembly forms stable pausing structure serves anchor subsequent dna repair events
