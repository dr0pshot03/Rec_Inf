low coseismic shear stress tohoku-oki megathrust determined laboratory experiments 
large coseismic slip thought unlikely occur shallow portions plate-boundary thrusts march tohoku-oki earthquake [moment magnitude m-w ] produced huge displacements similar meters near japan trench resultant devastating tsunami investigate mechanisms large fault movements conducted high-velocity meters per second friction experiments samples retrieved plate-boundary thrust associated earthquake results show small stress drop low peak steady-state shear stress low shear stress can attributed abundance weak clay smectite thermal pressurization effects can facilitate fault slip behavior provides explanation huge shallow slip occurred earthquake
