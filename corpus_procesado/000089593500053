failure regulate tnf-induced nf-kappa b cell death responses a20-deficient mice 
a20 cytoplasmic zinc finger protein inhibits nuclear factor kappa b nf-kappa b activity tumor necrosis factor tnf-mediated programmed cell death pcd tnf dramatically increases a20 messenger rna expression tissues mice deficient far a20 develop severe inflammation cachexia hypersensitive lipopolysaccharide tnf die prematurely a20-deficient cells fail terminate tnf-induced nf-kappa b responses cells also susceptible control cells undergo tnf-mediated pcd thus azo critical limiting inflammation terminating tnf-induced nf-kappa b responses vivo
