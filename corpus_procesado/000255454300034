structure dynamics earths lower mantle 
processes within lowest several hundred kilometers earths rocky mantle play critical role evolution planet understanding earths lower mantle requires putting recent seismic mineral physics discoveries self consistent geodynamically feasible context two nearly antipodal large low shear velocity provinces deep mantle likely represent chemically distinct denser material high resolution seismological studies revealed laterally varying seismic velocity discontinuities deepest hundred kilometers consistent phase transition perovskite post perovskite deepest tens kilometers mantle isolated pockets ultralow seismic velocities may denote earths deepest magma chamber
