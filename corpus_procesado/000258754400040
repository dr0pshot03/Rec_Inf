weak interplate coupling seamounts repeating m similar earthquakes
subducting seamounts thought increase normal stress subducting overriding plates however recent seismic surveys laboratory experiments suggest interplate coupling weak seismic survey japan trench shows large seamount subducted near region repeating earthquakes magnitude m similar observed seismicity pattern rupture propagation m event imply interplate coupling weak seamount large rupture area small slip occurred front seamount northern bound determined trace multiple subducted seamounts whereas subducted seamount may define rupture area width may influenced seamount
