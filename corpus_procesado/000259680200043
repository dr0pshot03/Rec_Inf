rates molecular evolution linked life history flowering plants 
variable rates molecular evolution documented across tree life cause observed variation within among clades remains uncertain plants suggested life history traits correlated rate molecular evolution previous studies yielded conflicting results exceptionally large phylogenies five major angiosperm clades demonstrate rates molecular evolution consistently low trees shrubs relatively long generation times compared related herbaceous plants generally shorter generation times herbs show much higher rates molecular change also much higher variance rates correlates life history attributes long interest biologists results demonstrate changes rate molecular evolution linked life history traits can affect measurements tempo evolution well ability identify conserve biodiversity
