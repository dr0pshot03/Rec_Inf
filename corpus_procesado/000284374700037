probing ultimate limit fiber-optic strain sensing 
measurement relative displacements deformations important many fields structural engineering aerospace geophysics nanotechnology optical-fiber sensors become key tools strain measurements sensitivity limits ranging - -6epsilon hertz hz-/ epsilon fractional length change report strain measurements -13epsilon-hz-/ level using fiber bragg-grating resonator diode-laser source stabilized quartz-disciplined optical frequency comb thus approaching detection limits set thermodynamic phase fluctuations fiber scheme may provide route new generation strain sensors entirely based fiber-optic systems aimed measuring fundamental physical quantities; example gyroscopes accelerometers gravity experiments
