rna branching debranching yeast retrovirus-like element ty1
ty elements saccharomyces cerevisiae long terminal repeat ltr retroelements related retroviruses normal levels ty1 transposition require dbr1p cellular enzyme cleaves - rna bonds show ty1 rnas lacking identifiable ends accumulate virus-like particles vlps dbr1 mutants debranching rna vitro dbr1p creates uncapped version normal ty1 rna end show nucleotide nt ty1 rna forms - bond nt near end rna creating lariat properties lariat suggest forms novel mechanism branching debranching may play roles ty1 reverse transcription minus-strand transfer step
