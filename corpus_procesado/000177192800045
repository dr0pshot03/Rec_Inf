beaming light subwavelength aperture 
light usually diffracts directions emerges subwavelength aperture puts lower limit size features can used photonics limitation can overcome creating periodic texture exit side single aperture metal film transmitted light emerges aperture beam small angular divergence approximately +/-3degrees whose directionality can controlled finding especially surprising considering radiating region mainly confined area lateral dimensions comparable wavelength light device occupies one cubic micrometer combined enhanced transmission suggests wide range photonic applications possible
