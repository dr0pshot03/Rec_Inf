genome-scale transcriptional activation engineered crispr-cas9 complex 
systematic interrogation gene function requires ability perturb gene expression robust generalizable manner describe structure-guided engineering crispr-cas9 complex mediate efficient transcriptional activation endogenous genomic loci used engineered cas9 activation complexes investigate single-guide rna sgrna targeting rules effective transcriptional activation demonstrate multiplexed activation ten genes simultaneously upregulate long intergenic non-coding rna lincrna transcripts also synthesized library consisting guides targeting human refseq coding isoforms screen genes upon activation confer resistance braf inhibitor top hits included genes previously shown able confer resistance novel candidates validated using individual sgrna complementary dna overexpression gene expression signature based top screening hits correlated markers braf inhibitor resistance cell lines patient-derived samples results collectively demonstrate potential cas9-based activators powerful genetic perturbation technology
