highly siderophile elements earths mantle clock moon-forming impact
according generally accepted scenario last giant impact earth formed moon initiated final phase core formation melting earths mantle key goal geochemistry date event different ages proposed some- argue early moon-forming event approximately million years myr condensation first solids solar system whereas others- claim date later myr possibly late around myr condensation show moon-forming event myr condensation earlier ruled per cent confidence level use large number n-body simulations demonstrate relationship time last giant impact earth-like planet amount mass subsequently added era known late accretion last giant impact delayed late-accreted mass decreases predictable fashion relationship exists within classical scenario grand tack scenario terrestrial planet formation holds across wide range disk conditions concentration highly siderophile elements hses earths mantle constrains mass chondritic material added earth late accretion using hse abundance measurements determine moon-formation age +/ myr condensation possibility exists late projectiles differentiated left incomplete hse record earths mantle even case various isotopic constraints strongly suggest late-accreted mass exceed per cent earths mass hse clock still robustly limits timing moon-forming event significantly later myr condensation
