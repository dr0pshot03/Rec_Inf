impact-induced seismic activity asteroid eros: surface modification process
high-resolution images surface asteroid eros revealed evidence downslope movement loose regolith layer well degradation erasure small impact craters less similar to100 meters diameter one hypothesis explain observations seismic reverberation impact events used combination seismic geomorphic modeling analyze response regolith-covered topography particularly craters impact-induced seismic shaking applying results stochastic cratering model surface eros produced good agreement observed size-frequency distribution craters including paucity small craters
