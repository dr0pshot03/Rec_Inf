persistent currents normal metal rings
quantum mechanics predicts equilibrium state resistive metal ring will contain dissipationless current persistent current focus considerable theoretical experimental work basic properties remain topic controversy main experimental challenges studying persistent currents small signals produce exceptional sensitivity environment developed technique detecting persistent currents allows us measure persistent current metal rings wide range temperatures ring sizes magnetic fields measurements single ring arrays rings agree well calculations based model non-interacting electrons
