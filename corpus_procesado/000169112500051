defects mismatch repair promote telomerase-independent proliferation 
mismatch repair central role maintaining genomic stability repairing dna replication errors inhibiting recombination non-identical homeologous sequences defects mismatch repair linked certain human cancers including hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer hnpcc sporadic tumours- crucial requirement tumour cell proliferation maintenance telomere length tumours achieve reactivating telomerase yeast human cells however telomerase-independent telomere maintenance can occur result recombination-dependent exchanges often imperfectly matched telomeric sequences- show loss mismatch-repair function promotes cellular proliferation absence telomerase defects mismatch repair including mutations correspond amino-acid changes recovered hnpcc tumours enhance telomerase-independent survival saccharomyces cerevisiae related budding yeast degree telomere sequence homology similar human telomeres results indicate enhanced telomeric recombination human cells mismatch-repair defects may contribute cell immortalization hence tumorigenesis
