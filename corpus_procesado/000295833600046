early gamma oscillations synchronize developing thalamus cortex
development formation topographic maps sensory cortex requires precise temporal binding thalamocortical networks however physiological substrate synchronization unknown report early gamma oscillations egos enable precise spatiotemporal thalamocortical synchronization neonatal rat whisker sensory system driven thalamic gamma oscillator initially independent cortical inhibition egos synchronize neurons single thalamic barreloid corresponding cortical barrel support plasticity developing thalamocortical synapses propose multiple replay sensory input thalamocortical circuits egos allows thalamic cortical neurons organized vertical topographic functional units development horizontal binding adult brain
