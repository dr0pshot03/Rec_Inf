reconstruction initial conditions universe optimal mass transportation
reconstructing density fluctuations early universe evolved distribution galaxies see today challenge modern cosmology accurate reconstruction allow us test cosmological models simulating evolution starting reconstructed primordial state comparing observations several reconstruction techniques proposed- suffer lack uniqueness velocities needed produce unique reconstruction usually known show reconstruction can reduced well-determined problem optimization present specific algorithm provides excellent agreement tested data n-body simulations applying algorithm redshift surveys now way will able recover reliably properties primeval fluctuation field local universe determine accurately peculiar velocities deviations hubble expansion true positions many galaxies feasible method
