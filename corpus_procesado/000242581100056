thermal radiation scanning tunnelling microscopy 
standard near-field scanning optical microscopy nsom subwavelength probe acts optical stethoscope map near field produced sample surface external illumination technique applied using visible infrared terahertz gigahertz radiation illuminate sample providing resolution well beyond diffraction limit nsom well suited study surface waves surface plasmons surface-phonon polaritons using aperture nsom visible laser illumination near-field interference pattern around corral structure observed whose features similar scanning tunnelling microscope image electronic waves quantum corral describe infrared nsom operates without external illumination: near-field analogue night-vision camera making use thermal infrared evanescent fields emitted surface behaves optical scanning tunnelling microscope therefore term instrument thermal radiation scanning tunnelling microscope trstm show first trstm images thermally excited surface plasmons demonstrate spatial coherence effects near-field thermal emission
