scaffold proteins: hubs controlling flow cellular information
spatial temporal organization molecules within cell critical coordinating many distinct activities carried cell increasing number biological signaling processes scaffold proteins found play central role physically assembling relevant molecular components although scaffolds use simple tethering mechanism increase efficiency interaction individual partner molecules proteins can also exert complex allosteric control partners target regulation scaffold proteins offer simple flexible strategy regulating selectivity pathways shaping output behaviors achieving new responses preexisting signaling components result scaffold proteins exploited evolution pathogens cellular engineers reshape cellular behavior
