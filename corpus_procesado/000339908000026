convergence terrestrial plant production across global climate gradients 
variation terrestrial net primary production npp climate thought originate direct influence temperature precipitation plant metabolism however variation npp may also result indirect influence climate means plant age stand biomass growing season length local adaptation identify relative importance direct indirect climate effects extend metabolic scaling theory link hypothesized climate influences npp assess hypothesized relationships using global compilation ecosystem woody plant biomass production data notably age biomass explained variation production whereas temperature precipitation explained almost none suggesting climate indirectly directly influences production furthermore theory shows variation npp characterized common scaling relationship suggesting global change models can incorporate mechanisms governing relationship improve predictions future ecosystem function
