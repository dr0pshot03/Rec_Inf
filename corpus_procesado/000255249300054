metabolic diversification independent assembly operon-like gene clusters different plants 
operons clusters unrelated genes related functions feature prokaryotic genomes report operon like gene cluster plant arabidopsis thaliana required triterpene synthesis thalianol pathway clustered genes coexpressed bacterial operons however despite resemblance bacterial operon gene cluster assembled plant genes gene duplication neofunctionalization genome reorganization rather horizontal gene transfer bacteria furthermore recent assembly operon like gene clusters triterpene synthesis occurred independently divergent plant lineages arabidopsis oat thus selection pressure may act formation certain plant metabolic pathways drive gene clustering
