development cd8 alpha-positive dendritic cells common myeloid progenitor 
dendritic cells dcs critical initiating adaptive immune responses maintaining tolerance self antigens apparently contradictory roles suggested depend different subsets dcs arise either myeloid lymphoid hematopoietic origins respectively although dc expression cd8 alpha attributed lymphoid origin show cd8 alpha + cd8 alpha - dcs can arise clonogenic common myeloid progenitors thymus spleen thus expression cd8 alpha indicative lymphoid origin phenotypic functional differences among dc subsets likely reflect maturation status rather ontogeny
