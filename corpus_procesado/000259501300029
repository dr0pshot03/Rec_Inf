core signaling pathways human pancreatic cancers revealed global genomic analyses 
currently therapeutic options patients pancreatic cancer new insights pathogenesis lethal disease urgently needed toward end performed comprehensive genetic analysis pancreatic cancers first determined sequences transcripts representing protein-coding genes samples searched homozygous deletions amplifications tumor dna using microarrays containing probes similar single nucleotide polymorphisms found pancreatic cancers contain average genetic alterations majority point mutations alterations defined core set cellular signaling pathways processes genetically altered % tumors analysis tumors transcriptomes next generation sequencing synthesis technologies provided independent evidence importance pathways processes data indicate genetically altered core pathways regulatory processes become evident coding regions genome analyzed depth dysregulation core pathways processes mutation can explain major features pancreatic tumorigenesis
