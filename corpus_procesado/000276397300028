quantum spin liquid emerging two-dimensional correlated dirac fermions
sufficiently low temperatures condensed-matter systems tend develop order notable exception behaviour case quantum spin liquids quantum fluctuations prevent transition ordered state lowest temperatures now tentative observations states two-dimensional organic compounds yet quantum spin liquids remain elusive microscopic two-dimensional models relevant experiments show means large-scale quantum monte carlo simulations correlated fermions honeycomb lattice structure realized example graphene quantum spin liquid emerges state described massless dirac fermions antiferromagnetically ordered mott insulator unexpected quantum-disordered state found short-range resonating valence-bond liquid akin one proposed high-temperature superconductors: possibility unconventional superconductivity doping therefore arises system foresee experimental realization model system using ultra-cold atoms group iv elements arranged honeycomb lattices
