darwinian evolution can follow mutational paths fitter proteins
five point mutations particular beta-lactamase allele jointly increase bacterial resistance clinically important antibiotic factor similar principle evolution high-resistance beta-lactamase might follow mutational trajectories linking alleles however demonstrate trajectories inaccessible darwinian selection many remaining trajectories negligible probabilities realization four five mutations fail increase drug resistance combinations pervasive biophysical pleiotropy within beta-lactamase seems responsible pleiotropy appears general property missense mutations conclude much protein evolution will similarly constrained implies protein tape life may largely reproducible even predictable
