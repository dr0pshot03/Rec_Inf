redox signaling chloroplasts: cleavage disulfides iron-sulfur cluster 
light generates reducing equivalents chloroplasts used carbon reduction also regulation activity chloroplast enzymes reduction regulatory disulfides via ferredoxin:thioredoxin reductase ftr system ftr key electron/thiol transducer enzyme pathway unique can reduce disulfides iron-sulfur cluster property explained tight contact active-site disulfide iron-sulfur center thin flat ftr molecule makes two-electron reduction possible forming one side mixed disulfide thioredoxin providing opposite side access ferredoxin delivering electrons
