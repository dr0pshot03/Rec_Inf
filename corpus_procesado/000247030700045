dscam2 mediates axonal tiling drosophila visual system
sensory processing centres vertebrate invertebrate brain often organized reiterated columns thus facilitating internal topographic representation external world cells within column arranged stereotyped fashion form precise patterns synaptic connections within discrete layers connections largely confined single column thereby preserving spatial information periphery neurons integrate information connecting multiple columns restricting axons columns conceptually similar tiling axons dendrites neighbouring neurons class use tiling form complete yet non-overlapping receptive fields- thought molecular level cell-surface proteins mediate tiling contact-dependent repulsive interactions proteins serving function yet identified show immunoglobulin superfamily member dscam2 restricts connections formed l1 lamina neurons columns drosophila visual system data support model dscam2 homophilic interactions mediate repulsion neurites l1 cells neighbouring columns propose dscam2 tiling receptor l1 neurons
