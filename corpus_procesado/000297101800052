silica-like malleable materials permanent organic networks
permanently cross-linked materials outstanding mechanical properties solvent resistance processed reshaped synthesized non-cross-linked polymers reversible cross-links processable soluble designed epoxy networks can rearrange topology exchange reactions without depolymerization showed insoluble processable unlike organic compounds polymers whose viscosity varies abruptly near glass transition networks show arrhenius-like gradual viscosity variations like vitreous silica like silica materials can wrought welded make complex objects local heating without use molds concept glass made reversible topology freezing epoxy networks can readily scaled applications generalized chemistries
