bipedal dna brownian motor coordinated legs 
substantial challenge engineering molecular motors designing mechanisms coordinate motion multiple domains motor bias random thermal motion bipedal motors challenge takes form coordinating movement bipeds legs can move synchronized fashion address problem constructed autonomous dna bipedal walker coordinates action two legs cyclically catalyzing hybridization metastable dna fuel strands process leads chemically ratcheted walk along directionally polar dna track covalently cross-linking aliquots walker track successive walking states demonstrate brownian motor can complete full walking cycle track whose length extended longer walks believe study helps uncover principles behind design unidirectional devices can function without intervention device able fulfill roles entail performance useful mechanical work nanometer scale
