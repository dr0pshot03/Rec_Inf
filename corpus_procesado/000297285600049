earliest evidence anatomically modern humans northwestern europe 
earliest anatomically modern humans europe thought appeared around - calendar years present - kyr cal bp association aurignacian sites lithic assemblages assumed made modern humans rather neanderthals however actual physical evidence modern humans extremely rare direct dates reach farther back - kyr cal bp leaving gap show using stratigraphic chronological archaeological data fragment human maxilla kents cavern site uk dates earlier period maxilla kc4 excavated initially diagnosed upper palaeolithic modern human1 directly radiocarbon dated accelerator mass spectrometry - kyr cal bp2 using bayesian analysis new ultrafiltered bone collagen dates ordered stratigraphic sequence site show date considerable underestimate instead kc4 dates - kyr cal bp makes older equivalently dated modern human specimen directly contemporary latest european neanderthals thus making taxonomic attribution crucial also show dental traits kc4 possesses modern human rather neanderthal characteristics; three traits show neanderthal affinities seven ambiguous kc4 therefore represents oldest known anatomically modern human fossil northwestern europe fills key gap earliest dated aurignacian remains earliest human skeletal remains demonstrates wide rapid dispersal early modern humans across europe kyr ago
