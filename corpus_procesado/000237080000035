high-redshift galaxy populations 
now see many galaxies million years big bang limit may soon exceeded wide-field infrared detectors widely available multi-wavelength studies show relatively little star formation early times star formation maximum half age universe small number high-redshift objects found targeting x-ray radio sources recently gamma-ray bursts gamma-ray burst sources may provide way reach even higher-redshift galaxies future probe first generation stars
