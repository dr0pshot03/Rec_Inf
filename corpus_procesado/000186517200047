dna damage checkpoint response telomere-initiated senescence
human somatic cells can undergo limited number population doublings vitro exhaustion proliferative potential called senescence can triggered telomeres ends linear chromosomes-cannot fulfil normal protective functions show senescent human fibroblasts display molecular markers characteristic cells bearing dna double-strand breaks markers include nuclear foci phosphorylated histone h2ax co-localization dna repair dna damage checkpoint factors 53bp1 mdc1 nbs1 also show senescent cells contain activated forms dna damage checkpoint kinases chk1 chk2 furthermore chromatin immunoprecipitation whole-genome scanning approaches show chromosome ends senescent cells directly contribute dna damage response uncapped telomeres directly associate many dna damage response proteins finally show inactivation dna damage checkpoint kinases senescent cells can restore cell-cycle progression s phase thus propose telomere-initiated senescence reflects dna damage checkpoint response activated direct contribution dysfunctional telomeres
