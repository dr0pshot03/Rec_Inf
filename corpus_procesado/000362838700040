opposing intrinsic temporal gradients guide neural stem cell production varied neuronal fates
neural stem cells show age-dependent developmental potentials evidenced production distinct neuron types different developmental times drosophila neuroblasts produce long stereotyped lineages neurons searched factors regulate neural temporal fate rna-sequencing lineage-specific neuroblasts various developmental times found two rna-binding proteins igf-ii mrna-binding protein imp syncrip syp display opposing high-to-low low-to-high temporal gradients lineage-specific temporal dynamics imp syp promote early late fates respectively slowly progressing rapidly changing lineage imp syp control neuronal fates mushroom body lineages regulating temporal transcription factor chinmo translation together opposing imp/syp gradients encode stem cell age specifying multiple cell fates within lineage
