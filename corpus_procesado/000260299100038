direct imaging reconstructed atoms tio surfaces 
determining atomic structures oxide surfaces critical understanding physical chemical properties also challenging breaking atomic bonds formation surface termination can involve complex reconstructions used advanced transmission electron microscopy directly observe atomic structure reduced titania tio surfaces directions parallel surface direct atomic-resolution images reconstructed titanium atoms top surface layer clearly imaged found occupy interstitial sites tio structure combining observations two orthogonal directions three-dimensional positioning ti interstitials identified atomic dimensions allows resolution two previous models differ oxygen stoichiometries
