requirement ror gamma thymocyte survival lymphoid organ development
developing thymocytes undergo apoptosis interact productively molecules encoded major histocompatibility complex show mice lacking orphan nuclear hormone receptor ror gamma lose thymic expression anti-apoptotic factor bcl-xl ror gamma thus regulates survival cd4++ thymocytes may control temporal window thymocytes can undergo positive selection ror gamma also required development lymph nodes peyers patches splenic follicles absence loss population cd3-cd4+cd45+ cells normally express ror gamma likely early progenitors lymphoid organs hence ror gamma critical functions t cell repertoire selection lymphoid organogenesis
