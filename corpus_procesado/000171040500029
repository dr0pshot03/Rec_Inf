controlling photons using electromagnetically induced transparency
well known dielectric medium can used manipulate properties light pulses however optical absorption limits extent possible control: especially important weak light pulses absorption opaque medium can eliminated via quantum mechanical interference effect known electromagnetically induced transparency theoretical experimental work demonstrated phenomenon can used slow light pulses dramatically even bring complete halt interactions photons atomic medium can many orders magnitude stronger conventional optical materials
