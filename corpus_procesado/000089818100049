bacterial toxin controls cell cycle progression deoxyribonuclease i-like protein 
many bacterial pathogens encode multisubunit toxin termed cytolethal distending toxin cdt induces cell cycle arrest cytoplasm distention eventually chromatin fragmentation cell death one pathogen campylobacter jejuni one subunits toxin cdtb shown exhibit features type deoxyribonucleases transient expression subunit cultured cells caused marked chromatin disruption microinjection low amounts cdtb induced cytoplasmic distention cell cycle arrest cdtb mutants substitutions residues equivalent required catalysis magnesium binding type deoxyribonucleases cause chromatin disruption cdt holotoxin containing mutant forms cdtb induce morphological changes cell cycle arrest
