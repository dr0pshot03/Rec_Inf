gene-specific control inflammation tlr-induced chromatin modifications 
toll-like receptors tlrs induce multi-component inflammatory response must tightly regulated avoid tissue damage known regulatory mechanisms target tlr signalling pathways thus broadly inhibit multiple aspects inflammatory response given functional diversity tlr-induced genes proposed additional gene-specific regulatory mechanisms exist allow individual aspects tlr-induced response differentially regulated using vitro system lipopolysaccharide tolerance murine macrophages show tlr-induced genes fall two categories basis functions regulatory requirements demonstrate representatives two classes acquire distinct patterns tlr-induced chromatin modifications gene-specific chromatin modifications associated transient silencing one class genes includes pro-inflammatory mediators priming second class includes antimicrobial effectors findings illustrate adaptive response macrophages reveal component-specific regulation inflammation
