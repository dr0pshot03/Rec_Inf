rna viruses can hijack vertebrate micrornas suppress innate immunity
currently little evidence notable role vertebrate microrna mirna system pathogenesis rna viruses primarily attributed ease viruses mutate disrupt recognition growth suppression host mirnas report haematopoietic-cell-specific mirna mir--3p potently restricts replication mosquito-borne north american eastern equine encephalitis virus myeloid-lineage cells binding sites non-translated region rna genome however limiting myeloid cell tropism consequent innate immunity induction restriction directly promotes neurologic disease manifestations characteristic eastern equine encephalitis virus infection humans furthermore region containing mir--3p binding sites essential efficient virus infection mosquito vectors propose rna viruses can adapt use antiviral properties vertebrate mirnas limit replication particular cell types restriction can lead exacerbation disease severity
