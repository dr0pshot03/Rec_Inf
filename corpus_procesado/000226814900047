kaposin b protein kshv activates p38/mk2 pathway stabilizes cytokine mrnas
cytokine production plays critical role diseases caused kaposis sarcoma-associated herpesvirus kshv show latent kshv gene product kaposin b increases expression cytokines blocking degradation messenger rnas mrnas cytokine transcripts normally unstable contain au-rich elements ares noncoding regions target degradation kaposin b reverses instability binding activating kinase mk2 target p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway known inhibitor are-mrna decay findings define important mechanism linking latent kshv infection cytokine production also illustrate distinctive mode viruses can selectively modulate mrna turnover
