essential cell cycle regulation gene causes hybrid inviability drosophila
speciation process new biological species arise involves evolution reproductive barriers hybrid sterility inviability populations however identifying hybrid incompatibility genes remains key obstacle understanding molecular basis reproductive isolation devised genomic screen identified cell cycle-regulation gene cause male inviability hybrids resulting cross drosophila melanogaster d simulans ablation d simulans allele gene sufficient rescue adult viability hybrid males dominantly acting cell cycle regulator causes mitotic arrest thereby inviability male hybrid larvae genomic method provides facile means accelerate identification hybrid incompatibility genes model nonmodel systems
