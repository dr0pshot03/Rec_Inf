mechanoelectrical transduction adult outer hair cells studied gerbil hemicochlea
sensory receptor cells mammalian cochlea morphologically functionally dichotomized inner hair cells transmit auditory information brain whereas outer hair cells ohc amplify mechanical signal transduced inner hair cells amplification ohcs probably mediated somatic motility mechanical feedback process ohc motility vivo thought driven cells receptor potential first steps towards generation receptor potential deflection stereociliary bundle subsequent flow transducer current mechanosensitive transducer channels located tips quantitative relations transducer currents basilar membrane displacements lacking well variation along cochlear length address simultaneously recorded ohc transducer currents receptor potentials basilar membrane motion excised bisected cochlea hemicochlea preparation permits recordings adult ohcs various cochlear locations basilar membrane mechanically stimulated furthermore stereocilia deflected means stimulation vivo show asymmetrical transducer currents receptor potentials significantly larger previously thought possess highly restricted dynamic range strongly depend cochlear location
