sympatric speciation palms oceanic island
origin species diversity challenged biologists two centuries allopatric speciation divergence species resulting geographical isolation well documented however sympatric speciation divergence without geographical isolation highly controversial claims sympatric speciation must demonstrate species sympatry sister relationships reproductive isolation earlier allopatric phase highly unlikely provide clear support sympatric speciation case study two species palm arecaceae oceanic island large dated phylogenetic tree shows two species howea endemic remote lord howe island sister taxa diverged well island formed million years ago fieldwork found substantial disjunction flowering time correlated soil preference addition genome scan indicates genetic loci divergent two species expected neutrality finding consistent models sympatric speciation involving disruptive/ divergent selection case study sympatric speciation plants provides opportunity refining theoretical models origin species new impetus exploring putative plant animal examples oceanic islands
