gun4 regulator chlorophyll synthesis intracellular signaling 
nuclear genes control plastid differentiation response developmental signals environmental signals retrograde signals plastids return plastids emit signals essential proper expression many nuclear photosynthetic genes accumulation magnesium-protoporphyrin ix mg-proto intermediate chlorophyll biosynthesis plastid signal represses nuclear transcription signaling pathway arabidopsis requires gun4 gene gun4 binds product substrate mg-chelatase enzyme produces mg-proto activates mg-chelatase thus gun4 participates plastid-to-nucleus signaling regulating mg-proto synthesis trafficking
