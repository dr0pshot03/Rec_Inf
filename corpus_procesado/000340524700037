varying planetary heat sink led global-warming slowdown acceleration
vacillating global heat sink intermediate ocean depths associated different climate regimes surface warming anthropogenic forcing: latter part 20th century saw rapid global warming heat stayed near surface 21st century surface warming slowed heat moved deeper oceans situ reanalyzed data used trace pathways ocean heat uptake addition shallow la nina-like patterns pacific previous focus found slowdown mainly caused heat transported deeper layers atlantic southern oceans initiated recurrent salinity anomaly subpolar north atlantic cooling periods associated latter deeper heat-sequestration mechanism historically lasted years
