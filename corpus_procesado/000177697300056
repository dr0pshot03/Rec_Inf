geographic range size determinants avian species richness
geographic patterns species richness mainly based wide-ranging species larger number distribution records disproportionate contribution species richness counts demonstrate effect strongly influences understanding determines species richness using conventional spatial regression models show sub-saharan african birds apparent role productivity diminishes decreasing range size whereas significance topographic heterogeneity increases relative importance geometric constraints continental edge moderate findings highlight failure traditional species richness models account narrow-ranging species frequently also threatened
