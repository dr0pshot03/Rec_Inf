disentangling nestedness models ecological complexity
complex networks interactions ubiquitous particularly important ecological communities large numbers species exhibit negative example competition predation positive example mutualism interactions one another nestedness mutualistic ecological networks tendency ecological specialists interact subset species also interact generalist species recent mathematical computational analysis suggested nestedness increases species richness examining previous results applying computational approaches empirical data sets representing mutualistic plant-pollinator networks show statement incorrect simpler metric-the number mutualistic partners species has-is much better predictor individual species survival hence community persistence nestedness best secondary covariate rather causative factor biodiversity mutualistic communities analysis complex networks accompanied analysis simpler underpinning mechanisms drive multiple higher-order network properties
