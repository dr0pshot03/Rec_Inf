terahertz metamaterial unnaturally high refractive index
controlling electromagnetic properties materials going beyond limit attainable naturally existing substances become reality advent metamaterials- range various structured artificial atoms promised vast variety otherwise unexpected physical phenomena- among experimental realization negative refractive index one main foci thus far expanding refractive index high positive regime will complete spectrum achievable refractive index provide design flexibility transformation optics- naturally existing transparent materials possess small positive indices refraction except semiconductors insulators lead sulphide strontium titanate exhibit rather high peak refractive index mid far-infrared frequencies previous approaches using metamaterials successful realizing broadband high refractive indices- broadband high-refractive-index metamaterial structure theoretically investigated recently proposed structure lend easy implementation demonstrate broadband extremely high index refraction can realized large-area free-standing flexible terahertz metamaterials composed strongly coupled unit cells drastically increasing effective permittivity strong capacitive coupling decreasing diamagnetic response thin metallic structure unit cell peak refractive index along low-frequency quasi-static value experimentally realized single-layer terahertz metamaterial maintaining low losses natural extension single-layer metamaterials fabricated quasi-three-dimensional high-refractive-index metamaterials obtained maximum bulk refractive index along value around quasi-static limit
