fusion bone-marrow-derived cells purkinje neurons cardiomyocytes hepatocytes
recent studies suggested bone marrow cells possess broad differentiation potential able form new liver cells cardiomyocytes neurons several groups attributed apparent plasticity transdifferentiation- others however suggested cell fusion explain results- using simple method based cre/lox recombination detect cell fusion events demonstrate bone-marrow-derived cells bmdcs fuse spontaneously neural progenitors vitro furthermore bone marrow transplantation demonstrates bmdcs fuse vivo hepatocytes liver purkinje neurons brain cardiac muscle heart resulting formation multinucleated cells evidence transdifferentiation without fusion observed tissues observations provide first vivo evidence cell fusion bmdcs neurons cardiomyocytes raising possibility cell fusion may contribute development maintenance key cell types
