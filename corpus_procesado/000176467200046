ongoing modification mediterranean pleistocene sapropels mediated prokaryotes 
late pleistocene organic-rich sediments sapropels eastern mediterranean sea harbor unknown metabolically active chemoorganotrophic prokaryotes compared carbon-lean intermediate layers sapropels exhibit elevated cell numbers increased activities hydrolytic exoenzymes increased anaerobic glucose degradation rates suggesting microbial carbon substrates originate sapropel layers years old s ribosomal rna gene analyses revealed as-yet-uncultured green nonsulfur bacteria constitute % total microbial biomass crenarchaeota constitute smaller fraction average % slow significant turnover glucose detected apparently sapropels still altered metabolic activity green nonsulfur bacteria crenarchaeota
