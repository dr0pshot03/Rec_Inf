ring life provides evidence genome fusion origin eukaryotes 
genomes hold within record evolution life earth genome fusions horizontal gene transfer seem obscured sufficiently gene sequence record difficult reconstruct phylogenetic tree life determine general outline tree using complete genome data representative prokaryotes eukaryotes new genome analysis method makes possible reconstruct ancient genome fusions phylogenetic trees analyses indicate eukaryotic genome resulted fusion two diverse prokaryotic genomes therefore deepest levels linking prokaryotes eukaryotes tree life actually ring life one fusion partner branches deep within ancient photosynthetic clade related archaeal prokaryotes eubacterial organism either proteobacterium member larger photosynthetic clade includes cyanobacteria proteobacteria
