path beta-carotene carlactone strigolactone-like plant hormone
strigolactones phytohormones diverse signaling activities common structure consisting two lactones connected enol-ether bridge strigolactones derive carotenoids via pathway involving carotenoid cleavage dioxygenases ccd7 ccd8 iron-binding protein d27 show d27 beta-carotene isomerase converts all-trans-beta-carotene cis-beta-carotene cleaved ccd7 cis-configured aldehyde ccd8 incorporates three oxygens cis-beta-apo--carotenal performs molecular rearrangement linking carotenoids strigolactones producing carlactone compound strigolactone-like biological activities knowledge structure carlactone will crucial understanding biology strigolactones may applications combating parasitic weeds
