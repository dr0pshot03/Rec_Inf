disruption multiplanet systems resonance binary orbit 
exoplanetary systems binary stars s-type consist one planets orbiting primary star wide binary stellar companion planetary eccentricities mutual inclinations can large perhaps forced gravitationally binary companion- earlier work single planet systems- appealed kozai-lidov instability wherein sufficiently inclined binary orbit excites large-amplitude oscillations planets eccentricity inclination instability however can quenched many agents induce fast orbital precession including mutual gravitational forces multiplanet system report orbital precession inhibits kozai-lidov cycling multiplanet system can become fast enough resonate orbital motion distant binary companion resonant binary forcing results dramatic outcomes ranging excitation large planetary eccentricities mutual inclinations total disruption processes planetary migration can bring initially non-resonant system resonance require special physical initial conditions binary resonant driving generic may altered architecture many multiplanet systems can also weaken multiplanet occurrence rate wide binaries affect planet formation close binaries
