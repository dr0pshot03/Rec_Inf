elementary response olfactory receptor neurons odorants 
signaling heterotrimeric gtp-binding proteins g proteins drives numerous cellular processes number g protein molecules activated single membrane receptor determinant signal amplification although cases parameter remains unknown retinal rod photoreceptors long-lived photoisomerized rhodopsin molecule activates many g protein molecules transducins yielding substantial amplification large elementary single-photon response rhodopsin activity terminated report elementary response olfactory transduction extremely small ligand-bound odorant receptor low probability activating even one g protein molecule odorant dwell-time brief thus signal amplification olfactory transduction appears fundamentally different phototransduction
