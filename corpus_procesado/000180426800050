endoproteolytic activity proteasome
proteasome plays central role degradation regulatory misfolded proteins current models suggest substrates access internal catalytic sites processively threading termini gated substrate channel found latent closed activated open proteasomes degraded two natively disordered substrates internal peptide bonds even lacked accessible termini suggesting substrates promoted gating proteasome endoproteolysis provides molecular mechanism regulated release transcription factors inactive precursors well means accessing internal folding defects misfolded multidomain proteins
