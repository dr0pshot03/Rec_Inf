phospholipase c gamma controls surface expression trpc3 intermolecular ph domain
many ion channels regulated lipids- prominent motifs lipid binding identified ion channels recently reported phospholipase cgamma1 plc-gamma1 binds regulates trpc3 channels components agonist-induced ca2+ entry cells interaction requires domain plc-gamma1 includes partial pleckstrin homology phdomain consensus lipid-binding protein-binding sequence developed gestalt algorithm detect hitherto invisible ph ph-like domains now report partial ph domain plc-gamma1 interacts complementary partial ph-like domain trpc3 elicit lipid binding cell-surface expression trpc3 findings imply far greater abundance ph domains previously appreciated suggest intermolecular ph-like domains represent widespread signalling mode
