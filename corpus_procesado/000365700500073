particle acceleration solar flare termination shock
solar flares-the powerful explosions solar system-are also efficient particle accelerators capable energizing large number charged particles relativistic speeds termination shock often invoked standard model solar flares possible driver particle acceleration yet existence role remained controversial present observations solar flare termination shock trace morphology dynamics using high-cadence radio imaging spectroscopy show disruption shock coincides abrupt reduction energetic electron population observed properties shock well reproduced simulations results strongly suggest termination shock responsible least part accelerating energetic electrons solar flares
