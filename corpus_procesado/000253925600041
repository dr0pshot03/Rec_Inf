adaptive coding visual information neural populations
perception environment relies capacity neural networks adapt rapidly changes incoming stimuli- increasingly realized neural code adaptive sensory neurons change responses selectivity dynamic manner match changes input stimuli understanding rapid exposure adaptation stimulus fixed structure changes information processing cortical networks essential understanding relationship sensory coding behaviour- physiological investigations adaptation contributed greatly understanding individual sensory neurons change responses influence stimulus coding- yet whether adaptation affects information coding neural populations unknown examine brief adaptation timescale visual fixation influences structure interneuronal correlations accuracy population coding macaque macaca mulatta primary visual cortex v1 find brief adaptation stimulus fixed structure reorganizes distribution correlations across entire network selectively reducing mean variability post adaptation changes neuronal correlations associated specific stimulus dependent changes efficiency population code consistent changes perceptual performance adaptation results implications beyond predictions current theories sensory coding suggesting brief adaptation improves accuracy population coding optimize neuronal performance natural viewing
