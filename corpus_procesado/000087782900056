metalloprotease disintegrin controls cell migration caenorhabditis elegans
caenorhabditis elegans gonad acquires two u-shaped arms directed migration distal tip cells dtcs along body wall basement membranes correct migration dtcs requires mig gene encodes member metalloprotease-disintegrin protein family mig protein secreted muscle cells body wall localizes basement membranes gonad localization dependent disintegrin-like domain mig catalytic activity results suggest mig metalloprotease directs migration dtcs remodeling basement membrane
