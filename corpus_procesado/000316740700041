structural reorganization toll-like receptor dimer induced agonistic ligands
toll-like receptor tlr7 tlr8 recognize single-stranded rna initiate innate immune responses several synthetic agonists tlr7-tlr8 display novel therapeutic potential however molecular basis ligand recognition activation signaling tlr7 tlr8 largely unknown study crystal structures unliganded ligand-induced activated human tlr8 dimers elucidated ligand recognition mediated dimerization interface formed two protomers upon ligand stimulation tlr8 dimer reorganized two c termini brought proximity loop leucine-rich repeat lrr14 lrr15 cleaved however n c-terminal halves remained associated contributed ligand recognition dimerization thus ligand binding induces reorganization tlr8 dimer enables downstream signaling processes
