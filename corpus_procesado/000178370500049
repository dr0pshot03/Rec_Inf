comparative genome proteome analysis anopheles gambiae drosophila melanogaster 
comparison genomes proteomes two diptera anopheles gambiae drosophila melanogaster diverged million years ago reveals considerable similarities however numerous differences also observed; must reflect selection subsequent adaptation associated different ecologies life strategies almost half genes genomes interpreted orthologs show average sequence identity % slightly lower observed orthologs pufferfish human diverged million years ago indicates two insects diverged considerably faster vertebrates aligned sequences reveal orthologous genes retained half intron/exon structure indicating intron gains losses occurred rate one per gene per million years chromosomal arms exhibit significant remnants homology two species although % genes colocalize small "microsyntenic" clusters major interarm transfers well intra-arm shuffling gene order detected
