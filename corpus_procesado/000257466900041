preseismic velocity changes observed active source monitoring parkfield safod drill site
measuring stress changes within seismically active fault zones long sought goal seismology one approach exploit stress dependence seismic wave velocity investigated active source cross well experiment san andreas fault observatory depth safod drill site show stress changes indeed measurable using technique two month period observed excellent anti-correlation changes time required shear wave travel rock along fixed pathway microseconds variations barometric pressure also observed two large excursions travel time data coincident two earthquakes among predicted produce largest coseismic stress changes safod two excursions started approximately hours events respectively suggesting may related pre rupture stress induced changes crack properties observed early laboratory studies
