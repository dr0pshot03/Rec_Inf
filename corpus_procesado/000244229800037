clustering passing messages data points 
clustering data identifying subset representative examples important processing sensory signals detecting patterns data exemplars can found randomly choosing initial subset data points iteratively refining works well initial choice close good solution devised method called affinity propagation takes input measures similarity pairs data points real-valued messages exchanged data points high-quality set exemplars corresponding clusters gradually emerges used affinity propagation cluster images faces detect genes microarray data identify representative sentences manuscript identify cities efficiently accessed airline travel affinity propagation found clusters much lower error methods less one-hundredth amount time
