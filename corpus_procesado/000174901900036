spontaneous breaking time-reversal symmetry pseudogap state high-t-c superconductor 
change symmetry often observed matter undergoes phase transition-the symmetry said spontaneously broken transition made underdoped high-transition-temperature high-t-c superconductors unusual mean-field transition seen superconductors rather region phase diagram superconducting transition temperature t-c phase coherence superconductivity begin characteristic temperature t* pseudogap appears spectrum electronic excitations12 therefore important establish t* just cross-over temperature arising fluctuations order parameter will establish superconductivity t-c refs marks phase transition symmetry spontaneously broken5- report material pseudogap state left-circularly polarized photons give different photocurrent right-circularly polarized photons shows time-reversal symmetry spontaneously broken11 t* therefore corresponds phase transition
