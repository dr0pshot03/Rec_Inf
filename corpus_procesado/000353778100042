mechanical crack propagation drives millisecond daughter cell separation staphylococcus aureus
staphylococcus aureus undergoes cytokinesis builds septum generating two hemispherical daughters whose cell walls connected via narrow peripheral ring found resolution ring occurred within milliseconds popping without detectable changes cell volume likelihood popping depended cell-wall stress separating cells split open asymmetrically leaving daughters connected hinge elastostatic model wall indicated high circumferential stress peripheral ring popping last observed small perforations peripheral ring likely initial points mechanical failure thus ultrafast daughter cell separation s aureus appears driven accumulation stress peripheral ring exhibits hallmarks mechanical crack propagation
