polymorphic butterfly reveals missing link ecological speciation 
ecological speciation occurs ecologically based divergent selection causes evolution reproductive isolation many empirical examples process however exists poorly characterized stage traits distinguish species ecologically reproductively segregate single population using combination genetic mapping mate-choice experiments field observations population genetics studied butterfly population mimetic wing color polymorphism found butterflies exhibited partial color-based assortative mate preference traits represent divergent ecologically based signal preference components sexual isolation usually distinguish incipient sibling species association behavior recognition trait single population may enhance probability speciation provides example missing link interbreeding population isolated species
