microcephalin gene regulating brain size continues evolve adaptively humans
gene microcephalin mcph1 regulates brain size evolved strong positive selection human evolutionary lineage show one genetic variant microcephalin modern humans arose years ago increased frequency rapidly compatible neutral drift indicates spread strong positive selection although exact nature selection unknown finding important brain gene continued evolve adaptively anatomically modern humans suggests ongoing evolutionary plasticity human brain also makes microcephalin attractive candidate locus studying genetics human variation brain-related phenotypes
