nebulin n-wasp cooperate cause igf--induced sarcomeric actin filament formation 
insulin-like growth factor igf- induces skeletal muscle maturation enlargement hypertrophy responses require protein synthesis myofibril formation myofibrillogenesis however signaling mechanisms myofibrillogenesis remain obscure found igf--induced phosphatidylinositol kinase-akt signaling formed complex nebulin n-wasp z bands myofibrils interfering glycogen synthase kinase beta mice although n-wasp known activator arp2/ complex form branched actin filaments nebulin-n-wasp complex caused actin nucleation unbranched actin filament formation z bands without arp2/ complex furthermore n-wasp required igf--induced muscle hypertrophy findings present mechanisms igf--induced actin filament formation myofibrillogenesis required muscle maturation hypertrophy mechanism actin nucleation
