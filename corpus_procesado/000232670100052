calorie restriction promotes mitochondrial biogenesis inducing expression enos 
calorie restriction extends life span organisms ranging yeast mammals report calorie restriction either months induced endothelial nitric oxide synthase enos expression -cyclic guanosine monophosphate formation various tissues male mice accompanied mitochondrial biogenesis increased oxygen consumption adenosine triphosphate production enhanced expression sirtuin effects strongly attenuated enos null-mutant mice thus nitric oxide plays fundamental role processes induced calorie restriction may involved extension life span mammals
