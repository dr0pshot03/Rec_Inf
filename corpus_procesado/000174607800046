spatial scale dictates productivity-biodiversity relationship
diversity life heterogeneously distributed across earth primary cause pattern heterogeneity amount energy primary productivity rate carbon fixed photosynthesis available biota given location- shape relationship productivity species diversity highly variable- many cases relationship hump-shaped diversity peaks intermediate productivity- cases diversity increases linearly productivity-- possible reason discrepancy data often collected different spatial scales mechanisms determine species diversity vary spatial scale shape productivity-diversity relationship present evidence scale-dependent productivity-diversity patterns ponds data viewed local scale among ponds relationship hump-shaped whereas data viewed regional scale among watersheds relationship positively linear dependence scale results dissimilarity local species composition within regions increased productivity
