towards molecular understanding shape selectivity 
shape selectivity simple concept: transformation reactants products depends processed molecules fit active site catalyst nature makes abundant use concept enzymes usually process molecules fit active sites industry also exploited shape selectivity zeolite catalysis almost years yet mechanistic understanding remains rather limited review shape selectivity zeolite catalysis argue simple thermodynamic analysis molecules adsorbed inside zeolite pores can explain products form guide identification zeolite structures particularly suitable desired catalytic applications
