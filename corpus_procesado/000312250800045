rapid folding dna nanoscale shapes constant temperature 
demonstrate constant temperature hundreds dna strands can cooperatively fold long template dna strand within minutes complex nanoscale objects folding occurred equilibrium along nucleation-driven pathways temperatures influenced choice sequences strand lengths chain topology unfolding occurred apparent equilibrium higher temperatures folding folding optimized constant temperatures enabled rapid production three-dimensional dna objects yields approached % results point similarities protein folding spite chemical structural differences possibility rapid high-yield assembly will enable dna nanotechnology practical applications
