dielectric polymer high electric energy density fast discharge speed
dielectric polymers high dipole density potential achieve high energy density required many modern electronics electric systems demonstrate high energy density fast discharge speed low loss can obtained defect-modified polyvinylidene fluoride polymers achieved combining nonpolar polar molecular structural changes polymer proper dielectric constants avoid electric displacement saturation electric fields well breakdown field results indicate high dielectric constant may desirable reach high energy density
