draft map human proteome
availability human genome sequence transformed biomedical research past decade however equivalent map human proteome direct measurements proteins peptides exist yet present draft map human proteome using high-resolution fourier-transform mass spectrometry in-depth proteomic profiling histologically normal human samples including adult tissues fetal tissues purified primary haematopoietic cells resulted identification proteins encoded genes accounting approximately % total annotated protein-coding genes humans unique comprehensive strategy proteogenomic analysis enabled us discover number novel protein-coding regions includes translated pseudogenes non-coding rnas upstream open reading frames large human proteome catalogue available interactive web-based resource http://wwwhumanproteomemaporg will complement available human genome transcriptome data accelerate biomedical research health disease
