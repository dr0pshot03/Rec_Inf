reduced radiative conductivity low-spin mgfeo lower mantle
optical absorption spectra measured pressures gigapascals gpa tower-mantle oxide magnesiowustite mgfeo upon reaching high-spin tow-spin transition fe2+ gpa observed enhanced absorption mid near-infrared spectral range whereas absorption visible-ultraviolet reduced observed changes absorption contrast prediction attributed d-d orbital charge transfer fe2+ ion results indicate low-spin mgfeo will exhibit lower radiative thermal conductivity high-spin mgfeo needs considered future geodynamic models convection plume stabilization lower mantle
