role rnai selective correction dna methylation defects 
dna methylation essential silencing transposable elements genes higher eukaryotes suggests modification must tightly controlled however accidental changes dna methylation can transmitted mitosis cancer meiosis leading epiallelic variation demonstrated existence efficient mechanism protects transgenerational loss dna methylation arabidopsis remethylation specific subset heavily methylated repeats targeted rna interference rnai machinery process spread flanking regions usually progressive several generations faithfully restores wild-type methylation target sequences rnai-dependent manner findings suggest important role rnai protecting genomes long-term epigenetic defects
