malaria estimated cause million deaths per year actual figures substantially higher owing under-reporting difficulties diagnosis new control measures developed malaria death toll projected double next years efforts control disease hampered drug resistance plasmodium parasites insecticide resistance mosquitoes lack effective vaccine mosquitoes obligatory vectors malaria transmission spread malaria curtailed rendering incapable transmitting parasites many tools required genetic manipulation mosquito competence malaria transmission developed foreign genes can now introduced germ line culicine anopheline mosquitoes transgenes can expressed tissue-specific manner report use tools generate transgenic mosquitoes express antiparasitic genes midgut epithelium thus rendering inefficient vectors disease findings significant implications development new strategies malaria control
