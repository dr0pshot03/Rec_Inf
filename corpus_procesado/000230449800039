resonating valence-bond ground state phenalenyl-based neutral radical conductor
organic material composed neutral free radicals based spiro-biphenalenyl system exhibits room temperature conductivity siemens per centimeter high-symmetry crystal structure displays temperature-independent pauli paramagnetism characteristic metal magnetic susceptibility implies density states fermi level states per electron volt per mote extended huckel calculations indicate solid three-dimensional organic metal band width similar electron volts however compound shows activated conductivity activation energy electron volts optical energy gap electron volts argue apparently contradictory properties best resolved terms resonating valence-bond ground state originally suggested pauling modifications introduced anderson
