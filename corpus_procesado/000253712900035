long-term sea-level fluctuations driven ocean basin dynamics
earths long term sea level history characterized widespread continental flooding cretaceous period similar million years ago followed gradual regression inland seas however published estimates late cretaceous sea level high differ half order magnitude similar similar meters present level low estimate based stratigraphy new jersey margin assimilating marine geophysical data reconstructions ancient ocean basins model late cretaceous sea level meters higher today use mantle convection model suggest new jersey subsided meters past million years north americas westward passage subducted farallon plate mechanism reconciles new jersey margin based sea level estimates ocean basin reconstructions
