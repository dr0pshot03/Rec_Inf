single-cell mass cytometry differential immune drug responses across human hematopoietic continuum 
flow cytometry essential tool dissecting functional complexity hematopoiesis used single-cell "mass cytometry" examine healthy human bone marrow measuring parameters simultaneously single cells binding antibodies viability dna content relative cell size signaling behavior cell subsets spanning defined hematopoietic hierarchy monitored simultaneous markers functional signaling states perturbed set ex vivo stimuli inhibitors data set allowed algorithmically driven assembly related cell types defined surface antigen expression providing superimposable map cell signaling responses combination drug inhibition visualized manner analysis revealed previously unappreciated instances precise signaling responses bounded within conventionally defined cell subsets continuous phosphorylation responses crossed cell population boundaries unexpected manners yet tracked closely cellular phenotype collectively single-cell analyses provide system-wide views immune signaling healthy human hematopoiesis drug action disease can compared mechanistic studies pharmacologic intervention
