universal theory nonlinear luttinger liquids
one dimensional quantum fluids conventionally described using effective hydrodynamic approach known luttinger liquid theory principal simplification generic spectrum constituent particles replaced linear one leads linear hydrodynamic theory show describe measurable dynamic response functions one needs take account nonlinearity generic spectrum thus resulting quantum hydrodynamic theory nonlinearity leads example qualitative change behavior spectral function universal theory developed article applicable wide class one-dimensional fermionic bosonic spin systems
