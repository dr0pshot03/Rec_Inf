molecular determinants scouting behavior honey bees 
little known molecular basis differences behavior among individuals report consistent novelty-seeking behavior across different contexts among honey bees tendency scout food sources nest sites reveal molecular underpinnings behavior relative foragers scout food scouts showed extensive differences brain gene expression relative foragers including differences related catecholamine glutamate gamma-aminobutyric acid signaling octopamine glutamate treatments increased likelihood scouting whereas dopamine antagonist treatment decreased findings demonstrate intriguing similarities human insect novelty seeking suggest trait presumably evolved independently two lineages may subserved conserved molecular components
