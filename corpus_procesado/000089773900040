population genetics ecological specialization evolving escherichia coli populations 
organisms adapt genetically one environment may lose fitness environments- two distinct population genetic processes can produce ecological specialization-mutation accumulation antagonistic pleiotropy- mutation accumulation mutations become fixed genetic drift genes maintained selection adaptation one environment loss adaptation another caused different mutations antagonistic pleiotropy arises trade-offs mutations beneficial one environment detrimental another general difficult distinguish processes- analysed decay unused catabolic functions lines escherichia coli propagated glucose generations time several lines evolved high mutation rates mutation accumulation important unused functions decay lines significant difference observed moreover catabolic losses occurred early experiment beneficial mutations rapidly fixed pattern predicted antagonistic pleiotropy thus antagonistic pleiotropy appears important mutation accumulation decay unused catabolic functions populations
