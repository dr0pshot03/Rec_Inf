deterministic preparation tunable few-fermion system 
systems consisting interacting fermions building blocks matter atoms nuclei prominent examples created few-body quantum system complete control quantum state using ultracold fermionic atoms optical dipole trap ground-state systems consisting particles prepared fidelities similar % can tune interparticle interactions arbitrary values using feshbach resonance observed interaction-induced energy shift pair repulsively interacting atoms work expected enable quantum simulation strongly correlated few-body systems
