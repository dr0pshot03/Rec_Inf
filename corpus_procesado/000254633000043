entrainment neuronal oscillations mechanism attentional selection 
whereas gamma band neuronal oscillations clearly appear integral visual attention role lower frequency oscillations still debated mounting evidence indicates key functional property oscillations rhythmic shifting excitability local neuronal ensembles show attended stimuli rhythmic stream delta band oscillations primary visual cortex entrain rhythm stream resulting increased response gain task relevant events decreased reaction times hierarchical cross frequency coupling delta phase also determines momentary power higher frequency activity instrumental functions low frequency oscillations support conceptual framework integrates numerous earlier findings
