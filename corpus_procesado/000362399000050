dilution cell cycle inhibitor whi5 controls budding-yeast cell size 
cell size fundamentally affects biosynthetic processes determining scale organelles influencing surface transport although extensive studies identified many mutations affecting cell size molecular mechanisms underlying size control remained elusive budding yeast saccharomyces cere-visiae size control occurs g1 phase start point irreversible commitment cell division previously thought activity g1 cyclin cln3 increased cell size trigger start initiating inhibition transcriptional inhibitor whi5 refs show although cln3 concentration modulate rate cells pass start synthesis increases proportion cell size total concentration nearly constant pre-start g1 rather increasing cln3 activity identify decreasing whi5 activity-due dilution whi5 cell growth-as molecular mechanism cell size controls proliferation whi5 synthesized s/g2/m phases cell cycle largely size-independent manner results smaller daughter cells born higher whi5 concentrations extend pre-start g1 phase thus fundamental level size control budding yeast results differential scaling cln3 whi5 synthesis rates cell size generally work shows differential size-dependency protein synthesis can provide elegant mechanism coordinate cellular functions growth
