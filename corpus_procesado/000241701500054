two modes fusion pore opening revealed cell-attached recordings synapse 
fusion vesicle cell membrane opens pore releases transmitter extracellular space1- pore can either dilate fully vesicle collapses completely close rapidly generate kiss-and-run fusion124- size pore determines release rate2 synapses size fusion pore unclear kiss-and-run remains controversial8- ability kiss-and-run fusion generate rapid synaptic currents1617 questionable18 recording fusion pore kinetics single vesicle fusion found full collapse kiss-and-run fusion calyx-type synapses full collapse initial fusion pore conductance gp usually > ps increased rapidly > ps ms- kiss-and-run fusion seen brief capacitance flicker < s gp > ps flickers within ps remaining flickers large gp > ps might discharge transmitter rapidly thereby cause rapid synaptic currents whereas small gp might generate slow small synaptic currents results show kiss-and-run fusion occurs synapses can generate rapid postsynaptic currents suggest various fusion pore sizes help control kinetics amplitude synaptic currents
