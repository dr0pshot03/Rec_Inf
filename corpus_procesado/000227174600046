force generation mammalian hair bundles supports role cochlear amplification
generally accepted acute sensitivity frequency discrimination mammalian hearing requires active mechanical amplification sound stimulus within cochlea prevailing hypothesis amplification stems somatic electromotility outer hair cells attributable motor protein prestin thus outer hair cells contract elongate synchrony sound-evoked receptor potential problems arise mechanism high frequencies periodic component receptor potential will attenuated membrane time constant basis work non-mammalian vertebrates force generation hair bundles proposed alternative means boosting mechanical stimulus show hair bundles mammalian outer hair cells can also produce force submillisecond timescale linked adaptation mechano-transducer channels bundle motor may ultimately limited deactivation rate channels theoretically operate high frequencies results show existence another force generator outer hair cells may participate cochlear amplification
