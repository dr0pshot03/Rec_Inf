regulation blood glucose hypothalamic pyruvate metabolism 
brain keenly depends glucose energy mammalians redundant systems control glucose production increase circulating glucose inhibits glucose production liver negative feedback impaired type diabetes report primary increase hypothalamic glucose levels lowers blood glucose inhibition glucose production rats effect glucose requires conversion lactate followed stimulation pyruvate metabolism leads activation adenosine triphosphate atp-sensitive potassium channels thus interventions designed enhance hypothalamic sensing glucose may improve glucose homeostasis diabetes
