analysis evolutionary species-area relationship
large islands typically species comparable smaller islands ecological theories influential equilibrium theory island biogeography explain species-area relationship outcome effect area immigration extinction rates however theories apply taxa land masses including continents large islands generate species situ case species-area relationships driven higher speciation rates larger areas- theory never quantitatively tested show anolis lizards caribbean islands meet several expectations evolutionary theory within-island speciation exceeds immigration source new species islands larger km whereas speciation rare smaller islands threshold island size rate species proliferation increases island area process results principally positive effects area speciation rate also expected slope species-area relationship jumps sharply threshold although anolis lizards present large caribbean islands million years indications current number species still falls speciation-extinction equilibrium
