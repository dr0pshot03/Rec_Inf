efficient bipedal robots based passive-dynamic walkers 
passive-dynamic walkers simple mechanical devices composed solid parts connected joints walk stably slope motors controllers yet can remarkably humanlike motions suggests machines useful models human locomotion; however walk level ground present three robots based passive-dynamics small active power sources substituted gravity can walk level ground robots use less control less energy powered robots yet walk naturally suggesting importance passive-dynamics human locomotion
