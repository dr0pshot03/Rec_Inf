regulated cleavage contact-mediated axon repellent 
contact-mediated axon repulsion ephrins raises unresolved question: cell surface ligands form high-affinity multivalent complex receptors present axons yet rather bound axons can rapidly repelled show ephrin-a2 forms stable complex metalloprotease kuzbanian involving interactions outside cleavage region protease domain eph receptor binding triggered ephrin-a2 cleavage localized reaction specific cognate ligand cleavage-inhibiting mutation ephrin-a2 delayed axon withdrawal studies reveal mechanisms protease recognition control cell surface proteins ephrin-a2 may provide means efficient axon detachment termination signaling
