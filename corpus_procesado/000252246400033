superconducting vortices cecoin5: toward pauli-limiting field
many superconducting materials allow penetration magnetic fields mixed state superfluid threaded regular lattice abrikosov vortices carrying one quantum magnetic flux phenomenological ginzburg landau theory based concept characteristic length scales generally provided good description abrikosov vortex lattice state conducted neutron scattering measurements vortex lattice form factor heavy fermion superconductor cerium cobalt indium cecoin5 found form factor increases increasing field opposite expectations within abrikosov ginzburg landau paradigm propose anomalous field dependence form factor arises pauli paramagnetic effects around vortex cores proximity superconducting state quantum critical point
