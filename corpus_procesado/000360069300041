cytosolic network suppressing mitochondria-mediated proteostatic stress cell death 
mitochondria multifunctional organelles whose dysfunction leads neuromuscular degeneration ageing multifunctionality poses great challenge understanding mechanisms mitochondrial dysfunction causes specific pathologies among leading mitochondrial mediators cell death energy depletion free radical production defects iron-sulfur cluster biosynthesis release pro-apoptotic non-cell-autonomous signalling molecules altered stress signalling- identify new pathway mitochondria-mediated cell death yeast pathway named mitochondrial precursor over-accumulation stress mpos characterized aberrant accumulation mitochondrial precursors cytosol mpos can triggered clinically relevant mitochondrial damage limited core machineries protein import also discover large network genes suppress mpos modulating ribosomal biogenesis messenger rna decapping transcript-specific translation protein chaperoning turnover response mpos several ribosome-associated proteins upregulated including gis2 nog2 promote cap-independent translation inhibit nuclear export 60s ribosomal subunit respectively gis2 nog2 upregulation promotes cell survival may part feedback loop attenuates mpos data indicate mitochondrial dysfunction contributes directly cytosolic proteostatic stress provide explanation association two hallmarks degenerative diseases ageing results relevant understanding diseases example spinocerebellar ataxia amyotrophic lateral sclerosis myotonic dystrophy involve mutations within anti-degenerative network
