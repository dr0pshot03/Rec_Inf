copes rule evolution marine animals
copes rule proposes animal lineages evolve toward larger body size time test hypothesis across marine animals compiled data set body sizes genera marine animals spanning past million years mean biovolume across genera increased factor since cambrian whereas minimum biovolume decreased less factor maximum biovolume increased factor neutral drift small initial value explain pattern instead size increase reflects differential diversification across classes indicating pattern reflect simple scaling-up widespread persistent selection larger size within populations
