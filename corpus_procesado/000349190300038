grid cell symmetry shaped environmental geometry 
grid cells represent animals location firing multiple fields arranged striking hexagonal array impressive constant regularity prompted suggestions grid cells represent universal environmental-invariant metric navigation originally properties grid patterns believed independent shape environment notion dominated almost theoretical grid cell models- however several studies indicate environmental boundaries influence grid firing- though strength nature longevity effect unclear show grid orientation scale symmetry homogeneity strongly permanently affected environmental geometry found grid patterns orient walls polarized enclosures squares circles furthermore hexagonal grid symmetry permanently broken highly polarized environments trapezoids pattern elliptical less homogeneous results provide compelling evidence idea environmental boundaries compete internal organization grid cell system drive grid firing notably grid cell activity local previously thought consequence provide universal spatial metric environments
