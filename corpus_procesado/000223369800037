chemical remodelling cell surfaces living animals
cell surfaces endowed biological functionality designed mediate extracellular communication cell-surface repertoire can expanded include abiotic functionality biosynthetic introduction unnatural sugars cellular glycans process termed metabolic oligosaccharide engineering technique exploited fundamental studies glycan-dependent cell-cell virus-cell interactions- also provides avenue chemical remodelling living cells- unique chemical functional groups can delivered cell-surface glycans metabolism corresponding unnatural precursor sugars functional groups can undergo covalent reaction exogenous agents bearing complementary functionality exquisite chemical selectivity required process supplied staudinger ligation azides phosphines reaction performed cultured cells without detriment physiology demonstrate staudinger ligation can executed living animals enabling chemical modification cells within native environment ability tag cell-surface glycans vivo may enable therapeutic targeting noninvasive imaging changes glycosylation disease progression
