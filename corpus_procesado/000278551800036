measurement single-cell dynamics
populations cells almost always heterogeneous function fate understand plasticity cells vital measure quantitatively dynamically molecular processes underlie cell-fate decisions single cells early events cell signalling often occur within seconds stimulus whereas intracellular signalling processes transcriptional changes can take minutes hours contrast cell-fate decisions whether cell divides differentiates dies can take many hours days multiparameter experimental computational methods integrate quantitative measurement mathematical simulation noisy complex processes required understand highly dynamic mechanisms control cell plasticity fate
