leading-edge vortex improves lift slow-flying bats
staying aloft hovering flying slowly demanding according quasi steady state aerodynamic theory slow flying vertebrates able generate enough lift remain aloft therefore unsteady aerodynamic mechanisms enhance lift production proposed using digital particle image velocimetry showed small nectar feeding bat able increase lift much % using attached leading edge vortices levs slow forward flight resulting maximum lift coefficient airflow passing lev reattaches behind lev smoothly wing despite exceptionally large local angles attack wing camber results show use unsteady aerodynamic mechanisms flapping flight limited insects also used larger heavier animals
