process tholin formation titans upper atmosphere
titans lower atmosphere long known harbor organic aerosols tholins presumed formed simple molecules methane nitrogen ch4 n- now assumed tholins formed altitudes several hundred kilometers processes yet unobserved using measurements combination mass/charge energy/ charge spectrometers cassini spacecraft obtained evidence tholin formation high altitudes similar kilometers titans atmosphere observed chemical mix strongly implies series chemical reactions physical processes lead simple molecules ch4 n- larger complex molecules daltons negatively charged massive molecules similar daltons identify tholins process involves massive negatively charged molecules aerosols completely unexpected
