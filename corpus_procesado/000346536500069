promoter architecture dictates cell-to-cell variability gene expression 
variability gene expression among genetically identical cells emerged central preoccupation study gene regulation; however divide exists predictions molecular models prokaryotic transcriptional regulation genome-wide experimental studies suggesting variability indifferent underlying regulatory architecture constructed set promoters escherichia coli promoter strength transcription factor binding strength transcription factor copy numbers systematically varied used messenger rna mrna fluorescence situ hybridization observe changes affected variability gene expression parameter-free models predicted observed variability; hence molecular details transcription dictate variability mrna expression transcriptional noise specifically tunable thus represents evolutionarily accessible phenotypic parameter
