corepressor-dependent silencing chromosomal regions encoding neuronal genes 
molecular mechanisms central nervous system-specific genes expressed nervous system repressed tissues remain central issue developmental regulatory biology report zinc-finger gene-specific repressor element re- silencing transcription factor/neuronal restricted silencing factor rest/nrsf can mediate extra-neuronal restriction imposing either active repression via histone deacetylase recruitment long-term gene silencing using distinct functional complex silencing neuronal-specific genes requires recruitment associated corepressor corest serves functional molecular beacon recruitment molecular machinery imposes silencing across chromosomal interval including transcriptional units contain rest/nrsf response elements
