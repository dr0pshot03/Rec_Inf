cell transplantation potential strategy treating blindness caused loss photoreceptors although transplanted rod-precursor cells able migrate adult retina differentiate acquire specialized morphological features mature photoreceptor cells1 fundamental question remains whether transplantation photoreceptor cells can actually improve vision provide evidence functional rod-mediated vision photoreceptor transplantation adult gnat1-/- mice lack rod function model congenital stationary night blindness2 show transplanted rod precursors form classic triad synaptic connections second-order bipolar horizontal cells recipient retina newly integrated photoreceptor cells light-responsive dim-flash kinetics similar adult wild-type photoreceptors using intrinsic imaging scotopic conditions demonstrate visual signals generated transplanted rods projected higher visual areas including v1 moreover cells capable driving optokinetic head tracking visually guided behaviour gnat1-/- mouse scotopic conditions together results demonstrate feasibility photoreceptor transplantation therapeutic strategy restoring vision retinal degeneration
