somatic mutation single human neurons tracks developmental transcriptional history
neurons live decades postmitotic state genomes susceptible dna damage survey landscape somatic single-nucleotide variants snvs human brain identified thousands somatic snvs single-cell sequencing neurons cerebral cortex three normal individuals unlike germline cancer snvs often caused errors dna replication neuronal mutations appear reflect damage active transcription somatic mutations create nested lineage trees allowing dated relative developmental landmarks revealing polyclonal architecture human cerebral cortex thus somatic mutations brain represent durable ongoing record neuronal life history development postmitotic function
