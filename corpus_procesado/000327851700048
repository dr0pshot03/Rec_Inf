oncogenic nras bimodal effects stem cells sustainably increase competitiveness
pre-leukaemic mutations thought promote clonal expansion haematopoietic stem cells hscs increasing self-renewal competitiveness however mutations increase hsc proliferation tend reduce competitiveness self-renewal potential raising question mutant hsc can sustainably outcompete wild-type hscs activating mutations nras prevalent human myeloproliferative neoplasms leukaemia show single allele oncogenic nrasg12d increases hsc proliferation also increases reconstituting self-renewal potential upon serial transplantation irradiated mice prior leukaemia initiation nrasg12d also confers long-term self-renewal potential multipotent progenitors explore mechanism nrasg12d promotes hsc proliferation self-renewal assessed cell-cycle kinetics using h2b-gfp label retention bromodeoxyuridine brdu incorporation nrasg12d bimodal effect hscs increasing frequency hscs divide reducing frequency others divide mirrored bimodal effects reconstituting potential rarely dividing nrasg12d hscs outcompeted wild-type hscs whereas frequently dividing nrasg12d hscs nrasg12d caused effects promoting stat5 signalling inducing different transcriptional responses different subsets hscs one signal can therefore increase hsc proliferation competitiveness self-renewal bimodal effects hsc gene expression cycling reconstituting potential
