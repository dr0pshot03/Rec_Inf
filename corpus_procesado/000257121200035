phylogenomic study birds reveals evolutionary history 
deep avian evolutionary relationships difficult resolve result putative explosive radiation study examined similar kilobases aligned nuclear dna sequences independent loci species representing major extant groups recovered robust phylogeny genome wide signal supported multiple analytical methods documented well supported previously unrecognized interordinal relationships sister relationship passerines parrots corroborated previously contentious groupings flamingos grebes conclusions challenge current classifications alter understanding trait evolution; example diurnal birds evolved nocturnal ancestors results provide valuable resource phylogenetic comparative studies birds
