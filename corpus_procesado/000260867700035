slide action: dynamic shuttling hiv reverse transcriptase nucleic acid substrates
reverse transcriptase rt human immunodeficiency virus hiv catalyzes series reactions convert single stranded viral rna double stranded dna host cell integration process requires variety enzymatic activities including dna polymerization rna cleavage strand transfer strand displacement synthesis used single molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer probe interactions rt nucleic acid substrates real time rt observed slide nucleic acid duplexes rapidly shuttling opposite termini duplex upon reaching dna terminus rt can spontaneously flip polymerization orientation sliding kinetics regulated cognate nucleotides anti hiv drugs stabilized destabilized polymerization mode respectively long range translocation activities facilitate multiple stages reverse transcription pathway including normal dna polymerization strand displacement synthesis
