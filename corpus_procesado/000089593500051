resetting circadian time peripheral tissues glucocorticoid signaling
mammals circadian oscillators reside suprachiasmatic nucleus brain harbors central pacemaker also peripheral tissues show glucocorticoid hormone analog dexamethasone induces circadian gene expression cultured rat fibroblasts transiently changes phase circadian gene expression liver kidney heart however dexamethasone affect cyclic gene expression neurons suprachiasmatic nucleus enabled us establish apparent phase-shift response curve specifically peripheral clocks intact animals contrast central clock circadian oscillators peripheral tissues appear remain responsive phase resetting throughout day
