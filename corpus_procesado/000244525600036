structure suspended graphene sheets 
recent discovery graphene sparked much interest thus far focused peculiar electronic structure material charge carriers mimic massless relativistic particles- however physical structure graphene single layer carbon atoms densely packed honeycomb crystal lattice also puzzling one hand graphene appears strictly two-dimensional material exhibiting high crystal quality electrons can travel submicrometre distances without scattering hand perfect two-dimensional crystals exist free state according theory experiment- incompatibility can avoided arguing graphene structures studied far integral part larger three-dimensional structures either supported bulk substrate embedded three-dimensional matrix-- report individual graphene sheets freely suspended microfabricated scaffold vacuum air membranes one atom thick yet still display long-range crystalline order however studies transmission electron microscopy also reveal suspended graphene sheets perfectly flat: exhibit intrinsic microscopic roughening surface normal varies several degrees out-of-plane deformations reach nm atomically thin single-crystal membranes offer ample scope fundamental research new technologies whereas observed corrugations third dimension may provide subtle reasons stability two-dimensional crystals-
