mono-versus polyubiquitination: differential control p53 fate mdm2
although mdm2-mediated ubiquitination essential degradation nuclear export p53 molecular basis differential effects mdm2 remains unknown show low levels mdm2 activity induce monoubiquitination nuclear export p53 whereas high levels promote p53s polyubiquitination nuclear degradation p53-ubiquitin fusion protein mimics monoubiquitinated p53 found accumulate cytoplasm mdm2-independent manner indicating monoubiquitination critical p53 trafficking results clarify nature ubiquitination-mediated p53 regulation suggest distinct mechanisms regulate p53 function accordance levels mdm2 activity
