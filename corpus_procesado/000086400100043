semaphorin 3a chemoattractant cortical apical dendrites 
apical dendrites pyramidal neurons integrate inputs various cortical layers central information processing show growth apical dendrites towards pial surface regulated diffusible chemoattractant present high levels near marginal zone major component signal semaphorin 3a sema3a previously characterized chemorepellant cortical axons soluble guanylate cyclase asymmetrically localized developing apical dendrite required chemoattractive effect sema3a thus asymmetric localization soluble guanylate cyclase confers distinct sema3a responses axons dendrites observations reveal mechanism single chemotropic signal can pattern axons dendrites development
