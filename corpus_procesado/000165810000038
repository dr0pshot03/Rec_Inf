planar hexacoordinate carbon: viable possibility 
viability molecules planar hexacoordinate carbon atoms demonstrated density-functional theory dft calculations cb62- cb6h2 isomer three c3b4 minima species six pi electrons aromatic although c3b4 isomers lower energy activation barriers rearrangements three planar carbon c3b4 minima stable isomers appreciable experimental observation possible high-level ab initio calculations confirm dft results planar hexacoordination species violate octet rule six partial bonds central carbons involved
