cooperation conflict quorum-sensing bacterial populations 
suggested bacterial cells communicate releasing sensing small diffusible signal molecules process commonly known quorum sensing qs1- generally assumed qs used coordinate cooperative behaviours population level35 however evolutionary theory predicts individuals communicate cooperate can exploited6- examine social evolution qs experimentally opportunistic pathogen pseudomonas aeruginosa show although qs can provide benefit group level exploitative individuals can avoid cost producing qs signal performing cooperative behaviour coordinated qs can therefore spread also show solution problem exploitation kin selection interacting bacterial cells tend close relatives results show problem exploitation focus considerable attention animal communication also arises bacteria
