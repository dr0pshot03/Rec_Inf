rna-mediated metal-metal bond formation synthesis hexagonal palladium nanoparticles 
rna sequences discovered mediate growth hexagonal palladium nanoparticles vitro selection techniques used evolve initial library similar to10 unique rna sequences eight cycles selection yield several active sequence families five families representative members form crystalline hexagonal palladium platelets palladium particle growth occurred aqueous solution ambient temperature without endogenous reducing agent low concentrations metal precursor micromolar relative metal precursor rna concentration significantly lower micromolar yet micrometer-size crystalline hexagonal palladium particles formed rapidly minutes
