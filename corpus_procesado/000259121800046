conformational switch syntaxin- controls synaptic vesicle fusion 
synaptic vesicle fusion soluble n ethylmaleimide sensitive factor attachment protein receptor snare protein syntaxin exhibits two conformations bind munc18 : "closed" conformation outside snare complex "open" conformation snare complex although snare complexes containing open syntaxin munc18 essential exocytosis function closed syntaxin unknown generated knockin/knockout mice expressed open syntaxin 1b syntaxin 1bopen mice viable succumbed generalized seizures months age binding munc18 syntaxin impaired syntaxin 1bopen synapses size readily releasable vesicle pool decreased; however rate synaptic vesicle fusion dramatically enhanced thus closed conformation syntaxin gates initiation synaptic vesicle fusion reaction mediated snare complex/ munc18 assemblies
