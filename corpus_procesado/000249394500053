structural basis yeast prion strain variants 
among many surprises arise studies prion biology perhaps unexpected strain phenomenon whereby single protein can misfold structurally distinct infectious states cause distinguishable phenotypes1- similarly proteins can adopt spectrum conformations non-infectious diseases protein folding; toxic others well tolerated4 however understanding structural differences underlying prion strains differences alter physiological impact remains limited use combination solution nmr amide hydrogen/deuterium h/d exchange mutagenesis study structural differences two strain conformations termed sc4 sc37 ref yeast sup35 prion find two strains overlapping amyloid core spanning gln/asn-rich first amino acids highly protected h/d exchange sensitive mutation features indicate cores composed tightly packed beta-sheets possibly resembling steric zipper structures revealed x-ray crystallography sup35-derived peptides67 stable structure greatly expanded sc37 conformation encompass first amino acids revealing strain shows increased fibre stability decreased ability undergo chaperone-mediated replication8 findings establish prion strains involve large-scale conformational differences provide structural basis understanding broad range functional studies including conformational changes alter physiological impact prion strains
