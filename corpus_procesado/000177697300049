syncam synaptic adhesion molecule drives synapse assembly 
synapses junctions nerve cells communicate formed coordinated assembly tight attachment pre postsynaptic specializations now show syncam brain-specific immunoglobulin domain containing protein binds intracellular pdz-domain proteins functions homophilic cell adhesion molecule synapse expression isolated cytoplasmic tail syncam neurons inhibited synapse assembly conversely expression full-length syncam nonneuronal cells induced synapse formation cocultured hippocampal neurons normal release properties glutamatergic synaptic transmission reconstituted nonneuronal cells coexpressing glutamate receptors syncam suggests single type adhesion molecule glutamate receptor sufficient functional postsynaptic response
