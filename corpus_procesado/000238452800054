nanoassembly fractal polymer: molecular "sierpinski hexagonal gasket" 
mathematics art converge fractal forms also abound nature used molecular self-assembly create synthetic nanometer-scale sierpinski hexagonal gasket non-dendritic perfectly self-similar fractal macromolecule composed bis-terpyridine building blocks bound together coordination ru fe ions form nearly planar array increasingly larger hexagons around hollow center
