membrane-based processes sustainable power generation using water
water always crucial combustion hydroelectric processes become source power membrane-based systems capture energy natural waste waters two processes emerging sustainable methods capturing energy sea water: pressure-retarded osmosis reverse electrodialysis processes can also capture energy waste heat generating artificial salinity gradients using synthetic solutions thermolytic salts source energy comes organic matter waste waters can harnessed using microbial fuel-cell technology allowing wastewater treatment power production
