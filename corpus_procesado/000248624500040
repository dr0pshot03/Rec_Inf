augmented wnt signaling mammalian model accelerated aging 
contribution stem progenitor cell dysfunction depletion normal aging remains incompletely understood explored concept klotho mouse model accelerated aging analysis various tissues organs young klotho mice revealed decrease stem cell number increase progenitor cell senescence klotho secreted protein postulated klotho might interact soluble mediators stem cells found klotho bound various wnt family members cell culture model wnt-klotho interaction resulted suppression wnt biological activity tissues organs klotho-deficient animals showed evidence increased wnt signaling ectopic expression klotho antagonized activity endogenous exogenous wnt vitro vivo continuous wnt exposure triggered accelerated cellular senescence thus klotho appears secreted wnt antagonist wnt proteins unexpected role mammalian aging
