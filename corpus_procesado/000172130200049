reconstitution physiological microtubule dynamics using purified components 
microtubules dynamically unstable polymers interconvert stochastically polymerization depolymerization compared microtubules assembled purified tubulin microtubules physiological environment polymerize faster transit frequently polymerization depolymerization dynamic properties essential functions microtubule cytoskeleton diverse cellular processes reconstituted essential features physiological microtubule dynamics mixing three purified components: tubulin; microtubule-stabilizing protein xmap215; microtubule-destabitizing kinesin xkcm1 represents essential first step reconstitution complex microtubule dynamics-dependent processes chromosome segregation purified components
