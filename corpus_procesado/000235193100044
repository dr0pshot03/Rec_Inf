studying genomes extinct species two principal limitations typically small quantities endogenous ancient dna degraded condition even though products base pairs bp amplified rare cases using small overlapping polymerase chain reaction products longer stretches sequences even whole mitochondrial genomes can reconstructed approach limited number amplifications can performed rare samples thus even well-studied pleistocene species mammoths ground sloths cave bears dna sequences bp reconstructed- report complete mitochondrial genome sequence pleistocene woolly mammoth mammuthus primigenius used mg bone new approach allows simultaneous retrieval multiple sequences small amounts degraded dna phylogenetic analyses show mammoth closely related asian african elephant however divergence mammoth african asian elephants occurred short time corresponding % total length phylogenetic tree three evolutionary lineages
