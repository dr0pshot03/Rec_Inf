fact facilitates transcription-dependent nucleosome alteration 
fact facilitates chromatin transcription complex required transcript elongation nucleosomes rna polymerase ii pol ii vitro show fact facilitates pol ii-driven transcription destabilizing nucleosomal structure one histone h2a-h2b dimer removed enzyme passage also demonstrate fact possesses intrinsic histone chaperone activity can deposit core histones onto dna importantly fact activity requires constituent subunits dependent highly acidic c terminus larger subunit spt16 findings define mechanism pol ii can transcribe chromatin without disrupting epigenetic status
