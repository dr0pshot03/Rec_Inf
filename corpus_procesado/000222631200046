chromatin regulates origin activity drosophila follicle cells 
widely believed dna replication multicellular animals metazoa begins specific origins prereplicative complex pre-rc binds nevertheless consensus sequence origins yet identified metazoa origin identity can change development suggesting epigenetic influences notable example developmental specificity occurs drosophila somatic follicle cells ovary transition genomic replication exclusive rereplication origins control amplification eggshell chorion protein genes show chromatin acetylation critical developmental transition origin specificity find histones active origins hyper-acetylated coincident binding origin recognition complex orc mutation histone deacetylase hdac rpd3 induced genome-wide hyperacetylation genomic replication redistribution origin-binding protein orc2 amplification-stage cells independent effects transcription tethering rpd3 polycomb proteins origin decreased activity whereas tethering chameau acetyltransferase increased origin activity results suggest nucleosome acetylation epigenetic changes important modulators origin activity metazoa
