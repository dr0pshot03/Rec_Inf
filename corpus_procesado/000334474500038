structural basis pathogenic subgenomic flavivirus rna sfrna production 
flaviviruses emerging human pathogens worldwide health threats infection pathogenic subgenomic flaviviral rnas sfrnas produced resisting degradation -> host cell exonuclease xrn1 unknown rna structure-based mechanism present crystal structure complete xrn1-resistant flaviviral rna contains interwoven pseudoknots within compact structure depends highly conserved nucleotides rnas three-dimensional topology creates ringlike conformation end resistant structure passing ring one side fold disruption structure prevents formation sfrna flaviviral infection thus sfrna formation results rna fold interacts directly xrn1 presenting enzyme structure confounds helicase activity
