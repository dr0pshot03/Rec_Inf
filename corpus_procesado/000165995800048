cholinergic enhancement increased selectivity perceptual processing working memory 
using functional magnetic resonance imaging investigated mechanism cholinergic enhancement improves working memory studied effect cholinesterase inhibitor physostigmine subcomponents complex function cholinergic enhancement increased selectivity neural responses extrastriate cortices visual working memory particularly encoding also increased participation ventral extrastriate cortex memory maintenance decreased participation anterior prefrontal cortex results indicate cholinergic enhancement improves memory performance augmenting selectivity perceptual processing encoding thereby simplifying processing demands memory maintenance reducing need prefrontal participation
