origin species natural sexual selection 
ecological speciation considered adaptive response selection local adaptation however besides suitable ecological conditions process requires assortative mating protect nascent species homogenization gene flow means simple model demonstrate disruptive ecological selection favors evolution sexual preferences ornaments signal local adaptation preferences induce assortative mating respect ecological characters enhance strength disruptive selection natural sexual selection thus work concert achieve local adaptation reproductive isolation even presence substantial gene flow resulting speciation process ensues without divergence mating preferences avoiding problems plagued previous models speciation sexual selection
