structure amantadine binding site influenza m2 proton channels lipid bilayers
m2 protein influenza virus membrane-spanning tetrameric proton channel targeted antiviral drugs amantadine rimantadine resistance drugs compromised effectiveness many influenza strains including pandemic h1n1 recent crystal structure m2- showed electron densities attributed single amantadine amino-terminal half pore indicating physical occlusion mechanism inhibition however solution nmr structure m2- showed four rimantadines bound carboxy-terminal lipid-facing surface helices suggesting allosteric mechanism show solid-state nmr spectroscopy two amantadine-binding sites exist m2 phospholipid bilayers high-affinity site occupied single amantadine located n-terminal channel lumen surrounded residues mutated amantadine-resistant viruses quantification protein-amantadine distances resulted angstrom-resolution structure high-affinity binding site second low-affinity site observed c-terminal protein surface drug reaches high concentrations bilayer orientation dynamics drug distinct two sites shown h nmr results indicate amantadine physically occludes m2 channel thus paving way developing new antiviral drugs influenza viruses study demonstrates ability solid-state nmr elucidate small-molecule interactions membrane proteins determine high-resolution structures complexes
