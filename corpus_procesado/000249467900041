common fold mediates vertebrate defense bacterial attack 
proteins containing membrane attack complex/perforin macpf domains play important roles vertebrate immunity embryonic development neural-cell migration vertebrates ninth component complement perforin form oligomeric pores lyse bacteria kill virus-infected cells respectively however mechanism macpf function unknown determined crystal structure bacterial macpf protein plu-macpf photorhabdus luminescens angstrom resolution macpf domain reveals structural similarity pore-forming cholesterol-dependent cytolysins cdcs gram-positive bacteria suggests lytic macpf proteins may use cdc-like mechanism form pores disrupt cell membranes sequence similarity bacterial vertebrate macpf domains suggests fold cdcs family proteins important bacterial pathogenesis probably used vertebrates defense infection
