structural basis inhibition bacterial multidrug exporters 
multidrug efflux transporter acrb homologues important multidrug resistance gram-negative pathogens however despite efforts develop efflux inhibitors clinically useful inhibitors available present pyridopyrimidine derivatives acrb mexb-specific inhibitors inhibit mexy mexb mexy principal multidrug exporters pseudomonas aeruginosa- previously determined crystal structure acrb absence presence antibiotics- drugs shown exported functionally rotating mechanism tandem proximal distal multisite drug-binding pockets describe first inhibitor-bound structures acrb mexb proteins bound pyridopyrimidine derivative pyridopyrimidine derivative binds tightly narrow pit composed phenylalanine cluster located distal pocket sterically hinders functional rotation pit hydrophobic trap branches substrate-translocation channel phe located edge trap acrb mexb contributes tight binding inhibitor molecule pi-pi interaction pyridopyrimidine ring voluminous side chain trp located corresponding position mexy prevents inhibitor binding structure hydrophobic trap described study will contribute development universal inhibitors mexb mexy p aeruginosa
