germ cell specification mice 
specification germ cells mice occurs relatively late embryonic development initiated signals induce expression blimp1 key regulator germ cell epiblast cells early postimplantation embryos blimp1 represses incipient somatic program cells promotes progression toward germ cell fate blimp1 may also role maintenance early germ cell characteristics ensuring escape somatic fate well possible reversion pluripotent stem cells
