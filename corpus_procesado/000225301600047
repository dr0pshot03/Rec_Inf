multifunctional carbon nanotube yarns downsizing ancient technology 
introducing twist spinning multiwalled carbon nanotubes nanotube forests make multi-ply torque-stabilized yarns achieve yarn strengths greater megapascals yarns deform hysteretically large strain ranges reversibly providing % energy damping nearly tough fibers used bulletproof vests unlike ordinary fibers yarns nanotube yarns degraded strength overhand knotting also retain strength flexibility heating air 450degreesc hour immersed liquid nitrogen high creep resistance high electrical conductivity observed retained polymer infiltration substantially increases yarn strength
