biodiversity ecosystem stability decade-long grassland experiment
human-driven ecosystem simplification highlighted questions number species ecosystem influences functioning although biodiversity now known affect ecosystem productivity- effects stability debated- present long-term experimental field test diversity stability hypothesis decade data collection experiment directly controlled number perennial prairie species growing-season climate varied considerably causing year-to-year variation abundances plant species ecosystem productivity found greater numbers plant species led greater temporal stability ecosystem annual aboveground plant production particular decadal temporal stability ecosystem whether measured intervals two five ten years significantly greater higher plant diversity tended increase plots matured ecosystem stability also positively dependent root mass measure perenniating biomass temporal stability ecosystem increased diversity despite lower temporal stability individual species portfolio statistical averaging overyielding effects however found evidence covariance effect results indicate reliable efficient sustainable supply foods example livestock fodder biofuels ecosystem services can enhanced use biodiversity
