hierarchical group dynamics pigeon flocks 
animals travel together groups display variety fascinating motion patterns thought result delicate local interactions among group members- although informative way investigating interpreting collective movement phenomena afforded collection high-resolution spatio-temporal data moving individuals data scarce- virtually non-existent long-distance group motion within natural setting associated technological difficulties present results experiments track logs homing pigeons flying flocks individuals obtained high-resolution lightweight gps devices analysed using variety correlation functions inspired approaches common statistical physics find well-defined hierarchy among flock members data concerning leading roles pairwise interactions defined basis characteristic delay times birds directional choices average spatial position pigeon within flock strongly correlates place hierarchy birds respond quickly conspecifics perceived primarily left eye-both results revealing differential roles birds assume different positions respect flock-mates evolutionary perspective results suggest hierarchical organization group flight may efficient egalitarian one least flock sizes permit regular pairwise interactions among group members leader-follower relationships consistently manifested
