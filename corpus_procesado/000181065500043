comt val158met genotype affects mu-opioid neurotransmitter responses pain stressor 
responses pain stressors regulated interactions multiple brain areas neurochemical systems examined influence common functional genetic polymorphism affecting metabolism catecholamines modulation responses sustained pain humans individuals homozygous met158 allele catechol-o-methyttransferase comt polymorphism val158met showed diminished regional mu-opioid system responses pain compared heterozygotes effects accompanied higher sensory affective ratings pain negative internal affective state opposite effects observed val158 homozygotes comt val158met polymorphism thus influences human experience pain may underlie interindividual differences adaptation responses pain stressful stimuli
