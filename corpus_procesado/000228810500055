postsecretory hydrolysis nectar sucrose specialization ant/plant mutualism 
obligate acacia ant plants house mutualistic ants defense mechanism provide extrafloral nectar efn ant/plant mutualisms widespread little known biochemical basis species specificity despite importance plant/animal interactions little attention paid control chemical composition nectar found high invertase sucrose-cleaving activity acacia efn thus contained sucrose sucrose disaccharide common efns usually attracts nonsymbiotic ants efn ant acacias therefore unattractive ants pseudomyrmex ants specialized live acacia almost invertase activity digestive tracts preferred sucrose-free efn results demonstrate postsecretory regulation carbohydrate composition nectar
