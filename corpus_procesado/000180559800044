nebular origin chondritic fine-grained phyllosilicates 
hydrated minerals occur accretionary rims around chondrules cm chondrites previous models suggested phyllosilicates form gas-solid reactions canonical solar nebula propose chondrule-forming shock waves icy regions nebula produced conditions allowed rapid mineral hydration time scales phyllosilicate formation similar time takes shocked system cool temperature phyllosilicate stability water ice condensation scenario allows simultaneous formation chondrules fine-grained accretionary rims
