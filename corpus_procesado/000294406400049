femtoscale magnetically induced lattice distortions multiferroic tbmno3
magneto-electric multiferroics exemplified tbmno3 possess magnetic ferroelectric long-range order magnetic order mostly understood whereas nature ferroelectricity remained elusive competing models proposed explain ferroelectricity associated respectively charge transfer ionic displacements exploiting magneto-electric coupling used electric field produce single magnetic domain state magnetic field induce ionic displacements conditions interference charge magnetic x-ray scattering arose encoding amplitude phase displacements combined theoretical analysis data allow us resolve ionic displacements femtoscale show displacements make substantial contribution zero-field ferroelectric moment
