direct integration hox segmentation gene inputs drosophila development 
drosophila embryogenesis segments anterior posterior compartment generated segmentation genes hox genes provide segment unique identity two processes thought occur independently show abdominal hox proteins work directly two different segmentation proteins sloppy paired engrailed repress hox target gene distalless anterior posterior compartments respectively results suggest segmentation proteins can function hox cofactors reveal previously unanticipated use compartments gene regulation hox proteins results suggest two classes proteins may collaborate directly control gene expression many downstream target genes
