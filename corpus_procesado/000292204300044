single-molecule fluorescence reveals sequence-specific misfolding multidomain proteins
large range debilitating medical conditions linked protein misfolding may compete productive folding particularly proteins containing multiple domains seventy-five per cent eukaryotic proteome consists multidomain proteins yet understood interdomain misfolding avoided proposed maintaining low sequence identity covalently linked domains mechanism avoid misfolding use single-molecule forster resonance energy transfer detect quantify rare misfolding events tandem immunoglobulin domains band titin native conditions per cent molecules identical domains misfold refolding vitro form unexpectedly stable state unfolding half-time several days tandem arrays immunoglobulin-like domains humans show significantly lower sequence identity neighbouring domains non-adjacent domains particular sequence identity neighbouring domains found preferentially per cent observe misfolding tandem naturally neighbouring domains low sequence identity per cent whereas misfolding occurs domains per cent identical coarse-grained molecular simulations predict formation domain-swapped structures excellent agreement observed transfer efficiency misfolded species infer interactions underlying misfolding specific result sequence-specific domain-swapping mechanism diversifying sequence neighbouring domains seems successful evolutionary strategy avoid misfolding multidomain proteins
