coherent optical spectroscopy strongly driven quantum dot 
quantum dots typically formed large groupings atoms thus may expected appreciable many-body behavior intense optical excitation nonetheless known exhibit discrete energy levels due quantum confinement effects show like single-atom single-molecule two three-level quantum systems single semiconductor quantum dots can also exhibit interference phenomena driven simultaneously two optical fields probe absorption spectra obtained exhibit autler-townes splitting optical fields drive coupled transitions complex mollow-related structure including gain without population inversion drive transition results open way demonstration numerous quantum level-based applications quantum dot lasers optical modulators quantum logic devices
