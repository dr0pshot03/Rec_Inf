universal allosteric mechanism g alpha activation gpcrs
g protein-coupled receptors gpcrs allosterically activate heterotrimeric g proteins trigger gdp release given similar human gpcrs different g alpha genes raises question whether universal allosteric mechanism governs g alpha activation show different gpcrs interact activate g alpha proteins highly conserved mechanism comparison g alpha small g protein ras reveals evolution short segments undergo disorder-to-order transitions can decouple regions important allosteric activation receptor binding specificity might explain gpcr-g alpha system diversified rapidly conserving allosteric activation mechanism
