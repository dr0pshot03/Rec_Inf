conformational switches modulate protein interactions peptide antibiotic synthetases
protein dynamics plays important role protein function many functionally important motions occur microsecond low millisecond time scale can characterized nuclear magnetic resonance relaxation experiments describe different states peptidyl carrier protein pcp play crucial role function peptide shuttle nonribosomal peptide synthetases tyrocidine system apo-pcp without bound -phosphopantetheine cofactor holo-pcp exist two different stable conformations show one apo conformations one holo conformations identical whereas two remaining conformations detectable nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy either apo holo form demonstrate conformational diversity essential prerequisite directed movement -pp cofactor interaction externally acting proteins thioesterases -pp transferase
