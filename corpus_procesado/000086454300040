regulation area identity mammalian neocortex emx2 pax6
contribution extrinsic genetic mechanisms determining areas mammalian neocortex contested issue study analyzes roles regulatory genes emx2 pax6 expressed opposing gradients neocortical ventricular zone specifying areas changes patterning molecular markers area-specific connections colter thalamus suggest arealization neocortex disproportionately altered emx2 pax6 mutant mice opposing manners predicted countergradients expression: rostral areas expand caudal areas contract emx2 mutants whereas opposite effect seen pax6 mutants findings suggest emx2 pax6 cooperate regulate arealization neocortex confer area identity cortical cells
