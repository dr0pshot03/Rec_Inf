rapid adaptation climate facilitates range expansion invasive plant
adaptation climate evolving contemporary time scales facilitate rapid range expansion across environmental gradients examine local adaptation along climatic gradient north american invasive plant lythrum salicaria show evolution earlier flowering adaptive northern invasion front increases fitness much effects enemy release evolution increased competitive ability however early flowering decreases investment vegetative growth reduces fitness factor southern environments north american invasion commenced results demonstrate local adaptation can evolve quickly range expansion overcoming environmental constraints propagule production
