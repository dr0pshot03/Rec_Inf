small modulation ongoing cortical dynamics sensory input natural vision 
vision believed neural activity primary visual cortex predominantly driven sensory input environment however visual cortical neurons respond repeated presentations stimulus high degree variability1- although variability considered noise owing random spontaneous activity within cortex5- recent studies show spontaneous activity highly coherent spatio-temporal structure8- raises possibility pattern spontaneous activity may shape neural responses natural viewing conditions larger extent previously thought examine relationship spontaneous activity response primary visual cortical neurons dynamic natural-scene random-noise film images awake freely viewing ferrets time eye opening maturity correspondence evoked neural activity structure input signal weak young animals systematically improved age improvement linked shift dynamics spontaneous activity ages including mature animal correlations spontaneous neural firing slightly modified visual stimulation irrespective sensory input results suggest developing mature visual cortex sensory evoked neural activity represents modulation triggering ongoing circuit dynamics input signals rather directly reflecting structure input signal
