nf-kappa b blockade oncogenic ras trigger invasive human epidermal neoplasia 
nuclear factor nf-kappab oncogenic ras can alter proliferation epidermis common site human cancer12 proteins implicated epidermal squamous cell carcinoma mice3- however potential effects altering function uncertain whereas inhibition nf-kappab enhances apoptosis certain tumours6 blockade nf-kappab predisposes murine skin squamous cell carcinoma57 therapeutics inhibiting ras nf-kappab pathways developed treat human cancer89 essential assess effects altering regulators medical relevance murine studies limited however differences mouse human skin greater ease transforming murine cells show normal human epidermal cells nf-kappab oncogenic ras trigger cell-cycle arrest growth arrest triggered oncogenic ras can bypassed ikappabalpha-mediated blockade nf-kappab generating malignant human epidermal tissue resembling squamous cell carcinoma human cell tumorigenesis dependent laminin alpha6beta4 integrin thus ikappabalpha circumvents restraints growth promotion induced oncogenic ras can act ras induce invasive human tissue neoplasia
