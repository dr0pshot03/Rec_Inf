selective small-molecule inhibition rna structural element 
riboswitches non-coding rna structures located messenger rnas bind endogenous ligands specific metabolite ion regulate gene expression riboswitches serve novel yet largely unexploited class emerging drug targets demonstrating potential however proven difficult restricted structurally similar antimetabolites semi-synthetic analogues cognate ligand thus greatly restricting chemical space selectivity sought inhibitors report discovery characterization ribocil highly selective chemical modulator bacterial riboflavin riboswitches identified phenotypic screen acts structurally distinct synthetic mimic natural ligand flavin mononucleotide repress riboswitch-mediated ribb gene expression inhibit bacterial cell growth findings indicate non-coding rna structural elements may broadly targeted synthetic small molecules previously expected
