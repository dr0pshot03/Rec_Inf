combinatorial shca docking interactions support diversity tissue morphogenesis
changes protein-protein interactions may allow polypeptides perform unexpected regulatory functions mammalian shca docking proteins amino-terminal phosphotyrosine ptyr binding ptb carboxyl-terminal src homology sh2 domains recognize specific ptyr sites activated receptors central region two phosphorylated tyrosine-x-asparagine pyxn motifs x represents amino acid bind growth factor receptor-bound protein grb2 adaptor phylogenetic analysis indicates shca may signal pyxn-dependent independent pathways show mice cardiomyocyte-expressed shca directs mid-gestational heart development ptb-dependent mechanism require pyxn motifs contrast pyxn motifs required ptb sh2 domains shca molecule formation muscle spindles skeletal muscle sensory organs regulate motor behavior thus combinatorial differences shca docking interactions may yield multiple signaling mechanisms support diversity tissue morphogenesis
