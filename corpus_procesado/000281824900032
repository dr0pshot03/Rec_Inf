observation spin-dependent quantum jumps via quantum dot resonance fluorescence
reliable preparation manipulation measurement protocols necessary exploit physical system quantum bit spins optically active quantum dots offer one potential realization recent demonstrations shown high-fidelity preparation ultrafast coherent manipulation- final challenge-that single-shot measurement electron spin-has proved difficult three far time-averaged optical measurements reported- main obstacle optical spin readout single quantum dots laser probes spin state also flips spin measured using gate-controlled quantum dot molecule- present ability measure spin state single electron real time via intermittency quantum dot resonance fluorescence quantum dot molecule unlike single quantum dot counterpart allows separate independent optical transitions state preparation manipulation measurement avoiding dilemma relying transition address spin state electron
