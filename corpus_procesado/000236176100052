molecular analogues variety mechanical devices shuttles brakes unidirectional rotors tweezers created- molecular machines yet used mechanically manipulate second molecule controlled reversible manner show light-induced scissor-like conformational changes one molecule can give rise mechanical twisting non-covalently bound guest molecule realize coupling molecular motions use previously designed system: ferrocene moiety azobenzene strap end attached one two cyclopentadienyl rings ferrocene unit acts pivot photoisomerization strap rotates ferrocene rings relative thereby also changes relative position two pedal moieties attached ferrocene rings translate effect intermolecular coupling motion endowing pedals binding sites allow host system form stable complex bidentate rotor molecule using circular dichroism spectroscopy show photoinduced conformational changes host indeed transmitted induce mechanical twisting rotor molecule design concept significantly extends successful coupling motion beyond intramolecular level seen synthetic allosteric receptors might allow remote control molecular events larger interlocked molecular systems
