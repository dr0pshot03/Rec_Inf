calcium activation bkca potassium channels lacking calcium bowl rck domains
many physiological systems neurotransmitter release smooth muscle relaxation frequency tuning auditory hair cells large-conductance calcium-activated potassium bkca channels create connection calcium signalling pathways membrane excitability- bkca channels activated voltage micromolar concentrations intracellular calcium although possible open bkca channels absence calcium- calcium binding essential activation physiological conditions presence intracellular calcium bkca channels open negative membrane potentials- many experiments investigating molecular mechanism calcium activation bkca channel focused large intracellular carboxy terminus much evidence supports hypothesis calcium-binding sites located region channel show bkca channels lack whole intracellular c terminus retain wild-type calcium sensitivity results show intracellular c terminus including calcium bowl rck domain necessary calcium-activated opening channels
