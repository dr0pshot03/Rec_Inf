universal trend amino acid gain loss protein evolution 
amino acid composition proteins varies substantially taxa thus can evolve example proteins organisms g+c rich a+t rich genomes contain fewer amino acids encoded g+c rich codons however universal trends ongoing changes amino acid frequencies reported compared sets orthologous proteins encoded triplets closely related genomes taxa representing three domains life bacteria archaea eukaryota used phylogenies polarize amino acid substitutions cys met ser phe accrue least taxa whereas pro ala glu gly consistently lost nine amino acids currently accrued lost human proteins shown analysis non synonymous single-nucleotide polymorphisms amino acids declining frequencies thought among first incorporated genetic code conversely amino acids increasing frequencies except ser probably recruited late thus expansion initially represented amino acids began million years ago apparently continues day
