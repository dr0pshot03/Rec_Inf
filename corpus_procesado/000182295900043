aerodynamics free-flight maneuvers drosophila 
using three-dimensional infrared high-speed video captured wing body kinematics free-flying fruitflies performed rapid flight maneuvers "replayed" wing kinematics dynamically scaled robotic model measure aerodynamic forces produced wings results show fly generates rapid turns surprisingly subtle modifications wing motion nonetheless generate sufficient torque fly rotate body turn magnitude time course torque body motion rapid turns indicate inertia friction dominates flight dynamics insects
