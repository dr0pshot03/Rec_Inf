unprecedented nucleic acid capture mechanism excision dna damage
dna glycosylases remove alkylated deaminated purine nucleobases essential dna repair enzymes protect genome time confound cancer alkylation therapy excising cytotoxic n3-methyladenine bases formed dna-targeting anticancer compounds basis glycosylase specificity towards n3 n7-alkylpurines believed result intrinsic instability modified bases direct enzyme functional group chemistry present crystal structures recently discovered bacillus cereus alkd glycosylase complex dnas containing alkylated mismatched abasic nucleotides unlike glycosylases alkd captures extrahelical lesion solvent-exposed orientation providing illustration hydrolysis n3 n7-alkylated bases may facilitated increased lifetime dna helix structures supporting biochemical analysis base flipping catalysis reveal heat repeats alkd distort dna backbone detect non-watson-crick base pairs without duplex intercalation
