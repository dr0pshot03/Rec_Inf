neoarchean carbonate-associated sulfate records positive delta s- anomalies 
mass-independent fractionation sulfur isotopes reported delta s- recorded archean sedimentary rocks helps constrain composition earths early atmosphere timing rise oxygen similar billion years ago although current hypotheses predict uniformly negative delta s- archean seawater sulfate remains untested vast majority archean time applied x-ray absorption spectroscopy investigate low sulfate content particularly well-preserved neoarchean carbonates mass spectrometry measure delta s- signatures report unexpected large widespread positive delta s- values stratigraphic sections capturing million years diverse depositional environments combined pyrite record results show sulfate carry expected negative delta s- sulfur mass-independent fractionation neoarchean atmosphere
