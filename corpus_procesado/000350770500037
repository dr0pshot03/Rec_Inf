large-scale discovery novel genetic causes developmental disorders 
despite three decades successful predominantly phenotype-driven discovery genetic causes monogenic disorders half children severe developmental disorders probable genetic origin remain without genetic diagnosis particularly challenging disorders rare enough eluded recognition discrete clinical entity highly variable clinical manifestations difficult distinguish similar disorders demonstrate power using unbiased genotype-driven approach identify subsets patients similar disorders studying children severe undiagnosed developmental disorders parents using combination exome sequencing- array-based detection chromosomal rearrangements discovered novel genes associated developmental disorders newly implicated genes increase % % % proportion children diagnosed clustering missense mutations six newly implicated genes suggests normal development perturbed activating dominant-negative mechanism findings demonstrate value adopting comprehensive strategy genome-wide nationwide elucidate underlying causes rare genetic disorders
