ultrafast direct imprint nanostructures silicon 
fabrication micrometre nanometre-scale devices silicon typically involves lithography etching processes costly tend either limited resolution slow throughput recent work demonstrated possibility patterning substrates nanometre scale `imprinting directed self-assembly although etching step still required generate final structures devised demonstrate rapid technique patterning nanostructures silicon require etching technique-which call laser-assisted direct imprint ladia single excimer laser pulse melts thin surface layer silicon mould embossed resulting liquid layer variety structures resolution better nm imprinted silicon using ladi embossing time less ns high resolution speed ladi attribute molten silicons low viscosity one-third water open variety applications extended materials processing techniques
