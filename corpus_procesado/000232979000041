active control slow light chip photonic crystal waveguides
known light can slowed dispersive materials near resonances dramatic reduction light group velocity even bringing light pulses complete halt demonstrated recently various atomic- solid state systems- material absorption cancelled via quantum optical coherent effects- exploitation slow light phenomena potential applications ranging all-optical storage all-optical switching existing schemes however restricted narrow frequency range material resonance limits operation frequency maximum data rate storage capacity moreover implementation external lasers low pressures and/or low temperatures prevents miniaturization hinders practical applications experimentally demonstrate fold reduction group velocity silicon chip via ultra-compact photonic integrated circuit using low-loss silicon photonic crystal waveguides can support optical mode submicrometre cross-section addition show fast similar ns efficient mw electric power active control group velocity localized heating photonic crystal waveguide integrated micro-heater
