30s ribosomal subunit two primary functions protein synthesis discriminates aminoacyl transfer rnas match codon messenger rna thereby ensuring accuracy translation genetic message process called decoding also works 50s subunit move trnas associated mrna precisely one codon process called translocation describe functional implications high-resolution 30s crystal structure presented accompanying paper infer details interactions 30s subunit trna mrna ligands also describe crystal structure 30s subunit complexed antibiotics paromomycin streptomycin spectinomycin interfere decoding translocation work reveals structural basis action antibiotics leads model role universally conserved 16s rna residues a1492 a1493 decoding process
