flux small near-earth objects colliding earth
asteroids diameters smaller similar to50 m collide earth usually hit ground single body rather detonate atmosphere small objects can still cause considerable damage occurred near tunguska siberia flux small bodies poorly constrained however part ground-based observational searches pursue strategies lead preferentially find larger objects atunguska-class event energy take equivalent megatons tnt previously estimated occur every years largest annual airburst calculated similar to20 kilotons kton tnt equivalent ref report satellite records bolide detonations atmosphere past years find flux objects -m size range power-law distribution bodies diameters > m estimate earth hit average annually object similar to5 kton equivalent energy tunguska-like events occur every years
