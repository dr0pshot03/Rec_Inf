integrated map genetic variation human genomes
characterizing geographic functional spectrum human genetic variation genomes project aims build resource help understand genetic contribution disease describe genomes individuals populations constructed using combination low-coverage whole-genome exome sequencing developing methods integrate information across several algorithms diverse data sources provide validated haplotype map million single nucleotide polymorphisms million short insertions deletions larger deletions show individuals different populations carry different profiles rare common variants low-frequency variants show substantial geographic differentiation increased action purifying selection show evolutionary conservation coding consequence key determinants strength purifying selection rare-variant load varies substantially across biological pathways individual contains hundreds rare non-coding variants conserved sites motif-disrupting changes transcription-factor-binding sites resource captures % accessible single nucleotide polymorphisms frequency % related populations enables analysis common low-frequency variants individuals diverse including admixed populations
