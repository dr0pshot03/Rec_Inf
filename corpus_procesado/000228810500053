comparative metagenomics microbial communities 
species complexity microbial communities challenges culturing representative isolates make difficult obtain assembled genomes characterize compare metabolic capabilities terrestrial marine microbial communities using largely unassembled sequence data obtained shotgun sequencing dna isolated various environments quantitative gene content analysis reveals habitat-specific fingerprints reflect known characteristics sampled environments identification environment-specific genes gene-centric comparative analysis presents new opportunities interpreting diagnosing environments
