spread model climate sensitivity traced atmospheric convective mixing 
equilibrium climate sensitivity refers ultimate change global mean temperature response change external forcing despite decades research attempting narrow uncertainties equilibrium climate sensitivity estimates climate models still span roughly degrees celsius doubling atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration precluding accurate projections future climate spread arises largely differences feedback low clouds reasons yet understood show differences simulated strength convective mixing lower middle tropical troposphere explain half variance climate sensitivity estimated climate models apparent mechanism mixing dehydrates low-cloud layer rate increases climate warms rate increase depends initial mixing strength linking mixing cloud feedback mixing inferred observations appears sufficiently strong imply climate sensitivity degrees doubling carbon dioxide significantly higher currently accepted lower bound degrees thereby constraining model projections towards relatively severe future warming
