single class olfactory neurons mediates behavioural responses drosophila sex pheromone
insects like many animals use sex pheromones coordinate reproductive behaviours volatile pheromones detected odorant receptors expressed olfactory receptor neurons orns whereas fruit odours typically activate multiple orn classes pheromones thought act single dedicated classes orn3 model predicts activation orn class sufficient trigger appropriate behavioural response show drosophila melanogaster male-specific pheromone cis-vaccenyl acetate cva acts receptor or67d regulate male female mating behaviour mutant males lack or67d inappropriately court males whereas mutant females less receptive courting males data suggest cva opposite effects two sexes: inhibiting mating behaviour males promoting mating behaviour females replacing or67d moth pheromone receptors renders orns sensitive corresponding moth pheromones flies moth pheromones elicit behavioural responses mimic normal response cva thus activation single orn class necessary sufficient mediate behavioural responses drosophila sex pheromone cva
