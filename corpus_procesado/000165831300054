rapid exchange histone h1 chromatin living human cells 
considerable length dna eukaryotic genomes requires packaging chromatin rt inside small dimensions cell nucleus histone h1 functions compaction chromatin higher order structures derived repeating beads string nucleosome polymer modulation h1 binding activity thought important step potentiation/depotentiation chromatin structure transcription- generally accepted h1 binds less tightly histones dna chromatin can readily exchange living cells- fusion proteins histone h1 green fluorescent protein gfp shown associate chromatin apparently identical fashion native histone h1 provides means study histone h1-chromatin interactions living cells used human cells stably integrated h1-gfp fusion protein monitor histone h1 movement directly fluorescence recovery photobleaching living cells rnd exchange rapid condensed decondensed chromatin occurs throughout cell cycle require fibre-fibre interactions treatment drugs alter protein phosphorylation significantly reduces exchange rates results show histone h1 exchange vivo rapid occurs soluble intermediate modulated phosphorylation protein proteins yet determined
