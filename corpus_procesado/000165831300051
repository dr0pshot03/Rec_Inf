high constitutive activity native h receptors regulates histamine neurons brain
g-protein-coupled receptors display constitutive activity spontaneous activity absence agonist- means proportion receptor population spontaneously undergoes allosteric transition leading conformation can bind g proteins process shown occur recombinant receptors expressed high density and/or mutated also non-mutated recombinant receptors expressed physiological concentrations- transgenic mice express constitutively active mutant beta -adrenergic receptor display cardiac anomalies spontaneous receptor mutations leading constitutive activity origin human diseases nevertheless process previously found occur animals expressing normal levels receptor show two isoforms recombinant rat h receptor display high constitutive activity using drugs abrogate activity inverse agonists drug opposes agonists inverse agonists neutral antagonist show constitutive activity native h receptors present rodent brain controls histaminergic neuron activity vivo inverse agonists may therefore rnd therapeutic applications even case diseases involving non-mutated receptors expressed normal levels
