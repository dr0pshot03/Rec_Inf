high constitutive activity native h3 receptors regulates histamine neurons brain 
g-protein-coupled receptors display constitutive activity spontaneous activity absence agonist1- means proportion receptor population spontaneously undergoes allosteric transition leading conformation can bind g proteins3 process shown occur recombinant receptors expressed high density and/or mutated also non-mutated recombinant receptors expressed physiological concentrations5- transgenic mice express constitutively active mutant beta -adrenergic receptor display cardiac anomalies8; spontaneous receptor mutations leading constitutive activity origin human diseases910 nevertheless process previously found occur animals expressing normal levels receptor34 show two isoforms recombinant rat h3 receptor1112 display high constitutive activity using drugs abrogate activity inverse agonists drug opposes agonists inverse agonists neutral antagonist show constitutive activity native h3 receptors present rodent brain controls histaminergic neuron activity vivo inverse agonists may therefore rnd therapeutic applications even case diseases involving non-mutated receptors expressed normal levels
