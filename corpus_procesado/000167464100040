brown dwarfs massive enough sustain thermonuclear fusion hydrogen centres distinguished gas-giant planets ability burn deuterium brown dwarfs older similar myr expected possess short-lived magnetic fields emit radio x-rays weakly coronae x-ray flare recently detected brown dwarf lp944- whereas previous searches- optical activity one x-ray search yielded negative results report discovery quiescent flaring radio emission lp944- luminosities several orders magnitude larger predicted empirical relation x-ray radio luminosities found many types stars interpreting radio data within context synchrotron emission show lp944 unusually weak magnetic field comparison active m-dwarf stars might explain previous null optical- x-ray results well strength radio emissions compared x-ray wavelengths
