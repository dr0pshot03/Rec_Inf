aztec arithmetic revisited: land-area algorithms acolhua congruence arithmetic 
acolhua-aztec land records depicting areas side dimensions agricultural fields provide insight aztec arithmetic hypothesizing recorded areas resulted indigenous calculation study sample quadrilateral fields found % area values reproduced exactly computation remaining cases discrepancies computed recorded areas consistently small suggesting use unknown indigenous arithmetic revisiting research discovered evidence use congruence principles based proportions standard linear acolhua measure units shorter length procedure substitutes computation fractions labeled acolhua congruence arithmetic findings also clarify variance acolhua tenochca linear units long issue understanding aztec metrology
