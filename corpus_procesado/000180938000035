dynein structure power stroke 
dynein atpases microtubule motors critical diverse processes vesicle transport beating sperm tails however mechanism force generation unknown dynein comprises head stalk stem emerge use electron microscopy image processing reveal new structural details dynein c isoform chlamydomonas reinhardtii flagella start end power stroke stem stalk flexible stem connects head means linker approximately nm long propose lies across head adp vanadate bound stem stalk emerge head nm apart however without nucleotide emerge much closer together owing change linker orientation coiled-coil stalk becomes stiffer net result shortening molecule coupled approximately nm displacement tip stalk changes indicate mechanism dynein power stroke
