superoxide activates mitochondrial uncoupling proteins
uncoupling protein ucp1 diverts energy atp synthesis thermogenesis mitochondria brown adipose tissue catalysing regulated leak protons across inner membrane functions homologues ucp2 ucp3 tissues debated ucp2 ucp3 present much lower abundance ucp1 uncoupling associated significantly thermogenic mild uncoupling however decrease mitochondrial production reactive oxygen species important mediators oxidative damage show superoxide increases mitochondrial proton conductance effects ucp1 ucp2 ucp3 superoxide-induced uncoupling requires fatty acids inhibited purine nucleotides correlates tissue expression ucps appears mitochondria yeast expressing ucp1 absent skeletal muscle mitochondria ucp3 knockout mice findings indicate interaction superoxide ucps may mechanism decreasing concentrations reactive oxygen species inside mitochondria
