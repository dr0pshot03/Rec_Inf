crystal structure recbcd enzyme reveals machine processing dna breaks 
recbcd multi-functional enzyme complex processes dna ends resulting double-strand break recbcd bipolar helicase splits duplex component strands digests encountering recombinational hotspot chi site nuclease activity attenuated recbcd loads reca onto tail dna present crystal structure recbcd bound dna substrate initiation complex dna duplex split across recc subunit create fork separated strands heading towards different helicase motor subunits strands pass along tunnels within complex emerging adjacent nuclease domain recb passage tail one tunnels provides mechanism recognition chi sequence recc within context double-stranded dna gating tunnel suggests nuclease activity might regulated
