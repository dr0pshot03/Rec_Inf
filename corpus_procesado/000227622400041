chaperone activity protein o-fucosyltransferase promotes notch receptor folding 
notch proteins receptors conserved signaling pathway affects numerous cell fate decisions found drosophila protein o-fucosyltransferase ofut1 enzyme glycosylates epidermal growth factor-like domains notch also distinct notch chaperone activity ofut1 endoplasmic reticulum protein localization essential function vivo ofut1 bind notch required trafficking wild-type notch endoplasmic reticulum partially rescue defects secretion ligand binding associated notch point mutations ability ofut1 facilitate folding notch require fucosyltransferase activity thus glycosyltransferase can bind substrate endoplasmic reticulum facilitate normal folding
