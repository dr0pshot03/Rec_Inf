hexameric structure assembly interleukin-/il- alpha-receptor/gp130 complex 
interleukin- il- immunoregulatory cytokine activates cell-surface signaling assembly composed il- il- alpha-receptor il-6ralpha shared signaling receptor gp130 angstrom resolution structure extracellular signaling complex reveals hexameric interlocking assembly mediated total symmetry-related thermodynamically coupled interfaces assembly hexameric complex occurs sequentially: il- rst engaged il-6ralpha presented gp130 proper geometry facilitate cooperative transition high-affinity signaling-competent hexamer quaternary structures il-/il- family signaling complexes likely constructed means similar topological blueprint
