deep stable interferometric nulling broadband light implications observing planets around nearby stars 
number indirectly detected planetary systems around nearby stars grown tremendously since initial discovery five years ago1 direct observation light reflected systems remains formidable task high contrast ratios parent stars tiny angular separations theoretically2 difficulties can overcome using dual-aperture stellar interferometer starlight cancelled nulled broadband destructive interference leaving planets light visible although basic requirement equal oppositely directed electric fields easy state experimental demonstration deep broadband nulling lacking owing difficulties engendered needs extreme symmetry stability low dispersion optical system report deep - stable nulling broadband % bandwidth thermal light results validate physical principles underlying future planet-searching interferometers laboratory instrument will serve prototype nulling instrument implemented keck interferometer
