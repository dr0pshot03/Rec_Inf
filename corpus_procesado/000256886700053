bora kinase aurora cooperatively activate kinase plk1 control mitotic entry 
central question study cell proliferation controls cell cycle transitions although accumulation mitotic cyclins drives transition g phase m phase embryonic cells trigger mitotic entry somatic cells remains unknown report synergistic action bora kinase aurora aur controls g m transition bora accumulates g phase promotes aur mediated activation polo like kinase plk1 leading activation cyclin dependent kinase mitotic entry mechanistically bora interacts plk1 controls accessibility activation loop phosphorylation activation aur thus bora aur control mitotic entry provides mechanism one important yet ill defined events cell cycle
