selective c-h fluorination pyridines diazines inspired classic amination reaction 
fluorinated heterocycles prevalent pharmaceuticals agrochemicals materials however reactions incorporate fluorine heteroarenes limited scope can hazardous present broadly applicable safe method site-selective fluorination single carbon-hydrogen bond pyridines diazines using commercially available silverii fluoride reactions occur ambient temperature within hour exclusive selectivity fluorination adjacent nitrogen mild conditions allow access fluorinated derivatives medicinally important compounds well range -substituted pyridines prepared subsequent nucleophilic displacement fluoride mechanistic studies demonstrate pathway classic pyridine amination can adapted selective fluorination broad range nitrogen heterocycles
