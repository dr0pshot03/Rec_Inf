cdc48 ubiquitin ligase drive disassembly cmg helicase end dna replication 
chromosome replication initiated universal mechanism eukaryotic cells involving assembly activation replication origins cmg cdc45-mcm-gins dna helicase essential progression replication forks disassembly cmg likely key regulated step end chromosome replication mechanism unknown now show ubiquitin ligase known scfdia2 promotes ubiquitylation cmg final stages chromosome replication saccharomyces cerevisiae cdc48/p97 segregase associates ubiquitylated cmg leading rapidly helicase disassembly findings indicate end chromosome replication eukaryotes controlled similarly complex fashion much-better-characterized initiation step
