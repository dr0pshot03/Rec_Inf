sharper images focusing soft x-rays photon sieves 
fresnel zone plates consisting alternating transmissive opaque circular rings can used focus x-rays spatial resolution can achieved devices order width outermost zone therefore limited smallest structure nm can fabricated lithography today show large number pinholes distributed appropriately fresnel zones make possible focus soft x-rays spot sizes smaller diameter smallest pinhole addition higher orders diffraction secondary maxima can suppressed several orders magnitude combination next generation synchrotron light sources free-electron lasers photon sieves offer new opportunities high-resolution x-ray microscopy spectroscopy physical life sciences
