specific mutations induced triplex-forming oligonucleotides mice
tripler-forming oligonucleotides tfos recognize bind specific duplex dna sequences used extensively modify gene function cells although germ line mutations can incorporated means embryonic stem cell technology little progress made toward introducing mutations somatic cells living organisms demonstrate tfos can induce mutations specific genomic sites somatic cells adult mice mutation detection facilitated use transgenic mice bearing chromosomal copies supf cll reporter genes mice treated supf-targeted tfo displayed fivefold greater mutation frequencies supf gene compared mice treated scrambled sequence control oligomer mutagenesis detected control gene cll either oligonucleotide results demonstrate site-specific tfo-directed genome modification can accomplished intact animals
