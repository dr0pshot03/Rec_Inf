overexpression alpha2a-adrenergic receptors contributes type diabetes 
several common genetic variations associated type diabetes exact disease mechanisms still poorly elucidated using congenic strains diabetic goto-kakizaki rat identified -megabase genomic locus linked impaired insulin granule docking plasma membrane reduced beta cell exocytosis locus adra2a encoding alpha2a-adrenergic receptor [alpha2aar] significantly overexpressed alpha2a ar mediates adrenergic suppression insulin secretion pharmacological receptor antagonism silencing receptor expression blockade downstream effectors rescued insulin secretion congenic islets furthermore identified single-nucleotide polymorphism human adra2a gene risk allele carriers exhibited overexpression alpha2a ar reduced insulin secretion increased type diabetes risk human pancreatic islets risk allele carriers exhibited reduced granule docking secreted less insulin response glucose; effects counteracted pharmacological alpha2a ar antagonists
