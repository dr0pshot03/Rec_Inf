potential respiratory droplet-transmissible a/h5n1 influenza virus evolve mammalian host 
avian a/h5n1 influenza viruses pose pandemic threat five amino acid substitutions four reassortment might sufficient mammal-to-mammal transmission respiratory droplets surveillance data found two substitutions common a/h5n1 viruses thus viruses might require three additional substitutions become transmissible via respiratory droplets mammals used mathematical model within-host virus evolution study factors increase decrease probability remaining substitutions evolving virus infected mammalian host factors combined presence substitutions circulating strains make virus evolving nature potentially serious threat results highlight critical areas data needed assessing potentially averting threat
