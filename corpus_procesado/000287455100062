microtubule stabilization reduces scarring causes axon regeneration spinal cord injury 
hypertrophic scarring poor intrinsic axon growth capacity constitute major obstacles spinal cord repair processes tightly regulated microtubule dynamics moderate microtubule stabilization decreased scar formation spinal cord injury rodents various cellular mechanisms including dampening transforming growth factor-beta signaling prevented accumulation chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans rendered lesion site permissive axon regeneration growth-competent sensory neurons microtubule stabilization also promoted growth central nervous system axons raphe-spinal tract led functional improvement thus microtubule stabilization reduces fibrotic scarring enhances capacity axons grow
