atomic inner-shell x-ray laser nanometres pumped x-ray free-electron laser
since invention laser years ago scientists striven achieve amplification atomic transitions increasingly shorter wavelength- introduction x-ray free-electron lasers- makes possible pump new atomic x-ray lasers- ultrashort pulse duration extreme spectral brightness full temporal coherence describe implementation x-ray laser kiloelectronvolt energy regime based atomic population inversion driven rapid k-shell photo-ionization using pulses x-ray free-electron laser established population inversion k alpha transition singly ionized neon nanometres corresponding photon energy electronvolts elongated plasma column created irradiation gas medium observed strong amplified spontaneous emission end excited plasma resulted femtosecond-duration high-intensity x-ray pulses much shorter wavelength greater brilliance achieved previous atomic x-ray lasers moreover scheme provides greatly increased wavelength stability monochromaticity improved temporal coherence comparison present-day x-ray free-electron lasers atomic x-ray lasers realized may useful high-resolution spectroscopy nonlinear x-ray studies
