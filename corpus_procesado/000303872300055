recent explosive human population growth resulted excess rare genetic variants
human populations experienced recent explosive growth expanding least three orders magnitude past generations departure equilibrium skews patterns genetic variation distorts basic principles population genetics characterized empirical signatures explosive growth site frequency spectrum found discrepancy rare variant abundance across demographic modeling studies mostly due differences sample size rapid recent growth increases load rare variants likely play role individual genetic burden complex disease risk hence extreme recent human population growth needs taken consideration studying genetics complex diseases traits
