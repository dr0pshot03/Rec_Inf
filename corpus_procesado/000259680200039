surface-modified carbon nanotubes catalyze oxidative dehydrogenation n-butane 
butenes butadiene useful intermediates synthesis polymers compounds synthesized traditionally oxidative dehydrogenation odh n butane complex metal oxides catalysts require high o2/ butane ratios maintain activity leads unwanted product oxidation show carbon nanotubes modified surface functionality efficiently catalyze oxidative dehydrogenation n butane butenes especially butadiene low o2/ butane ratios high selectivity alkenes achieved periods long hours process mildly catalyzed ketonic c o groups occurs via combination parallel sequential oxidation steps small amount phosphorus greatly improved selectivity suppressing combustion hydrocarbons
