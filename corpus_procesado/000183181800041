atomic resolution imaging carbon nanotube diffraction intensities
atomic imaging three-dimensional structures required crystal diffraction lens electron imaging whereas diffraction achieves high resolution averaging many cells imaging gives localized structural information position single dopant atom however lens aberrations limit electron imaging resolution angstrom resolution reduced low contrast weak scattering limitations electron dose radiation-sensitive molecules show high resolution high contrast can achieved imaging diffraction nanometer-sized coherent electron beam phase problem solved oversampling iterative phase retrieval apply technique image double-wall carbon nanotube angstrom resolution revealing structure two tubes different helicities requirement imaging diffraction pattern sampled nyquist frequency technique potential image nonperiodic nanostructures including biological macromolecules diffraction intensity-limited resolutions
