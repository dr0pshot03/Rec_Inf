enhanced gravi phototropism plant mdr mutants mislocalizing auxin efflux protein pin1
many aspects plant growth development dependent flow hormone auxin plant growing shoot tip synthesized direction auxin transport stems believed result basal localization within cells pin1 membrane protein controls efflux auxin anion mutations two genes homologous encoding p-glycoprotein abc transporters especially abundant multidrug-resistant tumour cells animals recently shown block polar auxin transport hypocotyls arabidopsis seedlings show mdr mutants display faster greater gravitropism enhanced phototropism instead impaired curvature development expected mutants lacking polar auxin transport find phenotypes result disruption normal accumulation pin1 protein along basal end hypocotyl cells associated basipetal auxin flow lateral auxin conductance becomes relatively larger result enhancing growth differentials responsible tropic responses
