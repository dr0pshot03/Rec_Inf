fluctuation superconductivity mesoscopic aluminum rings 
fluctuations important near phase transitions can difficult describe quantitatively superconductivity mesoscopic rings particularly intriguing critical temperature oscillatory function magnetic field exact theory thermal fluctuations one-dimensional superconducting rings therefore expected excellent model system measured susceptibility many rings one ring time using scanning superconducting quantum interference device can isolate magnetic signals seven orders magnitude smaller applied flux find fluctuation theory describes results single parameter characterizes ways fluctuations especially important magnetic fields critical temperature suppressed
