cladogenesis morphological diversification passerine birds 
morphological diversity tends increase within evolving lineages time12 relative roles gradual evolutionary change anagenesis3 abrupt shifts associated speciation events cladogenesis punctuated equilibrium4 resolved groups organisms5 however two modes evolution can distinguished fact morphological variance increases proportion time anagenesis6 proportion logarithm number species cladogenesis7 although species time correlated multiple regression analysis provides statistical framework partitioning relative contributions study use multiple regressions evaluate effects time species number morphological diversity within clades passerine birds results show clearly number species exerts strong influence morphological variance independent time time unique effect thus morphological evolution birds seems associated cladogenesis lineage splitting promotes morphological diversification poses important challenge ecologists evolutionary biologists
