decision-related activity sensory neurons reflects neurons causal effect 
perceptual decisions activity sensory neurons correlates subjects percept even physical stimulus identical1- origin correlation unknown current theory proposes causal effect noise sensory neurons perceptual decisions10- correlation result different brain states associated perceptual choice13 top-down explanation two schemes different implications role sensory neurons forming decisions14 use white-noise analysis15 measure tuning functions v2 neurons associated choice simultaneously measure variation stimulus affects subjects two macaques perceptual decisions16- causal models stronger effects stimulus upon decisions mediated sensory neurons associated stronger choice-related activity however find time course trial measures change different directions-at odds causal models analysis effect reward size also supports conclusion finally find choice associated changes neuronal gain incompatible causal models three results readily explained choice associated changes neuronal gain caused top-down phenomena closely resemble attention19 conclude top-down processes contribute choice-related activity thus even forming simple sensory decisions involves complex interactions cognitive processes sensory neurons
