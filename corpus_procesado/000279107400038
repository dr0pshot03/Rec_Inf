glass transition dynamics surface layer mobility unentangled polystyrene films
polymers solidify glassy amorphous state accompanied rapid increase viscosity cooled glass transition temperature tg ongoing debate whether tg changes decreasing polymer film thickness origin changes measured viscosity unentangled short-chain polystyrene films silicon different temperatures found transition temperature viscosity decreases decreasing film thickness consistent changes tg films observed applying hydrodynamic equations films data can explained presence highly mobile surface liquid layer follows arrhenius dynamic able dominate flow thinnest films studied
