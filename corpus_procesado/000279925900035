disordering organic overlayer metal surface upon cooling
inverse melting disordering disordered phase forms upon cooling known cases bulk systems high pressure show inverse disordering also occurs two dimensions: monolayer -naphthalene-tetracarboxylic dianhydride ag completely reversible order-disorder transition appears upon cooling transition driven strongly anisotropic interactions within layer versus metal substrate spectroscopic data reveal changes electronic structure system corresponding strengthening interface bonding low temperatures demonstrate delicate temperature-dependent balance vertical lateral forces key understanding unconventional phase transition
