using gene expression noise understand gene regulation 
phenotypic variation ubiquitous biology often traceable underlying genetic environmental variation however even genetically identical cells identical environments display variable phenotypes stochastic gene expression gene expression "noise" suggested major source variability physiological consequences topics intense research last decade several recent studies measured variability protein messenger rna levels discovered strong connections noise gene regulation mechanisms integrated discrete stochastic models measurements cell-to-cell variability provide sensitive "fingerprint" explore fundamental questions gene regulation review highlight several studies used gene expression variability develop quantitative understanding mechanisms dynamics gene regulation
