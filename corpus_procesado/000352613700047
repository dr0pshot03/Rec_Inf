preventing proteostasis diseases selective inhibition phosphatase regulatory subunit 
protein phosphorylation regulates virtually biological processes although protein kinases popular drug targets targeting protein phosphatases remains challenge describe sephin1 selective inhibitor holophosphatase small molecule safely selectively inhibited regulatory subunit protein phosphatase vivo sephin1 selectively bound inhibited stress-induced ppp1r15a related constitutive ppp1r15b prolong benefit adaptive phospho-signaling pathway protecting cells otherwise lethal protein misfolding stress vivo sephin1 safely prevented motor morphological molecular defects two otherwise unrelated protein-misfolding diseases mice charcot-marie-tooth 1b amyotrophic lateral sclerosis thus regulatory subunits phosphatases drug targets property exploited safely prevent two protein misfolding diseases
