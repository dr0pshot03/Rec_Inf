tnf receptor genetic risk mirrors outcome anti-tnf therapy multiple sclerosis
although much success identifying genetic variants associated common diseases using genome-wide association studies gwas difficult demonstrate variants causal role disease moreover modest contribution variants make disease risk raised questions regarding medical relevance investigated single nucleotide polymorphism snp tnfrsf1a gene encodes tumour necrosis factor receptor tnfr1 discovered gwas associated multiple sclerosis ms autoimmune conditions rheumatoid arthritis psoriasis crohns disease analysing ms gwas data conjunction genomes project data provide genetic evidence strongly implicates snp rs1800693 causal variant tnfrsf1a region substantiate functional studies showing ms risk allele directs expression novel soluble form tnfr1 can block tnf importantly tnf-blocking drugs can promote onset exacerbation ms9- proven highly efficacious treatment autoimmune diseases association rs1800693 indicates clinical experience drugs parallels disease association rs1800693 ms-associated tnfr1 variant mimics effect tnf-blocking drugs hence study demonstrates clinical practice can informed comparing gwas across common autoimmune diseases investigating functional consequences disease-associated genetic variation
