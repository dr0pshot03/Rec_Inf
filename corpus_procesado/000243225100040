direct estimation per nucleotide genomic deleterious mutation rates drosophila 
spontaneous mutations source genetic variation required evolutionary change therefore important many aspects evolutionary biology example divergence taxa neutrally evolving sites genome proportional per nucleotide mutation rate u ref can used date speciation events assuming molecular clock overall rate occurrence deleterious mutations genome generation u appears theories nucleotide divergence polymorphism evolution sex recombination evolutionary consequences inbreeding however estimates u based changes allozymes dna sequences fitness traits discordant- directly estimate u drosophila melanogaster scanning million bases dna three sets mutation accumulation lines using denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography mutation events detected obtained mean estimate u x - per generation moreover detected significant heterogeneity u among three mutation-accumulation-line genotypes multiplying u estimate fraction mutations deleterious natural populations drosophila estimate u per diploid genome high rate suggests selection deleterious mutations may key role explaining patterns genetic variation genome help maintain recombination sexual reproduction
