androgenetic haploid embryonic stem cells produce live transgenic mice 
haploids double haploids important resources studying recessive traits large impacts crop breeding natural haploids rare animals mammalian haploids restricted germline cells occasionally found tumours massive chromosome loss recent success establishing haploid embryonic stem es cells medaka fish mice raised possibility using engineered mammalian haploid cells genetic studies however availability functional characterization mammalian haploid es cells still limited show mouse androgenetic haploid es ahes cell lines can established transferring sperm enucleated oocyte ahes cells maintain haploidy stable growth passages express pluripotent markers possess ability differentiate three germ layers vitro vivo contribute germlines chimaeras injected blastocysts although epigenetically distinct sperm cells ahes cells can produce viable fertile progenies intracytoplasmic injection mature oocytes oocyte-injection procedure can also produce viable transgenic mice genetically engineered ahes cells findings show developmental pluripotency androgenentic haploids provide new tool quickly produce genetic models recessive traits may also shed new light assisted reproduction
