potential giant tsunamigenic earthquakes northern bay bengal 
great sumatra-andaman earthquake indian ocean tsunami came surprise earth science community although now widely recognized risk another giant earthquake high central sumatra just east earthquake seems relatively little concern subduction zone north northern bay bengal along coast myanmar show similar indicators suggest high potential giant earthquakes along coast myanmar indicators include tectonic environment similar subduction zones experience giant megathrust earthquakes stress crustal strain observations indicate seismogenic zone locked historical earthquake activity indicates giant tsunamigenic earthquakes occurred past consistent active subduction myanmar subduction zone suggest seismogenic zone extends beneath bengal fan conclude therefore giant earthquakes probably occur coast myanmar large vulnerable population thereby exposed significant earthquake tsunami hazard
