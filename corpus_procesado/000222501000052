frataxin acts iron chaperone protein modulate mitochondrial aconitase activity 
numerous degenerative disorders associated elevated levels pro-oxidants declines mitochondrial aconitase activity deficiency mitochondrial iron-binding protein frataxin results diminished activity various mitochondrial iron-sulfur proteins including aconitase found aconitase can undergo reversible citrate-dependent modulation activity response pro-oxidants frataxin interacted aconitase citrate-dependent fashion reduced level oxidant-induced inactivation converted inactive [3fe-4s]+ enzyme active [4fe-4s]+ form protein thus frataxin iron chaperone protein protects aconitase [4fe-4s]+ cluster disassembly promotes enzyme reactivation
