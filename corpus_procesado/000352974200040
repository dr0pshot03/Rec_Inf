evolutionary history lethal metastatic prostate cancer 
cancers emerge ongoing darwinian evolutionary process often leading multiple competing subdones within single primary tumour- evolutionary process culminates formation metastases cause % cancer-related deaths however despite clinical importance little known principles governing dissemination cancer cells distant organs although hypothesis metastasis originates single tumour cell generally supported- recent studies using mouse models cancer demonstrated existence polyclonal seeding interclonal cooperation multiple subdonee sought definitive evidence existence polydonal seeding human malignancy establish clonal relationship among different metastases context androgendeprived metastatic prostate cancer using whole-genome sequencing characterized multiple metastases arising prostate tumours ten patients integrated analyses subdonal architecture revealed patterns metastatic spread unprecedented detail metastasis-to-metastasis spread found common either de novo monoclonal seeding daughter metastases five cases transfer multiple tumour clones metastatic sites lesions affecting tumour suppressor genes usually occur single events whereas mutations genes involved androgen receptor signalling commonly involve multiple convergent events different metastases results elucidate detail complex patterns metastatic spread understanding development resistance androgen-deprivation therapy prostate cancer
