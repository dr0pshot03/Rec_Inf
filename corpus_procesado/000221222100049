mechanotransduction growth-factor shedding extracellular space 
physical forces elicit biochemical signalling diverse array cells tissues organisms1- helping govern fundamental biological processes several hypotheses advanced link physical forces intracellular signalling pathways many cases molecular mechanisms mechanotransduction remain elusive1- find compressive stress shrinks lateral intercellular space surrounding epithelial cells triggers cellular signalling via autocrine binding epidermal growth factor family ligands epidermal growth factor receptor mathematical analysis predicts constant rate shedding autocrine ligands collapsing lateral intercellular space leads increased local ligand concentrations sufficient account observed receptor signalling; direct experimental comparison signalling stimulated compressive stress versus exogenous soluble ligand supports prediction findings establish mechanism mechanotransduction arises autocrine ligand receptor circuit operating dynamically regulated extracellular volume requiring induction force-dependent biochemical processes within cell cell membrane
