solar wind origin coronal funnels 
origin solar wind solar coronal holes long unclear establish solar wind starts flowing corona heights photosphere megameters megameters magnetic funnels result obtained correlation doppler-velocity radiance maps spectral lines emitted various ions force-free magnetic field extrapolated photospheric magnetograms different attitudes specifically find ne7+ ions mostly radiate around megameters outflow speeds kilometers per second whereas c3+ ions average flow speed mainly radiate around s megameters based results model understanding solar wind origin suggested
