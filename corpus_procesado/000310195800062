vasopressin/oxytocin-related signaling regulates gustatory associative learning c elegans 
vasopressin oxytocin-related neuropeptides key regulators animal physiology including water balance reproduction although neuropeptides also modulate social behavior cognition mammals mechanism influencing behavioral plasticity evolutionary origin effects well understood present functional vasopressin oxytocin-like signaling system nematode caenorhabditis elegans activation receptor ntr- vasopressin/oxytocin-related neuropeptide designated nematocin facilitates experience-driven modulation salt chemotaxis type gustatory associative learning c elegans study suggests vasopressin oxytocin neuropeptides ancient roles modulating sensory processing neural circuits underlie behavioral plasticity
