somites without clock
formation body segments somites vertebrate embryos accompanied molecular oscillations segmentation clock interaction oscillator wave traveling along body axis clock-and-wavefront model generally believed control somite number size axial identity show clock-and-wavefront mechanism unnecessary somite formation non-somite mesoderm treated noggin generates many somites form simultaneously without cyclic expression notch-pathway genes yet normal size shape fate somites axial identity: hox code fixed independently somite fate however somites subdivided rostral caudal halves necessary neural segmentation propose somites self-organizing structures whose size shape controlled local cell-cell interactions
