reverse transcriptase-mediated tropism switching bordetella bacteriophage 
host-pathogen interactions often driven mechanisms promote genetic variability identified group temperate bacteriophages generate diversity gene designated mtd major tropism determinant specifies tropism receptor molecules host bordetella species tropism switching result template-dependent reverse transcriptase-mediated process introduces nucleotide substitutions defined locations within mtd cassette-based mechanism capable providing vast repertoire potential ligand-receptor interactions
