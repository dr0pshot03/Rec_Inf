improved surface temperature prediction coming decade global climate model 
previous climate model projections climate change accounted external forcing natural anthropogenic sources attempt predict internally generated natural variability present new modeling system predicts internal variability externally forced changes hence forecasts surface temperature substantially improved skill throughout decade globally many regions system predicts internal variability will partially offset anthropogenic global warming signal next years however climate will continue warm least half years predicted exceed warmest year currently record
