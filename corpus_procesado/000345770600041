agricultural green revolution driver increasing atmospheric co2 seasonal amplitude
atmospheric carbon dioxide co2 record displays prominent seasonal cycle arises mainly changes vegetation growth corresponding co2 uptake boreal spring summer growing seasons co2 release autumn winter seasons co2 seasonal amplitude increased past five decades suggesting increase northern hemisphere biospheric activity proposed vegetation growth may stimulated higher concentrations co2 well warming recent decades mechanisms unable explain full range magnitude observed increase co2 seasonal amplitude- suggest intensification agriculture green revolution much greater crop yield per unit area achieved hybridization irrigation fertilization past five decades driver changes seasonal characteristics global carbon cycle analysis co2 data atmospheric inversions shows robust per cent long-term increase co2 seasonal amplitude punctuated large decadal interannual variations using terrestrial carbon cycle model takes account high-yield cultivars fertilizer use irrigation find long-term increase co2 seasonal amplitude arises two major regions: midlatitude cropland degrees n degrees n high-latitude natural vegetation degrees n degrees n long-term trend seasonal amplitude increase +/ per cent per year sensitivity experiments attribute per cent land-use change climate variability change increased productivity due co2 fertilization respectively vegetation growth earlier one two weeks measured mid-point vegetation carbon uptake took petagrams carbon july height growing season suggesting human land use management contribute seasonal changes co2 exchange biosphere atmosphere
