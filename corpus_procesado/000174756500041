fin development cartilaginous fish origin vertebrate limbs
recent fossil finds experimental analysis chick mouse embryos highlighted lateral fin fold theory suggests two pairs limbs tetrapods evolved subdivision elongated single fin examine fin development embryos primitive cartilaginous fish scyliorhinus canicula dogfish using scanning electron microscopy investigate expression genes known involved limb positioning identity patterning higher vertebrates although detect lateral fin folds dogfish embryos engrailed expression suggests body compartmentalized dorsoventrally furthermore specification limb identity occurs tbx4 tbx5 genes higher vertebrates contrast unlike higher vertebrates detect shh transcripts dogfish fin-buds although dhand gene involved establishing shh expressed s canicula main fin axis seems lie parallel body axis freeing fins body axis establishing separate limb axis proposed crucial step evolution tetrapod limbs suggest shh plays critical role process
