dense magnetized plasma associated fast radio burst
fast radio bursts bright unresolved non-repeating broadband millisecond flashes found primarily high galactic latitudes dispersion measures much larger expected galactic source- inferred all-sky burst rate comparable core-collapse supernova rate redshift observed dispersion measures assumed dominated intergalactic medium sources cosmological distances redshifts refs parameters consistent wide range source models- one fast burst revealed circular polarization radio emission linear polarization detected hence faraday rotation measure determined report examination archival data revealing faraday rotation fast radio burst frb radio flux dispersion measure consistent values previously reported bursts accounting galactic contribution dispersion using model intergalactic electron density place source maximum redshift burst much higher rotation measure expected line sight milky way intergalactic medium indicating magnetization vicinity source within host galaxy pulse scattered two distinct plasma screens propagation requires either dense nebula associated source location within central region host galaxy detection instance magnetization scattering local source favours models involving young stellar populations magnetars models involving mergers older neutron stars likely located low-density regions host galaxy
