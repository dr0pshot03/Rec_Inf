heavy livestock grazing promotes locust outbreaks lowering plant nitrogen content 
current paradigms generally assume increased plant nitrogen n enhance herbivore performance relieving protein limitation increasing herbivorous insect populations show contrast scenario host plant n enrichment high-protein artificial diets decreased size viability oedaleus asiaticus dominant locust north asian grasslands locust preferred plants low n content artificial diets low protein high carbohydrate content plant n content lowest locust abundance highest heavily livestock-grazed fields soils n-depleted likely due enhanced erosion results suggest heavy livestock grazing consequent steppe degradation eurasian grassland promote outbreaks locust reducing plant protein content
