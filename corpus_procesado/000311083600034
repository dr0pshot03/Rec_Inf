multifunctional nanoparticles: cost versus benefit adding targeting imaging capabilities 
nanoparticle-based drug delivery systems developed improve efficacy reduce systemic toxicity wide range drugs although clinically approved nanoparticles consistently shown value reducing drug toxicity use always translated improved clinical outcomes led development multifunctional nanoparticles additional capabilities like targeting image contrast enhancement added nanoparticles however additional functionality means additional synthetic steps costs convoluted behavior effects vivo also greater regulatory hurdles trade-off additional functionality complexity subject ongoing debate focus review
