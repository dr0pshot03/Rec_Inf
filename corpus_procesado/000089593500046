mechanical model intraplate earthquakes: application new madrid seismic zone
present time-dependent model generation repeated intraplate earthquakes incorporates weak lower crustal zone within elastic lithosphere relaxation weak zone tectonic perturbations transfers stress overlying crust generating sequence earthquakes continues zone fully relaxes simulations predict large meters slip events recurrence intervals years cumulative offsets meters depending material parameters far-field stress magnitude consistent earthquake magnitude coseismic slip recurrence intervals cumulative offset surface deformation rates new madrid seismic zone computed interseismic strain rates may detectable available geodetic data implying low observed rates strain accumulation used rule future damaging earthquakes
