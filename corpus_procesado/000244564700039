hurricane intensity eyewall replacement 
observations made historic hurricane season document case "eyewall replacement" clouds outside hurricane eyewall coalesce form new eyewall greater radius storm center old eyewall dies winds new eyewall initially weaker original eyewall new eyewall contracts storm reintensifies understanding replacement mechanism vital forecasting variations hurricane intensity processes "moat" region new old eyewall particularly unclear aircraft data now show moat becomes dynamically similar eye thus converted region inimical survival inner eyewall suggest targeting aircraft key parts storm gain crucial input high-resolution numerical models can lead improvements forecasting hurricane intensity
