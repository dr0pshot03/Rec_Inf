attention awareness modulates bold signal human v1 binocular suppression
although recent psychophysical studies indicate visual awareness top-down attention two distinct processes clear neurally dissociated visual system using two-by-two factorial functional magnetic resonance imaging design binocular suppression found visibility invisibility visual target led nonsignificant blood oxygenation level-dependent bold effects human primary visual cortex v1 directing attention toward away target much larger robust effects across study participants difference lower-level limit bold activation attention awareness illustrates dissociated neural correlates two processes results agree previously reported v1 bold effects attention invite reconsideration functional role v1 visual awareness
