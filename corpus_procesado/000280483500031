probing superfluid-to-mott insulator transition single-atom level 
quantum gases optical lattices offer opportunity experimentally realize explore condensed matter models clean tunable system used single atom-single lattice site imaging investigate bose-hubbard model microscopic level technique enables space-and time-resolved characterization number statistics across superfluid-mott insulator quantum phase transition site-resolved probing fluctuations provides us sensitive local thermometer allows us identify microscopic heterostructures low-entropy mott domains enables us measure local quantum dynamics revealing surprisingly fast transition time scales results may serve benchmark theoretical studies quantum dynamics may guide engineering low-entropy phases lattice
