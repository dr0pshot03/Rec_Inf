stimulated emission polarization-entangled photons
entangled photon pairs-discrete light quanta exhibit nonclassical correlations-play crucial role quantum information science example demonstrations quantum non-locality- quantum teleportation quantum cryptography - macroscopic optical-field level non-classical correlations can also important case squeezed light entangled light beams teleportation continuous quantum variables use stimulated parametric down-conversion study entangled states light bridge gap discrete macroscopic optical quantum correlations demonstrate experimentally onset laser-like action entangled photons creation amplification spin-/ spin singlet states consisting two four photons respectively entanglement structure holds great promise quantum information science strong demand entangled states increasing complexity
