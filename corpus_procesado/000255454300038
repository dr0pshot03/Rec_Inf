coherent control decoherence
manipulation quantum interference requires system control remains coherent avoiding least postponing phase randomization can ensue coupling uncontrolled environment show closed loop coherent control can used mitigate rate quantum dephasing gas phase ensemble potassium dimers k- acts model system testing general concepts controlling decoherence specifically adaptively shaped light pulse used prepare vibrational wave packet electronically excited k- amplitude quantum beats fluorescence signal used easily measured surrogate purpose optimizing coherence optimal pulse increased beat amplitude noise level well thereby increased coherence life time compared beats produced transform limited pulse closed loop methods can thus effectively identify states robust dephasing without previous information system environment interaction
