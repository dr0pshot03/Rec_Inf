live imaging rnai screen reveals genes essential meiosis mammalian oocytes
fertilization egg sperm fuse form new embryo eggs develop oocytes process called meiosis meiosis inhuman oocytes highly error-prone defective eggs leading cause pregnancy loss several genetic disorders downs syndrome- genes safeguard accurate progression meiosis largely unclear develop high-content phenotypic screening methods systematic identification mammalian meiotic genes targeted genes rna interference within follicle-enclosed mouse oocytes block protein expression early stage oocyte development onwards analysed function several genes simultaneously high-resolution imaging chromosomes microtubules live oocytes scored oocyte quantitatively phenotypes generating comprehensive resource meiotic gene function screen generated unprecedented annotated data set meiotic progression mammalian oocytes allowed us analyse systematically defects linked abnormal chromosome segregation meiosis identifying progression anaphase misaligned chromosomes well defects spindle organization risk factors study demonstrates high-content screens can performed oocytes allows systematic studies meiosis mammals
