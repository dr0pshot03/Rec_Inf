hologenomic basis speciation: gut bacteria cause hybrid lethality genus nasonia
although gut microbiome influences numerous aspects organismal fitness role animal evolution origin new species largely unknown present evidence beneficial bacterial communities guts closely related species genus nasonia form species-specific phylosymbiotic assemblages cause lethality interspecific hybrids bacterial constituents abundance irregular hybrids relative parental controls antibiotic curing gut bacteria significantly rescues hybrid survival moreover feeding bacteria germ-free hybrids reinstates lethality recapitulates expression innate immune genes observed conventionally reared hybrids conclude animal complex gut microbiome host genome represent coadapted hologenome breaks hybridization promoting hybrid lethality assisting speciation
