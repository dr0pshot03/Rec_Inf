reverse engineering biological complexity 
advanced technologies biology extremely different physical implementations far alike systems-level organization widely appreciated convergent evolution domains produces modular architectures composed elaborate hierarchies protocols layers feedback regulation driven demand robustness uncertain environments use often imprecise components complexity may largely hidden idealized laboratory settings nor-mat operation becoming conspicuous contributing rare cascading failures puzzling paradoxical features neither accidental artificial derive deep necessary interplay complexity robustness modularity feedback fragility review describes insights engineering theory practice can shed tight biological complexity
