dual infection hiv malaria fuels spread diseases sub-saharan africa
mounting evidence revealed pathological interactions hiv malaria dually infected patients public health implications interplay remained unclear transient almost one-log elevation hiv viral load occurs febrile malaria episodes addition susceptibility malaria enhanced hiv-infected patients mathematical model applied setting kenya adult population roughly estimated since disease interaction may responsible excess hiv infections excess malaria episodes co-infection might also facilitated geographic expansion malaria areas hiv prevalence high hence transient repeated increases hiv viral load resulting recurrent co-infection malaria may important factor promoting spread hiv sub-saharan africa
