intestinal microbiota modulates anticancer immune effects cyclophosphamide 
cyclophosphamide one several clinically important cancer drugs whose therapeutic efficacy due part ability stimulate antitumor immune responses studying mouse models demonstrate cyclophosphamide alters composition microbiota small intestine induces translocation selected species gram-positive bacteria secondary lymphoid organs bacteria stimulate generation specific subset "pathogenic" t helper pth17 cells memory th1 immune responses tumor-bearing mice germ-free treated antibiotics kill gram-positive bacteria showed reduction pth17 responses tumors resistant cyclophosphamide adoptive transfer pth17 cells partially restored antitumor efficacy cyclophosphamide results suggest gut microbiota help shape anticancer immune response
