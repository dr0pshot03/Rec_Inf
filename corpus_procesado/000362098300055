aldehyde dehydrogenase 1a1 mediates gaba synthesis pathway midbrain dopaminergic neurons
midbrain dopamine neurons essential component basal ganglia circuitry playing key roles control fine movement reward recently demonstrated gamma-aminobutyric acid gaba chief inhibitory neurotransmitter co-released dopamine neurons show gaba co-release dopamine neurons use conventional gaba-synthesizing enzymes glutamate decarboxylases gad65 gad67 experiments reveal evolutionarily conserved gaba synthesis pathway mediated aldehyde dehydrogenase 1a1 aldh1a1 moreover gaba co-release modulated ethanol etoh concentrations seen blood alcohol binge drinking diminished aldh1a1 leads enhanced alcohol consumption preference findings provide insights functional role gaba co-release midbrain dopamine neurons may essential reward-based behavior addiction
