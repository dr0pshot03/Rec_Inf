partitioning regulatory mechanisms within-host malaria dynamics using effective propagation number
immune clearance resource limitation via red blood cell depletion shape peaks troughs malaria parasitemia turn affect disease severity transmission quantitatively partitioning relative roles effects time challenging using data rodent malaria estimated effective propagation number reflects relative importance contrasting within-host control mechanisms time sensitive inoculating parasite dose analysis showed capacity innate responses restrict initial parasite growth saturates parasite dose experimentally enhanced innate immunity can affect parasite density indirectly via resource depletion statistical approach offers tool improve targeting drugs vaccines human therapy revealing dynamics interactions within-host regulatory mechanisms
