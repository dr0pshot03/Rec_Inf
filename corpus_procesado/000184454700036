recyclable catalyst precipitates end reaction 
homogeneous catalysts-which exist usually liquid phase reactants products usually selective heterogeneous catalysts far less affected limitations due slow transport reactants products separation reaction products can costly inefficient stimulated development strategies facilitate recycling homogeneous catalysts- methods exploit preference catalyst one two solvents thermoregulated miscibility others exploit dramatic decrease catalyst solubility one reagent consumed temperature changed completion reaction- describe tungsten catalyst solvent-free hydrosilylation ketones retains activity essentially liquid substrate converted liquid products can simply decant separate catalyst precipitates products reaction attribute ability catalyst retain solubility hence activity completion reaction transient formation liquid clathrate contains molecules substrate per molecule otherwise solid catalyst insights fundamental processes controlling formation liquid clathrate might help tailor catalysts substrates develop efficient solvent-free schemes reactions practical interest
