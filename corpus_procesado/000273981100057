self versus non-self discrimination crispr rna-directed immunity 
immune systems must distinguish self non-self repel invaders without inducing autoimmunity clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat crispr loci protect bacteria archaea invasion phage plasmid dna genetic interference pathway- crispr loci present similar % similar % sequenced bacterial archaeal genomes respectively evolve rapidly acquiring new spacer sequences adapt highly dynamic viral populations- immunity requires sequence match invasive dna spacers lie crispr repeats- cluster genetically linked subset cas crispr-associated genes- collectively encode > families proteins involved adaptation interference crispr loci encode small crispr rnas crrnas contain full spacer flanked partial repeat sequences- crrna spacers thought identify targets direct watson-crick pairing invasive protospacer dna avoid targeting spacer dna within encoding crispr locus unknown defined mechanism crispr self/non-self discrimination staphylococcus epidermidis target/crrna mismatches specific positions outside spacer sequence license foreign dna interference whereas extended pairing crrna crispr dna repeats prevents autoimmunity hence crispr system uses base-pairing potential crrnas specify target also spare bacterial chromosome interference differential complementarity outside spacer sequence built-in feature crispr systems indicating mechanism broadly applicable solution self/non-self dilemma confronts immune pathways
