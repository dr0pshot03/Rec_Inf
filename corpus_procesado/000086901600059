structural insights stereochemistry cyclooxygenase reaction
cyclooxygenases bifunctional enzymes catalyse first committed step synthesis prostaglandins thromboxanes eicosanoids- two known cyclooxygenases isoforms share high degree amino-acid sequence similarity- structural topology- identical catalytic mechanism- cyclooxygenase enzymes catalyse two sequential reactions spatially distinct mechanistically coupled active sites- initial cyclooxygenase reaction converts arachidonic acid achiral prostaglandin g five chiral centres subsequent peroxidase reaction reduces prostaglandin g prostaglandin h- report co-crystal structures murine apo-cyclooxygenase complex arachidonic acid prostaglandin structures suggest molecular basis stereospecificity prostaglandin g synthesis
