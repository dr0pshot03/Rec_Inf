scaling bmp activation gradient xenopus embryos
groundbreaking experiments hans spemann demonstrated dorsal part amphibian embryo can generate well proportioned tadpole small group dorsal cells organizer can induce complete well proportioned twinned axis transplanted host embryo key organizer function localized secretion inhibitors bone morphogenetic protein bmp defines graded bmp activation profile although central proteins involved shaping gradient well characterized integrated function particular pattern scales size understood present evidence xenopus bmp activity gradient defined shuttling based mechanism whereby bmp ligands translocated ventrally association bmp inhibitor chordin shuttling feedback repression bmp ligand admp offers quantitative explanation spemanns observations accounts naturally scaling embryo pattern size
