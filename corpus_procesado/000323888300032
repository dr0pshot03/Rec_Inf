key tissue targets responsible anthrax-toxin-induced lethality 
bacillus anthracis causative agent anthrax disease lethal owing actions two exotoxins: anthrax lethal toxin lt oedema toxin et key tissue targets responsible lethal effects toxins unknown generated cell-type-specific anthrax toxin receptor capillary morphogenesis protein- cmg2-null mice cell-type-specific cmg2-expressing mice challenged toxins results show lethality induced lt et occurs damage distinct cell types; whereas targeting cardiomyocytes vascular smooth muscle cells required lt-induced mortality et-induced lethality occurs mainly action hepatocytes notably contradiction previously postulated targeting endothelial cells either toxin seem contribute significantly lethality findings demonstrate b anthracis evolved use lt et induce host lethality coordinately damaging two distinct vital systems
