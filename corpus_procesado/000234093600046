glial membranes node ranvier prevent neurite outgrowth 
nodes ranvier regularly placed nonmyelinated axon segments along myelinated nerves show nodal membranes isolated central nervous system cns mammals restricted neurite outgrowth cultured neurons proteomic analysis membranes revealed several inhibitors neurite outgrowth including oligodendrocyte myelin glycoprotein omgp rat spinal cord omgp localized compact myelin previously thought oligodendroglia-like cells whose processes converge form ring completely encircles nodes omgp-null mice cns nodes abnormally wide collateral sprouting observed nodal ensheathment cns may stabilize node prevent axonal sprouting
