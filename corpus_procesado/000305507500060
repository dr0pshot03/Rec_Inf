fancm limits meiotic crossovers
number meiotic crossovers cos tightly regulated within narrow range despite large excess molecular precursors factors limit cos remain largely unknown using genetic screen arabidopsis thaliana identified highly conserved fancm helicase required genome stability humans yeasts major factor limiting meiotic co formation fancm mutant threefold-increased co frequency compared wild type extra cos arise pathway accounts cos wild type alternate normally minor pathway thus fancm key factor imposing upper limit number meiotic cos manipulation holds much promise plant breeding
