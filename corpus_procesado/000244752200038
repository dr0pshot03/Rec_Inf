odor cues slow-wave sleep prompt declarative memory consolidation 
sleep facilitates memory consolidation widely held model assumes newly encoded memories undergo covert reactivation sleep cued new memories humans sleep presenting odor presented context prior learning showed reactivation indeed causes memory consolidation sleep re-exposure odor slow-wave sleep sws improved retention hippocampus-dependent declarative memories hippocampus-independent procedural memories odor re-exposure ineffective rapid eye movement sleep wakefulness odor omitted prior learning concurring findings functional magnetic resonance imaging revealed significant hippocampal activation response odor re-exposure sws
