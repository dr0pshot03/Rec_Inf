mechanical control morphogenesis fat/dachsous/four-jointed planar cell polarity pathway 
animal development several planar cell polarity pcp pathways control tissue shape coordinating collective cell behavior characterize means multiscale imaging epithelium morphogenesis drosophila dorsal thorax show fat/dachsous/four-jointed pcp pathway controls morphogenesis found proto-cadherin dachsous polarized within domain tissue-wide expression gradient furthermore dachsous polarizes myosin dachs turn promotes anisotropy junction tension combining physical modeling quantitative image analyses determined tension anisotropy defines pattern local tissue contraction contributes shaping epithelium mainly via oriented cell rearrangements results establish tissue planar polarization coordinates local changes cell mechanical properties control tissue morphogenesis
