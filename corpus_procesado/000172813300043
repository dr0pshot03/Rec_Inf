maternal control resting-egg production daphnia 
many planktonic organisms produce resting stages environmental conditions deteriorate like seeds resting stages can survive unfavourable conditions crustacean daphnia normally reproduces means parthenogenetically produced normal resting eggs-but occasionally switches bisexual reproduction results two resting eggs encased robust structure carried back female ephippium shed next moult can survive dormant many years induction resting-egg production requires multiple environmental stimuli one photoperiod switch production parthenogenetic eggs resting eggs daphnia recently shown influenced maternal food effect present evidence female daphnia transmit information food also photoperiod offspring influence production resting eggs next generation combined maternal effects can relevant correct timing resting-egg production-for example discriminating spring autumn conditions
