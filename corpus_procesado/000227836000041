evidence sensory traps can evolve honest signals 
conventional models- explaining extreme sexual ornaments propose reflect male genetic quality- arbitrary results genetic linkage female preference ornament chase-away model emphasizes sexual conflict: male signals attract females exploit receiver biases- males gain control mating decisions females may experience fitness costs suboptimal mating rates post-copulatory exploitation elaboration male signals expected females increase response threshold resist exploitation ornaments target otherwise adaptive biases feeding responses- selection females might eventually separate sexual non-sexual responses signal show terminal yellow band tyb several goodeinae species evokes feeding sexual responses sexual responsiveness phylogenetically pre-dates expression tyb males comparable across taxa yet feeding responsiveness decreases species elaborated tybs displaying tyb costly thus provides example trait arose sensory trap evolved honest signal
