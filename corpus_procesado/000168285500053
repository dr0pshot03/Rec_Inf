constans mediates circadian clock control flowering arabidopsis 
flowering often triggered exposing plants appropriate day lengths response requires endogenous timer called circadian clock measure duration day night timer also controls daily rhythms gene expression behavioural patterns leaf movements several arabidopsis mutations affect circadian processes flowering time- effect mutations circadian clock related influence flowering remains unknown show expression constans co gene accelerates flowering response long days modulated circadian clock day length expression co target gene called flowering locus t ft restricted similar time day expression co three mutations affect circadian rhythms flowering time alter co ft expression ways consistent effects flowering addition late flowering phenotype mutants corrected overexpressing co thus co acts circadian clock control flowering suggesting mechanisms day length regulates flowering time
