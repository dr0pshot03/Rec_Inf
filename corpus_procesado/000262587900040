brown clouds south asia: biomass fossil fuel combustion 
carbonaceous aerosols cause strong atmospheric heating large surface cooling important south asian climate forcing greenhouse gases yet aerosol sources poorly understood emission inventory models suggest biofuel burning accounts % emissions whereas elemental composition ambient aerosols points fossil fuel combustion used radiocarbon measurements winter monsoon aerosols western india indian ocean determine biomass combustion produced two thirds bulk carbonaceous aerosols well one half two thirds two black carbon subfractions respectively constraints show biomass combustion residential cooking agricultural burning fossil fuel combustion targeted mitigate climate effects improve air quality
