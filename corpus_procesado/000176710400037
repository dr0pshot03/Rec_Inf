local dispersal promotes biodiversity real-life game rock-paper-scissors
one central aims ecology identify mechanisms maintain biodiversity numerous theoretical models shown competing species can coexist ecological processes dispersal movement interaction occur small spatial scales- particular may case nontransitive communities without strict competitive hierarchies classic non-transitive system involves community three competing species satisfying relationship similar childrens game rock-paper-scissors rock crushes scissors scissors cuts paper paper covers rock relationships demonstrated several natural systems- models predict local interaction dispersal sufficient ensure coexistence three species community whereas diversity lost ecological processes occur larger scales test predictions empirically using non-transitive model community containing three populations escherichia coli find diversity rapidly lost experimental community dispersal interaction occur relatively large spatial scales whereas populations coexist ecological processes localized
