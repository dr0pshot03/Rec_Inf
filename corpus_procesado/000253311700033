nuclear coupling polarization molecular transport junctions: beyond tunneling function 
much current experimental research transport molecular junctions focuses finite voltages substantial polarization induced nonlinearities may result technologically relevant device type responses molecules strong polarization responses changing charge state external field molecules isolated electrodes can show strongly nonlinear current voltage responses small applied voltages similar volt weak interaction transporting electrons molecular vibrations provides basis inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy higher voltages certain time scale regimes strong coupling effects occur including coulomb blockade negative differential resistance dynamical switching switching noise current hysteresis heating chemical reactions discuss general picture phenomena arise charging strong correlation polarization electronic vibrational effects molecule interface
