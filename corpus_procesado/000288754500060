fgf19 postprandial insulin-independent activator hepatic protein glycogen synthesis
fibroblast growth factor fgf enterokine synthesized released bile acids taken ileum show fgf19 stimulates hepatic protein glycogen synthesis induce lipogenesis effects fgf19 independent activity either insulin protein kinase akt instead mediated mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway activates components protein translation machinery stimulates glycogen synthase activity mice lacking fgf15 mouse fgf19 ortholog fail properly maintain blood concentrations glucose normal postprandial amounts liver glycogen fgf19 treatment restored loss glycogen diabetic animals lacking insulin thus fgf19 activates physiologically important insulin-independent endocrine pathway regulates hepatic protein glycogen metabolism
