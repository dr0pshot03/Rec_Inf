genetic ablation parathyroid glands reveals another source parathyroid hormone 
parathyroid glands known source circulating parathyroid hormone pth initiates endocrine cascade regulates serum calcium concentration glial cells missing2 gcm2 mouse homologue drosophila gcm transcription factor whose expression restricted parathyroid glands- show gcm2-deficient mice lack parathyroid glands exhibit biological hypoparathyroidism identifying gcm2 master regulatory gene parathyroid gland development unlike pth receptor-deficient mice however gcm2-deficient mice viable fertile mildly abnormal bone phenotype despite lack parathyroid glands gcm2-deficient mice pth serum levels identical wild-type mice parathyroidectomized wild-type animals expression ablation studies identified thymus gcm1 another gcm homologue expressed additional downregulatable source pth thus gcm2 deletion uncovers auxiliary mechanism regulation calcium homeostasis absence parathyroid glands propose backup mechanism may general feature endocrine regulation
