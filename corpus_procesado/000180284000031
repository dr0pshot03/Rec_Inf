nanoparticle assembly transport liquid-liquid interfaces
self-assembly particles fluid interfaces driven reduction interfacial energy well established however nanoscopic particles thermal fluctuations compete interfacial energy give rise particle-size dependent self-assembly ligand-stabilized nanoparticles assembled three-dimensional constructs fluid-fluid interfaces properties unique nanoparticles preserved small size nanoparticles led weak confinement nanoparticles fluid interface opens avenues size-selective particle assembly two-dimensional phase behavior functionalization fluid interfaces afford rapid approach equilibrium easy access nanoparticles subsequent modi cation photoinduced transformation described nanoparticles initially soluble toluene transported across interface water dispersed water phase characteristic fluorescence emission nanoparticles provided direct probe spatial distribution
