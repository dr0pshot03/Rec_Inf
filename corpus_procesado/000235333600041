histone demethylation family jmjc domain-containing proteins 
covalent modification histones important role regulating chromatin dynamics transcription whereas covalent histone modifications reversible recently unknown whether methyl groups actively removed histones using biochemical assay coupled chromatography purified novel jmjc domain-containing protein jhdm1 jmjc domain-containing histone demethylase specifically demethylates histone h3 lysine h3-k36 presence feii alpha-ketoglutarate jhdm1 demethylates h3-methyl-k36 generates formaldehyde succinate overexpression jhdm1 reduced level dimethyl-h3-k36 h3k36me2 vivo demethylase activity jmjc domain-containing proteins conserved jhdm1 homologue saccharomyces cerevisiae also h3-k36 demethylase activity thus identify jmjc domain novel demethylase signature motif uncover protein demethylation mechanism conserved yeast human
