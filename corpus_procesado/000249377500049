fusarium graminearum genome reveals link localized polymorphism pathogen specialization 
sequenced annotated genome filamentous fungus fusarium graminearum major pathogen cultivated cereals repetitive sequences detected process repeat-induced point mutation duplicated sequences subject extensive mutation may partially account reduced repeat content apparent low number paralogous ancestrally duplicated genes second strain f graminearum contained single-nucleotide polymorphisms frequently located near telomeres within discrete chromosomal segments many highly polymorphic regions contained sets genes implicated plant-fungus interactions unusually divergent higher rates recombination regions genome innovation may result selection due interactions f graminearum plant hosts
