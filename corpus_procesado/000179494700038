mechanisms circuitry underlying directional selectivity retina 
retina directionally selective ganglion cells respond robust spiking movement preferred direction show minimal response movement opposite null direction mechanisms circuitry underlying computation remained controversial show isolating excitatory inhibitory inputs directionally selective cells measuring direct connections cells presynaptic neurons presynaptic interneuron starburst amacrine cell delivers direct inhibition directionally selective cells processes starburst cells connected asymmetrically directionally selective cells: pointing null direction deliver inhibition pointing preferred direction starburst cells project inhibition laterally ahead stimulus moving null direction addition starburst inhibition directionally selective: stronger movement null direction excitation response null direction movement reduced inhibitory signal acting site presynaptic directionally selective cell interplay components generates reduced excitation enhanced inhibition null direction thereby ensuring robust directional selectivity
