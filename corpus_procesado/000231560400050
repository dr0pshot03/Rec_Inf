disk dust molecular gas around high-mass protostar 
processes leading birth low-mass stars sun well studied formation high-mass eight times suns mass m- stars remains poorly understood recent studies suggest high-mass stars may form accretion material circumstellar disk essentially way low-mass stars form rather merging several low-mass stars yet however conclusive evidence report presence flattened disk-like structure around massive 15m protostar cepheus region based observations continuum emission dust line emission molecular gas disk radius astronomical units au mass m: oriented perpendicular spatially coincident central embedded powerful bipolar radio jet just case low-mass stars conclude high-mass stars can form accretion
