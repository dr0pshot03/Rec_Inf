microcircuits hierarchical elaboration object coding across primate temporal areas
primates neuronal representations objects processed hierarchically occipitotemporal cortices novel feature objects thought emerge become prevalent cortical area processing area tested possibility feature representation prevalent given area emerges microcircuit hierarchically prior area small number prototypes becomes prevalent subsequent area recorded multiple single units hierarchically sequential areas te macaque temporal cortex found predicted convergent microcircuit object-object association area te associative codes built time microcircuit area results suggest computational principle underlying sequentially elaborated object representations
