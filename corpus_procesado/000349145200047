pervasive degeneracy epistasis protein-protein interface 
mapping protein sequence space difficult problem necessitates analysis 20n combinations sequences length n systematically mapped sequence space four key residues escherichia coli protein kinase phoq drive recognition substrate phop generated library containing variants phoq positions used two-step selection coupled next-generation sequencing identify functional variants results reveal extensive degeneracy phoq-phop interface epistasis effect individual substitutions often highly dependent context together epistasis genetic code create pattern connectivity functional variants sequence space likely constrains phoq evolution consequently diversity phoq orthologs substantially lower functional phoq variants
