atomic homodyne detection continuous-variable entangled twin-atom states
historically completeness quantum theory questioned using concept bipartite continuous-variable entanglement non-classical correlations entanglement two subsystems imply observables one subsystem determined measurement choice regardless distance subsystems nowadays continuous-variable entanglement regarded essential resource allowing quantum enhanced measurement resolution realization quantum teleportation- quantum memories demonstration einstein-podolsky-rosen paradox- applications rely techniques manipulate detect coherences quantum fields quadratures whereas optics coherent homodyne detection quadratures standard technique massive particles corresponding method missing report realization atomic analogue homodyne detection measurement matter-wave quadratures application technique quantum state produced spin-changing collisions bose-einstein condensate reveals continuous-variable entanglement well twin-atom character state results provide rare example continuous-variable entanglement massive particles direct detection atomic quadratures applications experimental quantum atom optics also measurement fields many-body systems massive particles
