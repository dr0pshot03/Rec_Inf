isolation c5-deprotonated imidazolium crystalline "abnormal" n-heterocyclic carbene 
discovery two decades ago metal-free stable carbenes especially imidazol--ylidenes [n-heterocyclic carbenes nhcs] led numerous breakthroughs organic organometallic catalysis recently small range complexes prepared alternative nhc isomers namely imidazol--ylidenes also termed abnormal nhcs anhcs carbene center longer located two nitrogens coordinate transition metal report synthesis metal-free anhc stable room temperature solid state solution calculations show anhc basic normal nhc isomer substituent carbon next carbene center nonbulky phenyl group variety substitution patterns tolerated without precluding isolation corresponding anhc
