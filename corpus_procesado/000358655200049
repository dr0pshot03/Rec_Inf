t-cell exhaustion co-stimulation clinical outcome autoimmunity infection
clinical course autoimmune infectious disease varies greatly even individuals condition understanding molecular basis heterogeneity lead significant improvements monitoring treatment chronic infection process t-cell exhaustion inhibits immune response facilitating viral persistence show transcriptional signature reflecting cd8 t-cell exhaustion associated poor clearance chronic viral infection conversely predicts better prognosis multiple autoimmune diseases development cd8 t-cell exhaustion chronic infection driven persistence antigen lack accessory help signals autoimmunity find evidence cd4 t-cell co-stimulation pronounced cd8 t-cell exhaustion reduced can reproduce exhaustion signature modifying balance persistent stimulation t-cell antigen receptors specific cd2-induced co-stimulation provided human cd8 t cells vitro suggesting process plays role dictating outcome autoimmune disease non-exhausted t-cell state driven cd2-induced co-stimulation reduced signals exhaustion-associated inhibitory receptor pd- suggesting induction exhaustion may therapeutic strategy autoimmune inflammatory disease using expression optimal surrogate markers co-stimulation/exhaustion signatures independent data sets confirm association good clinical outcome response therapy infection hepatitis c virus vaccination yellow fever malaria influenza poor outcome autoimmune inflammatory disease type diabetes anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis systemic lupus erythematosus idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis dengue haemorrhagic fever thus t-cell exhaustion plays central role determining outcome autoimmune disease targeted manipulation process lead new therapeutic opportunities
