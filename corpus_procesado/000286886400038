late holocene methane rise caused orbitally controlled increase tropical sources
considerable debate surrounds source apparently anomalous increase atmospheric methane concentrations since mid-holocene years ago compared previous interglacial periods recorded polar ice core records proposed mechanisms rise methane concentrations relate either methane emissions anthropogenic early rice cultivation increase natural wetland emissions tropical boreal sources show climate wetland simulations global methane cycle last glacial cycle past years recreate ice core record capture late holocene increase methane concentrations analyses indicate late holocene increase results natural changes earths orbital configuration enhanced emissions southern hemisphere tropics linked precession-induced modification seasonal precipitation critically simulations capture declining trend methane concentrations end last interglacial period - years ago used diagnose holocene methane rise unique difference two time periods results differences size rate regional insolation changes lack glacial inception holocene findings also suggest early agricultural sources required account increase methane concentrations years industrial era
