multifunctionality chiton biomineralized armor integrated visual system 
nature provides multitude examples multifunctional structural materials trade-offs imposed conflicting functional requirements one example biomineralized armor chiton acanthopleura granulata incorporates integrated sensory system includes hundreds eyes aragonite-based lenses use optical experiments demonstrate microscopic lenses able form images light scattering polycrystalline lenses minimized use relatively large crystallographically aligned grains multiscale mechanical testing reveals size complexity functionality integrated sensory elements increase local mechanical performance armor decreases however granulata evolved several strategies compensate mechanical vulnerabilities form multipurpose system co-optimized optical structural functions
