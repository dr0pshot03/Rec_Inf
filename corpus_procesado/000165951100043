influence rivers marine boron isotopes implications reconstructing past ocean ph 
ocean ph particularly sensitive atmospheric carbon dioxide content- records ocean ph can therefore used estimate past atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations isotopic composition boron delta b- contained carbonate shells marine organisms varies according ph ocean ph can reconstructed- requires independent estimates delta b dissolved boron sea water time marine delta b budget however still largely unconstrained show incorporating global flux riverine boron estimated delta b measurements worlds main rivers marine boron isotope budget can balanced also derive ocean delta b budgets past myr estimated isotope compositions boron sea water show remarkable consistency records delta b foraminiferal carbonates- suggesting foraminifera delta b records may part reflect changes marine boron isotope budget rather changes ocean ph cenozoic era
