mdc1 mediator mammalian dna damage checkpoint 
counteract continuous exposure cells agents damage dna cells evolved complex regulatory networks called checkpoints sense dna damage coordinate dna replication cell-cycle arrest dna repair recently shown histone h2a variant h2ax specifically controls recruitment dna repair proteins sites dna damage- identify novel brca1 carboxy-terminal brct forkhead-associated fha domain-containing protein mdc1 mediator dna damage checkpoint protein works h2ax promote recruitment repair proteins sites dna breaks addition controls damage-induced cell-cycle arrest checkpoints mdc1 forms foci co-localize extensively gamma-h2ax foci within minutes exposure ionizing radiation h2ax required mdc1 foci formation mdc1 forms complexes phosphorylated h2ax furthermore interaction phosphorylation dependent peptides containing phosphorylated site h2ax bind mdc1 phosphorylation-dependent manner shown using small interfering rna sirna cells lacking mdc1 sensitive ionizing radiation mdc1 controls formation damage-induced 53bp1 brca1 mrn foci part promoting efficient h2ax phosphorylation addition cells lacking mdc1 also fail activate intra-s phase g2/m phase cell-cycle checkpoints properly exposure ionizing radiation associated inability regulate chk1 properly results highlight crucial role mdc1 mediating transduction dna damage signal
