genetic tracing shows segregation taste neuronal circuitries bitter sweet
recent discovery mammalian bitter sweet umami taste receptors indicates different taste qualities encoded periphery however taste representations brain remain elusive used genetic approach visualize neuronal circuitries bitter sweet tastes mice gain insight taste recognition accomplished brain selectively expressing transsynaptic tracer either bitter sweet and/ umami-responsive taste receptor cells comparing locations tracer-labeled neurons brain data revealed potential neuronal bases underlie discrimination bitter versus sweet
