genome sequencing normal cells reveals developmental lineages mutational processes
somatic mutations present genome cell accumulate lifetime multicellular organism mutations can provide insights developmental lineage tree number divisions cell undergone mutational processes operative describe whole genomes clonal lines derived multiple tissues healthy mice using somatic base substitutions reconstructed early cell divisions animal demonstrating contributions embryonic cells adult tissues differences observed tissues numbers types mutations accumulated cell likely reflect differences number cell divisions undergone varying contributions different mutational processes somatic mutation rates similar mice results indicate precise insights development mutagenesis normal human cells will possible
