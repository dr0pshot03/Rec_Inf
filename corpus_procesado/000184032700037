unidirectional rotation mechanically interlocked molecular rotor
molecular motor proteins ubiquitous nature inspired attempts create artificial machines mimic ability produce controlled motion molecular level recent example artificial molecular rotor molecule undergoing unidirectional 120degrees intramolecular rotation around single bond another molecule capable repetitive unimolecular rotation driven multiple successive isomerization central double bond- show sequential unidirectional rotation can also induced mechanically interlocked assemblies comprised one two small rings moving around one larger ring small rings [] [] catenanes move discrete steps different binding sites located larger ring movement driven light heat chemical stimuli change relative affinity small rings different binding sites- find small ring [] catenane moves high positional integrity without control direction motion two rings [] catenane mutually block others movement ensure overall stimuli-induced unidirectional motion around larger ring
