tomographic imaging molecular orbitals 
single-electron wavefunctions orbitals mathematical constructs used describe multi-electron wavefunction molecules highest-lying orbitals responsible chemical properties particular interest observe orbitals change bonds formed broken observe essence chemistry yet single orbitals difficult observe experimentally now impossible timescale chemical reactions demonstrate full three-dimensional structure single orbital can imaged seemingly unlikely technique using high harmonics generated intense femtosecond laser pulses focused aligned molecules applying approach series molecular alignments accomplish tomographic reconstruction highest occupied molecular orbital n- method also allows us follow attosecond dynamics electron wave packet
