pathways neuronal injury apoptosis hiv-associated dementia
human immunodeficiency virus hiv- can induce dementia alarming occurrence worldwide mechanism remains poorly understood discovery brain hiv--binding sites chemokine receptors provides new insights hiv infects macrophages microglia neurons although neurons injured die apoptosis predominant pathway neuronal injury indirect release macrophage microglial astrocyte toxins although direct injury viral proteins might also contribute toxins overstimulate neurons resulting formation free radicals excitotoxicity similar neurodegenerative diseases recent advances understanding signalling pathways mediating events offer hope therapeutic intervention
