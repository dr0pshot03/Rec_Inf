21st-century evolution greenland outlet glacier velocities 
earlier observations several greenlands outlet glaciers starting near turn 21st century indicated rapid annual-scale large >% increases glacier velocity combining data several satellites produce decade-long record documenting ongoing velocity evolution nearly + greenlands major outlet glaciers revealing complex spatial temporal patterns changes fast-flow marine-terminating glaciers contrast steady velocities ice-shelf-terminating glaciers slow speeds land-terminating glaciers regionally glaciers northwest accelerated steadily variability southeast relatively steady flow elsewhere intraregional variability shows complex response regional local forcing observed acceleration indicates sea level rise greenland may fall well proposed upper bounds
