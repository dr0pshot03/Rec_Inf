trb3 links e3 ubiquitin ligase cop1 lipid metabolism
fasting increased concentrations circulating catecholamines promote mobilization lipid stores adipose tissue part phosphorylating inactivating acetyl-coenzyme carboxylase acc rate-limiting enzyme fatty acid synthesis describe parallel pathway pseudokinase tribbles trb3 whose abundance increased fasting stimulates lipolysis triggering degradation acc adipose tissue trb3 promoted acc ubiquitination association e3 ubiquitin ligase constitutive photomorphogenic protein cop1 indeed adipocytes deficient trb3 accumulated larger amounts acc protein wild-type cells transgenic mice expressing trb3 adipose tissue protected diet-induced obesity due enhanced fatty acid oxidation results demonstrate phosphorylation ubiquitination pathways converge key regulator lipid metabolism maintain energy homeostasis
