analysis spatial orientation memory drosophila
flexible goal driven orientation requires position target stored especially case target moves sight capability retain recall integrate positional information guiding behaviour summarized term spatial working memory kind memory contains specific details presence necessarily part long term memory neurophysiological studies primates indicate sustained activity neurons encodes sensory information even though object longer present furthermore suggest dopamine transmits respective input prefrontal cortex simultaneous suppression gaba spatially restricts neuronal activity show drosophila melanogaster possesses similar spatial memory locomotion using new detour setup show flies can remember position object several seconds removed environment setup flies temporarily lured away direction towards hidden target yet thereafter able aim former target furthermore find gabaergic stainable antibodies gaba ring neurons ellipsoid body central brain necessary plasticity sufficient functional spatial orientation memory flies also find protein kinase s6kii ignorant required distinct subset ring neurons display memory conditional expression s6kii neurons adults can restore loss orientation memory ignorant mutant s6kii signalling pathway therefore seems acutely required ring neurons spatial orientation memory flies
