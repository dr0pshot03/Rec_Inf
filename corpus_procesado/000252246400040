dendritic cell-induced memory t cell activation nonlymphoid tissues
secondary lymphoid organs dominant sites t cell activation although many t cells subsequently retained within peripheral tissues currently nonlymphoid compartments viewed sites effector t cell function without involvement renewed induction immunity via interactions professional antigen presenting cells describe method reactivation herpes simplex virus examine stimulation tissue resident t cells secondary challenge results revealed memory cd8+ t cell responses can initiated within peripheral tissues tripartite interaction includes cd4+ t cells recruited dendritic cells findings lend evidence existence sophisticated t cell response mechanism extra lymphoid tissues can act control localized infection
