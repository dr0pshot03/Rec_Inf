hearing visual motion depth
auditory spatial perception strongly affected visual cues example auditory visual stimuli presented synchronously different positions auditory event mislocated towards locus visual stimulus-the ventriloquism effect visual capture also occurs motion perception static auditory stimulus appears move visual moving object investigated human perceptual system coordinates complementary inputs auditory visual senses show auditory aftereffect occurs adaptation visual motion depth minutes viewing square moving depth steady sound perceived changing loudness opposite direction adaptation combination auditory visual stimuli changing compatible direction increased aftereffect effect visual adaptation almost disappeared directions opposite hand listening sound changing intensity affect visual changing-size aftereffect results provide psychophysical evidence processing motion depth auditory system responds auditory changing intensity visual motion depth
