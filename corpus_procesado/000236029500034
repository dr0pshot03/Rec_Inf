probing cellular chemistry biological systems microelectrodes
past years technological impediments fabricating electrodes micrometer dimensions largely overcome small electrodes can readily applied probe chemical events surface tissues individual biological cells can even used monitor concentration changes within intact animals measurements can made rapid time scales minimal perturbation system study several recent applications provided important insights chemical processes cells tissues examples include molecular flux measurements surface single cells skin can offer insights oxidative stress exocytosis drug delivery real-time brain neurotransmitter monitoring living rats reveals correlations behavior molecular events brain findings can promote interdisciplinary collaborations may lead broader understanding chemical aspects biology
