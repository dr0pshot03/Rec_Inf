nanophase transition metal oxides show large thermodynamically driven shifts oxidation-reduction equilibria 
knowing thermodynamic stability transition metal oxide nanoparticles important understanding controlling role variety industrial environmental systems using calorimetric data surface energies cobalt iron manganese nickel oxide systems show surface energy strongly influences redox equilibria phase stability spinels m3o4 commonly lower surface energies metals m rocksalt oxides mo trivalent oxides m2o3 metal; thus contraction stability field divalent oxide expansion spinel field appear general phenomena using tabulated thermodynamic data bulk phases calculate redox phase equilibria nanoscale can lead errors several orders magnitude oxygen fugacity kelvin temperature
