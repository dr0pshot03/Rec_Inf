correlated electrons delta-plutonium within dynamical mean-field picture
given practical importance metallic plutonium considerable interest- understanding fundamental properties plutonium undergoes per cent increase volume transformed alpha phase stable k delta phase stable around k effect crucial issues long-term storage disposal long suspected unique property consequence special location plutonium periodic table border light heavy actinides-here electron wave-particle duality itinerant versus localized behaviour important situation resisted previous theoretical treatment report electronic structure method based dynamical mean-field theory enables interpolation band-like atomic-like behaviour electron approach enables us study phase diagram plutonium providing access energetics one-electron spectra strongly correlated systems explain origin volume expansion alpha delta phases predict existence strong quasiparticle peak near fermi level give new viewpoint physics plutonium alpha delta phases opposite sides interaction-driven localization-delocalization transition
