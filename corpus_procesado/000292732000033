mosaic surface charge contact electrification 
dielectric materials brought contact separated develop static electricity centuries assumed contact charging derives spatially homogeneous material properties along materials surface within given pair materials one charges uniformly positively negatively demonstrate picture contact charging incorrect whereas contact-electrified piece develops net charge either positive negative polarity surface supports random mosaic oppositely charged regions nanoscopic dimensions mosaics surface charge topological characteristics different types electrified dielectrics accommodate significantly charge per unit area previously thought
