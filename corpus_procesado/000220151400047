weak inhibition within visual cortex early life prevents experience-dependent plasticity loss responsiveness eye deprived vision can initiated prematurely enhancing gamma-aminobutyric acid gaba-mediated transmission benzodiazepines use mouse knockin mutation alpha subunits renders individual gaba type agabaa receptors insensitive diazepam show particular inhibitory network controls expression critical period alpha1-containing circuits found drive cortical plasticity whereas alpha2-enriched connections separately regulated neuronal ring dissociation carries implications models brain development safe design benzodiazepines use infants
