rna-directed nuclease mediates post-transcriptional gene silencing drosophila cells
diverse group organisms includes caenorhabditis elegans drosophila planaria hydra trypanosomes fungi plants introduction double-stranded rnas inhibits gene expression sequence-specific manner- responses called rna interference post-transcriptional gene silencing may provide anti-viral defence modulate transposition regulate gene expression- taken biochemical approach towards elucidating mechanisms underlying genetic phenomenon show loss-of-function phenotypes can created cultured drosophila cells transfection specific double-stranded rnas coincides marked reduction level cognate cellular messenger rnas extracts transfected cells contain nuclease activity specifically degrades exogenous transcripts homologous transfected double-stranded rna enzyme contains essential rna component partial purification sequence-specific nuclease co-fractionates discrete similar nucleotide rna species may confer specificity enzyme homology substrate mrnas
