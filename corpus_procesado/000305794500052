uniform ripening encodes golden like transcription factor regulating tomato fruit chloroplast development 
modern tomato solanum lycopersicum varieties bred uniform ripening u light green fruit phenotypes facilitate harvests evenly ripened fruit u encodes golden like glk transcription factor slglk2 determines chlorophyll accumulation distribution developing fruit tomato two glks-slglk1 slglk2-are expressed leaves slglk2 expressed fruit expressing glks increased chlorophyll content fruit whereas slglk2 suppression recapitulated u mutant phenotype glk overexpression enhanced fruit photosynthesis gene expression chloroplast development leading elevated carbohydrates carotenoids ripe fruit slglk2 influences photosynthesis developing fruit contributing mature fruit characteristics suggesting selection u inadvertently compromised ripe fruit quality exchange desirable production traits
