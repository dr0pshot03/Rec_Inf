high-resolution structure prediction crystallographic phase problem
energy-based refinement low-resolution protein structure models atomic-level accuracy major challenge computational structural biology describe new approach refining protein structure models focuses sampling regions likely contain errors allowing whole structure relax physically realistic all-atom force field applications models produced using nuclear magnetic resonance data comparative models based distant structural homologues method can significantly improve accuracy structures terms backbone conformations placement core side chains furthermore resulting models satisfy particularly stringent test: provide significantly better solutions x-ray crystallographic phase problem molecular replacement trials finally show all-atom refinement can produce de novo protein structure predictions reach high accuracy required molecular replacement without experimental phase information absence templates suitable molecular replacement protein data bank results suggest combination high-resolution structure prediction state-of-the-art phasing tools may unexpectedly powerful phasing crystallographic data molecular replacement hindered absence sufficiently accurate previous models
