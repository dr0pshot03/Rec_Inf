expressing human genome 
searched human genome genes encoding new proteins may involved three nuclear gene expression processes: transcription pre-messenger rna splicing polyadenylation plethora potential new factors implicated sequence nuclear gene expression revealing substantial selective increase complexity compared drosophila melanogaster caenorhabditis elegans although raw genomic information limitations availability offers new experimental approaches studying gene expression
