evolutionary fate consequences duplicate genes
gene duplication generally viewed necessary source material origin evolutionary novelties unclear often gene duplicates arise frequently evolve new functions observations genomic databases several eukaryotic species suggest duplicate genes arise high rate average per gene per million years duplicated genes experience brief period relaxed selection early history moderate fraction evolving effectively neutral manner period however vast majority gene duplicates silenced within million years survivors subsequently experiencing strong purifying selection although duplicate genes may rarely evolve new functions stochastic silencing genes may play significant role passive origin new species
