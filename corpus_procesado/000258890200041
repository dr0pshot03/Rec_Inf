nanoscale double emulsions stabilized single-component block copolypeptides 
water oil water emulsions examples double emulsions dispersions small water droplets within larger oil droplets dispersed continuous aqueous phase- emulsions occur many forms processing used extensively foods cosmetics coatings industries compartmentalized internal structure double emulsions can provide advantages simple oil water emulsions encapsulation ability carry polar non polar cargos improved control release therapeutic molecules- preparation double emulsions typically requires mixtures surfactants stability formation double nanoemulsions inner outer droplets nm yet achieved- show water oil water double emulsions can prepared simple process stabilized many months using single component synthetic amphiphilic diblock copolypeptide surfactants surfactants even stabilize droplets subjected extreme flow leading direct mass production robust double nanoemulsions amenable nanostructured encapsulation applications foods cosmetics drug delivery
