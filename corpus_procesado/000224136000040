phytochrome-interacting factor critical bhlh regulator chlorophyll biosynthesis
photosynthetic organisms must achieve delicate balance light energy absorbed chlorophyll capacity channel energy productive photochemical reactions release excess absorbed energy cell can cause lethal photooxidative damage identified basic helix-toop-helix bhlh transcription factor designated phytochrome-interacting factor pif1 negatively regulates chlorophyll biosynthesis pif1 mutant seedlings accumulate excess free protochlorophyllide grown dark consequent lethal bleaching upon exposure light pif1 interacts specifically photoactivated conformer phytochromes b suggesting signaling pathway chlorophyll biosynthetic rates tightly controlled critical initial emergence seedlings subterranean darkness sunlight
