ecosystem stability compensatory effects inner mongolia grassland
numerous studies suggested biodiversity reduces variability ecosystem productivity compensatory effects- species increases abundance response reduction another fluctuating environment view challenged several grounds- studies based artificially constructed grasslands short duration long-term studies natural ecosystems needed basis year study inner mongolia grassland present three key findings first january-july precipitation primary climatic factor causing fluctuations community biomass production second ecosystem stability conversely related variability community biomass production increases progressively along hierarchy organizational levels species functional group whole community finally community-level stability seems arise compensatory interactions among major components species functional group levels hierarchical perspective results corroborate previous findings compensatory effects undisturbed mature steppe ecosystems seem culminate high biodiversity productivity ecosystem stability concurrently relationships correlational studies necessary verify causation among factors study provides new insights better management restoration rapidly degrading inner mongolia grassland
