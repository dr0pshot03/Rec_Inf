real-time detection electron tunnelling quantum dot 
nanostructures strong coulomb interactions exist electrons predicted exhibit temporal electronic correlations although ample experimental evidence correlations exist electron dynamics engineered nanostructures observed directly long timescales faster dynamics associated electrical currents charge fluctuations usually inferred direct quasi-direct current measurements recently interest electron dynamics risen part owing realization additional information electronic interactions can found shot noise higher statistical moments direct current furthermore interest quantum computation stimulated investigation quantum bit qubit readout techniques many condensed-matter systems ultimately reduce single-shot measurements individual electronic charges report real-time observation individual electron tunnelling events quantum dot using integrated radio-frequency single-electron transistor use electron counting measure directly quantum dots tunnelling rate occupational probabilities charge state results provide evidence favour long mus inelastic scattering times nearly isolated dots
