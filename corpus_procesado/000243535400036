divalent metal nanoparticles 
nanoparticles can used building blocks materials supracrystals ionic liquids however lack ability bond along specific directions atoms molecules report simple method place target molecules specifically two diametrically opposed positions molecular coating metal nanoparticles approach based functionalization polar singularities must form curved surface coated ordered monolayers phase-separated mixture ligands molecules placed polar defects used chemical handles form nanoparticle chains turn can generate self-standing films
