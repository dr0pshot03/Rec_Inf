genomic variation landscape human gut microbiome
whereas large-scale efforts rapidly advanced understanding practical impact human genomic variation practical impact variation largely unexplored human microbiome therefore developed framework metagenomic variation analysis applied faecal metagenomes individuals europe north america using billion reads aligned reference species detected million single nucleotide polymorphisms snps short insertions/deletions structural variants average ratio non-synonymous synonymous polymorphism rates variable gut microbial species across human hosts subjects sampled varying time intervals exhibited individuality temporal stability snp variation patterns despite considerable composition changes gut microbiota indicates individual-specific strains easily replaced individual might unique metagenomic genotype may exploitable personalized diet drug intake
