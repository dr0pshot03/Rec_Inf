single-atom single-photon quantum interface
major challenge scalable quantum computing architecture faithful transfer information one node another report realization atom-photon quantum interface based optical cavity using entangle single atom single photon map quantum state atom onto second single photon latter step disentangles atom light produces entangled photon pair scheme intrinsically deterministic establishes basic element required realize distributed quantum network individual atoms rest quantum memories single flying photons quantum messengers
