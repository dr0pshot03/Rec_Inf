geometric frustration compositionally modulated ferroelectrics 
geometric frustration broad phenomenon results intrinsic incompatibility fundamental interactions underlying lattice geometry- geometric frustration gives rise new fundamental phenomena known yield intriguing effects formation exotic states like spin ice spin liquids spin glasses- also led interesting findings fractional charge quantization magnetic monopoles mechanisms related geometric frustration proposed understand origins relaxor multiferroic behaviour colossal magneto-capacitive coupling unusual novel mechanisms high-transition-temperature superconductivity- although geometric frustration particularly well studied magnetic systems past years manifestation important class formed ferroelectric materials compounds electric rather magnetic dipoles basically unknown show using technique based first principles compositionally graded ferroelectrics possess characteristic fingerprints associated geometric frustration systems highly degenerate energy surface display critical phenomena reveal exotic orderings novel stripe phases involving complex spatial organization stripes display spiral states topological defects curvature compositionally graded ferroelectrics can thus considered missing link brings ferroelectrics broad category materials able exhibit geometric frustration ab initio calculations allow deep microscopic insight novel geometrically frustrated system
