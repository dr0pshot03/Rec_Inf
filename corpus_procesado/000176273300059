heat-sensitive trp channel expressed keratinocytes 
mechanical thermal cues stimulate specialized group sensory neurons terminate skin three members transient receptor potential trp family channels expressed subsets neurons activated distinct physiological temperatures describe cloning characterization novel thermosensitive trp channel trpv3 unique threshold: activated innocuous warm temperatures shows increased response noxious temperatures trpv3 specifically expressed keratinocytes; hence skin cells capable detecting heat via molecules similar heat-sensing neurons
