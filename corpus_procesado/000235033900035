low density g cm- trojan binary asteroid patroclus 
trojan population consists two swarms asteroids following orbit jupiter located l4 l5 stable lagrange points jupiter sun system leading following jupiter degrees asteroid patroclus known binary trojan orbit double system hitherto unknown report components separated km move around systems centre mass describing roughly circular orbit using orbital information combined thermal measurements estimate size components derive low density -+ g cm- components patroclus therefore porous composed mostly water ice suggesting formed outer part solar system
