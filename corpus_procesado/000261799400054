crispr interference limits horizontal gene transfer staphylococci targeting dna
horizontal gene transfer hgt bacteria archaea occurs phage transduction transformation conjugation latter particularly important spread antibiotic resistance clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat crispr loci confer sequence directed immunity phages clinical isolate staphylococcus epidermidis harbors crispr spacer matches nickase gene present nearly staphylococcal conjugative plasmids show crispr interference prevents conjugation plasmid transformation s epidermidis insertion self splicing intron nickase blocks interference despite reconstitution target sequence spliced mrna indicates interference machinery targets dna directly conclude crispr loci counteract multiple routes hgt can limit spread antibiotic resistance pathogenic bacteria
