secondary transporters workhorses cellular membranes catalyzing movement small molecules ions across bilayer coupling substrate passage ion gradients however conformational changes accompany substrate transport mechanism substrate moves transporter principles competitive inhibition remain unclear used crystallographic functional studies leucine transporter leut model neurotransmitter sodium symporters show various amino acid substrates induce occluded conformational state competitive inhibitor tryptophan trp traps leut open conformation trp complex extracellular gate residues arginine aspartic acid define second weak binding site substrates inhibitors permeate extracellular solution primary substrate site demonstrates residues participate gating also mediate permeation
