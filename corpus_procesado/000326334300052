mosaic copy number variation human neurons
used single-cell genomic approaches map dna copy number variation cnv neurons obtained human induced pluripotent stem cell hipsc lines postmortem human brains identified aneuploid neurons well numerous subchromosomal cnvs euploid neurons neurotypic hipsc-derived neurons larger cnvs fibroblasts several large deletions found hipsc-derived neurons matched neural progenitor cells single-cell sequencing endogenous human frontal cortex neurons revealed % neurons least one megabase-scale de novo cnv deletions twice common duplications subset neurons highly aberrant genomes marked multiple alterations results show mosaic cnv abundant human neurons
