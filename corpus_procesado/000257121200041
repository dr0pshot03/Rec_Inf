virus attenuation genome-scale changes codon pair bias 
result redundancy genetic code adjacent pairs amino acids can encoded many different pairs synonymous codons species specific codon pair bias provides synonymous codon pairs used less frequently statistically predicted synthesized de novo large dna molecules using hundreds underrepresented synonymous codon pairs encode poliovirus capsid protein underrepresented codon pairs caused decreased rates protein translation polioviruses containing amino acid independent changes attenuated mice polioviruses thus customized used immunize mice provided protective immunity challenge death thousand cuts strategy generally applicable attenuating many kinds viruses
