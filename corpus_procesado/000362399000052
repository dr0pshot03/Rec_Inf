crystal structure human glycine receptor-alpha bound antagonist strychnine 
neurotransmitter-gated ion channels cys-loop receptor family essential mediators fast neurotransmission throughout nervous system implicated many neurological disorders available x-ray structures prokaryotic eukaryotic cys-loop receptors provide tremendous insights binding agonists subsequent opening ion channel mechanism channel activation- yet mechanism inactivation antagonists remains unknown present angstrom x-ray structure human glycine receptor-alpha homopentamer complex high affinity high-specificity antagonist strychnine structure allows us explore detail molecular recognition antagonists comparisons previous structures reveal mechanism antagonist-induced inactivation cys-loop receptors involving expansion orthosteric binding site extracellular domain coupled closure ion pore transmembrane domain
