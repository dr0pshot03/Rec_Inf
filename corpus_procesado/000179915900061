coordinated nonvectorial folding newly synthesized multidomain protein 
low-density lipoprotein receptor ldl-r typical example multidomain protein vivo folding assumed occur vectorially amino terminus carboxyl terminus using pulse-chase approach intact cells found instead newly synthesized ldl-r molecules folded way collapsed intermediates contained non-native disulfide bonds distant cysteines amino-terminal domain acquired native conformation late folding instead synthesis thus productive ldl-r folding cell vectorial mostly posttranslational involves transient long-range non-native disulfide bonds isomerized native short-range cysteine pairs
