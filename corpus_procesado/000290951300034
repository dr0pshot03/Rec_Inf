probing cellular protein complexes using single-molecule pull-down
proteins perform cellular functions macromolecular complexes protein often participates different complexes exhibit diverse functionality current ensemble approaches identifying cellular protein interactions reveal physiological permutations interactions describe single-molecule pull-down simpull assay combines principles conventional pull-down assay single-molecule fluorescence microscopy enables direct visualization individual cellular protein complexes simpull can reveal many proteins kinds present vivo complex show using protein kinase demonstrate wide applicability various signalling proteins found cytosol membrane cellular organelles endogenous protein complexes animal tissue extracts pulled-down proteins functional used without processing single-molecule biochemical studies simpull provide rapid sensitive robust platform analysing protein assemblies biological pathways
