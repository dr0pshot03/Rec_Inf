feedback regulation transcriptional termination mammalian circadian clock period complex
eukaryotic circadian clocks built transcriptional feedback loops mammals period per cryptochrome cry proteins accumulate form large nuclear complex per complex repress transcription found mouse per complexes included rna helicases ddx5 dhx9 active rna polymerase ii large subunit per cry pre-mrnas setx helicase promotes transcriptional termination circadian negative feedback rna polymerase ii accumulated near termination sites per cry genes control genes recruitment per complexes elongating polymerase per cry termination sites inhibited setx action impeding rna polymerase ii release thereby repressing transcriptional reinitiation circadian clock negative feedback thus includes direct control transcriptional termination
