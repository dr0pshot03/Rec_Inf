structural basis modulation g-protein-coupled receptor allosteric drugs
design g-protein-coupled receptor gpcr allosteric modulators active area modern pharmaceutical research proved challenging neither binding modes molecular mechanisms drugs known determine binding sites bound conformations specific drug-receptor interactions several allosteric modulators m2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor m2 receptor prototypical family gpcr using atomic-level simulations modulators spontaneously associate receptor despite substantial structural diversity modulators form cation-p interactions clusters aromatic residues receptor extracellular vestibule approximately angstrom classical orthosteric ligand-binding site validate observed modulator binding modes radioligand binding experiments receptor mutants designed basis simulations either increase decrease modulator affinity simulations also revealed mechanisms contribute positive negative allosteric modulation classical ligand binding including coupled conformational changes two binding sites electrostatic interactions ligands sites observations enabled design chemical modifications substantially alter modulators allosteric effects findings thus provide structural basis rational design allosteric modulators targeting muscarinic possibly gpcrs
