trienoic fatty acids plant tolerance high temperature 
chloroplast membrane higher plants contains unusually high concentration trienoic fatty acids plants grown colder temperatures higher content trienoic fatty acids transgenic tobacco plants gene encoding chloroplast omega fatty acid desaturase synthesizes trienoic fatty acids silenced contained lower level trienoic fatty acids wild-type plants better able acclimate higher temperatures
