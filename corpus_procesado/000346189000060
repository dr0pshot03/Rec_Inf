chromatin decondensation sufficient alter nuclear organization embryonic stem cells
differentiation thousands genes repositioned toward away nuclear envelope movements correlate changes transcription replication timing using synthetic tale transcription factors found transcriptional activation endogenous genes viral trans-activator sufficient induce gene repositioning toward nuclear interior embryonic stem cells however gene relocation also induced recruitment acidic peptide decondenses chromatin without affecting transcription indicating nuclear reorganization driven chromatin remodeling rather transcription identified epigenetic inheritance chromatin decondensation maintained central nuclear positioning mitosis even tale transcription factor lost results also demonstrate transcriptional activation chromatin decondensation sufficient change replication timing
