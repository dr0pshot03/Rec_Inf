fermionic bell-state analyzer spin qubits 
propose protocol physical implementation partial bell-state measurements fermionic qubits allowing deterministic quantum computing solid-state systems without need two-qubit gates scheme consists two spin qubits double quantum dot two dots different zeeman splittings resonant tunneling dots allowed spins antiparallel converts spin parity charge information means projective measurement can implemented established technologies measurement-based qubit scheme greatly simplifies experimental realization scalable quantum computers electronic nanostructures
