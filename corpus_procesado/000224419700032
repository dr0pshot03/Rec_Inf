structure catalytically active gold titania
high catalytic activity gold clusters oxides attributed structural effects including particle thickness shape metal oxidation state well support effects created well-ordered gold monolayers bilayers completely wet cover oxide support thus eliminating particle shape direct support effects high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy carbon monoxide adsorption confirm gold atoms bonded titanium atoms kinetic measurements catalytic oxidation carbon monoxide show gold bilayer structure significantly active order magnitude monolayer
