deciphering splicing code 
alternative splicing crucial role generation biological complexity misregulation often involved human disease describe assembly splicing code uses combinations hundreds rna features predict tissue-dependent changes alternative splicing thousands exons code determines new classes splicing patterns identifies distinct regulatory programs different tissues identifies mutation-verified regulatory sequences widespread regulatory strategies revealed including use unexpectedly large combinations features establishment low exon inclusion levels overcome features specific tissues appearance features deeper introns previously appreciated modulation splice variant levels transcript structure characteristics code detected class exons whose inclusion silences expression adult tissues activating nonsense-mediated messenger rna decay whose exclusion promotes expression embryogenesis code facilitates discovery detailed characterization regulated alternative splicing events genome-wide scale
