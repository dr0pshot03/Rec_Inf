serial femtosecond crystallography g protein-coupled receptors 
x-ray crystallography g protein-coupled receptors membrane proteins hampered difficulties associated growing sufficiently large crystals withstand radiation damage yield high-resolution data synchrotron sources used x-ray free-electron laser xfel individual -femtosecond-duration x-ray pulses minimize radiation damage obtained high-resolution room-temperature structure human serotonin receptor using sub--micrometer microcrystals grown membrane mimetic matrix known lipidic cubic phase compared structure solved using traditional microcrystallography cryo-cooled crystals two orders magnitude larger volume room-temperature xfel structure displays distinct distribution thermal motions conformations residues likely accurately represent receptor structure dynamics cellular environment
