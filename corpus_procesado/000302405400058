interleukin- drives endogenous thymic regeneration mice 
endogenous thymic regeneration crucial function allows renewal immune competence stress infection immunodepletion however mechanisms governing regeneration remain poorly understood detail mechanism centered interleukin- il- triggered depletion cd4+cd8+ double-positive thymocytes intrathymic levels il- increased thymic insult thymic recovery impaired il--deficient mice il- signaled thymic epithelial cells promoted proliferation survival up-regulated radio-resistant ror gammat+ccr6+nkp46- lymphoid tissue inducer cells thymic injury il--dependent manner administration il- enhanced thymic recovery total body irradiation studies reveal mechanisms endogenous thymic repair offer innovative regenerative strategies improving immune competence
