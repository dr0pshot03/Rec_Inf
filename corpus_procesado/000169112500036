fabry-perot interference nanotube electron waveguide 
behaviour traditional electronic devices can understood terms classical diffusive motion electrons size device becomes comparable electron coherence length however quantum interference electron waves becomes increasingly important leading dramatic changes device properties- classical-to-quantum transition device behaviour suggests possibility nanometer-sized electronic elements make use quantum coherence molecular electronic devices promising candidates realizing device elements electronic motion molecules inherently quantum mechanical can modified well defined chemistry- describe example coherent molecular electronic device whose behaviour explicitly dependent quantum interference propagating electron waves-a fabry-perot electron resonator based individual single-walled carbon nanotubes near-perfect ohmic contacts electrodes devices nanotubes act coherent electron waveguides- resonant cavity formed two nanotube-electrode interfaces use theoretical model based multichannel landauer-buttiker formalism- analyse device characteristics rnd coupling two propagating modes nanotubes caused electron scattering nanotube-electrode interfaces important
