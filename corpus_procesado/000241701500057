surface expression mhc class ii dendritic cells controlled regulated ubiquitination
dendritic cells unique function immune response owing ability stimulate immunologically naive t lymphocytes response microbial inflammatory stimuli dendritic cells enhance capacity antigen presentation process terminal differentiation termed maturation conversion immature mature dendritic cells accompanied marked cellular reorganization including redistribution major histocompatibility complex class ii molecules mhc ii late endosomal lysosomal compartments plasma membrane- downregulation forms endocytosis thought slow clearance mhc ii surface- relative extent mechanisms contribute regulation surface mhc ii remains unclear however find mhc ii beta-chain cytoplasmic tail ubiquitinated mouse immature dendritic cells although partly required sequestration mhc ii multivesicular bodies modification essential endocytosis notably ubiquitination mhc ii ceased upon maturation resulting accumulation mhc ii cell surface dendritic cells thus exhibit unique ability regulate mhc ii surface expression selectively controlling mhc ii ubiquitination
