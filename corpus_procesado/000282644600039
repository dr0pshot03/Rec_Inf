dynamics onset frictional slip
way frictional interface fails critical fundamental understanding failure processes fields ranging engineering study earthquakes frictional motion initiated rupture fronts propagate within thin interface separates two sheared bodies measuring shear normal stresses along interface together subsequent rapid real-contact-area dynamics find ratio shear stress normal stress can locally far exceed static-friction coefficient without precipitating slip moreover different modes rupture selected system correspond distinct regimes local stress ratio results indicate key role nonuniformity frictional stability dynamics implications prediction selection arrest different modes earthquakes
