cd4+ t-cell help controls cd8+ t-cell memory via trail-mediated activation-induced cell death
help provided cd4+ t lymphocytes priming cd8+ t lymphocytes confers key feature immune memory: capacity autonomous secondary expansion following re-encounter antigen- primed presence cd4+ t cells helped cd8+ t cells acquire ability undergo second round clonal expansion upon restimulation absence t-cell help helpless cd8+ t cells primed absence cd4+ t cells contrast can mediate effector functions cytotoxicity cytokine secretion upon restimulation undergo second round clonal expansion disparate responses features programmed guided signals transmitted naive cd8+ t cells priming encode specific fates clonal progeny explore instructional programme governs secondary response cd8+ t cells find helpless cells undergo death activation-induced cell death upon secondary stimulation death mediated tumour-necrosis factor tnf related apoptosis-inducing ligand trail regulation trail expression can therefore account role cd4+ t cells generation cd8+ t cell memory represents novel mechanism controlling adaptive immune responses
