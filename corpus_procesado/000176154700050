regulation arabidopsis cryptochrome blue-light-dependent phosphorylation 
cryptochromes blue/ultraviolet-a light receptors mediate various light responses plants animals initial photochemical reaction cryptochrome still unclear example although photoreceptors known undergo light-dependent protein modification phosphorylation blue-light dependent phosphorylation reported cryptochrome arabidopsis cryptochrome cry2 mediates light regulation seedling development photoperiodic flowering physiological activity cellular level cry2 protein light-dependent- protein-protein interactions important cry2 function report cry2 undergoes blue-light-dependent phosphorylation cry2 phosphorylation associated function regulation results suggest absence light cry2 remains unphosphorylated inactive stable absorption blue light induces phosphorylation cry2 triggering photomorphogenic responses eventually degradation photoreceptor
