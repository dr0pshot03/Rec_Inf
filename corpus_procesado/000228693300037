repeated injections energy first 600ms giant flare sgr
massive flare december soft gamma-ray repeater sgr possible magnetar- saturated almost gamma-ray detectors- meaning profile pulse poorly characterized accurate profile essential determine physically happening source report unsaturated gamma-ray profile first ms flare time resolution ms peak profile order photons cm- s- reached similar ms onset flare followed gradual decrease superposed oscillatory modulations possibly representing repeated energy injections similar ms intervals implied total energy comparable stored magnetic energy magnetar similar erg based dipole magnetic field intensity similar g suggesting either energy release mechanism extremely efficient interior magnetic field much stronger external dipole field
