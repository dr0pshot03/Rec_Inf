single-stranded architecture cotranscriptional folding rna nanostructures
artificial dna rna structures used scaffolds variety nanoscale devices comparison dna structures rna structures limited size also advantages: rna can fold transcription thus can genetically encoded expressed cells introduce architecture designing artificial rna structures fold single strand arrays antiparallel rna helices precisely organized rna tertiary motifs new type crossover pattern constructed rna tiles assemble hexagonal lattices demonstrated lattices can made annealing and/or cotranscriptional folding tiles can scaled nucleotides length reaching size comparable large natural ribozymes
