editing-defective trna synthetase causes protein misfolding neurodegeneration 
misfolded proteins associated several pathological conditions including neurodegeneration although abnormally folded proteins result mutations genes encoding disease-associated proteins example repeat-expansion diseases general mechanisms lead misfolded proteins neurons remain largely unknown demonstrate low levels mischarged transfer rnas trnas can lead intracellular accumulation misfolded proteins neurons accumulations accompanied upregulation cytoplasmic protein chaperones induction unfolded protein response report mouse sticky mutation causes cerebellar purkinje cell loss ataxia missense mutation editing domain alanyl-trna synthetase gene compromises proofreading activity enzyme aminoacylation trnas findings demonstrate disruption translational fidelity terminally differentiated neurons leads accumulation misfolded proteins cell death provide novel mechanism underlying neurodegeneration
