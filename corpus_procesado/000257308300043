light carbon reservoir recorded zircon-hosted diamond jack hills 
recent discovery diamond graphite inclusions earths oldest zircon grains formed myr ago jack hills metasediments western australia provides unique opportunity investigate earths earliest known carbon reservoir report ion microprobe analyses carbon isotope composition diamond graphite inclusions observed delta cpdb values expressed using peedee belemnite standard range per mil per mil median per mil extends beyond typical mantle values around per mil values observed metamorphic eclogitic diamonds interpreted reflect deep subduction low-delta cpdb biogenic surface carbon low delta cpdb values may also produced inorganic chemical reactions therefore unambiguous evidence life earth early myr ago regardless results suggest low-delta cpdb reservoir may existed early earth
