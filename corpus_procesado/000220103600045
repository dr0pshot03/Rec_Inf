unified spatial scaling species trophic interactions
two largely independent bodies scaling theory address quantitative relationships habitat area species diversity trophic interactions spatial theory within macroecology addresses species richness scales area landscapes typically ignoring interspecific interactions- complexity theory within community ecology addresses trophic links scale species richness food webs typically ignoring spatial considerations- recent studies suggest unifying theories demonstrating spatial patterns influence food-web structure- vice versa follow suggestion developing empirically testing unified scaling theory basis power-law species-area relationships develop link-area non-power-law link-species models accurately predict trophic links scale area species richness microcosms lakes streams community metacommunity levels contrast previous models assume species richness alone determines number trophic links models include species spatial distribution hence extend domain complexity theory metacommunity scales generality predictive success shows complexity theory spatial theory can unified much general theory addressing new domains ecology
