modulation hiv replication rna interference
rna interference rnai process double-stranded rna dsrna directs sequence-specific degradation messenger rna animal plant cells mammalian cells rnai can triggered nucleotide duplexes small interfering rna sirna describe inhibition early late steps hiv replication human cell lines primary lymphocytes sirnas targeted various regions hiv genome demonstrate synthetic sirna duplexes plasmid-derived sirnas inhibit hiv infection specifically degrading genomic hiv rna thereby preventing formation viral complementary-dna intermediates results demonstrate utility rnai modulating hiv replication cycle provide evidence genomic hiv rna exists within nucleoprotein reverse-transcription complex amenable sirna-mediated degradation
