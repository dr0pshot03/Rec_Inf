cohesins form chromosomal cis-interactions developmentally regulated ifng locus
cohesin-mediated sister chromatid cohesion essential chromosome segregation post-replicative dna repair addition evidence model organisms- human genetics suggests cohesin involved control gene expression non-canonical role recently rationalized findings mammalian cohesin complexes recruited subset dnase hypersensitive sites conserved noncoding sequences dna-binding protein ctcf- ctcf functions insulators control interactions enhancers promoters boundary elements demarcate regions distinct chromatin structure cohesin contributes enhancer-blocking activity underlying mechanisms remain unknown full spectrum cohesin functions remains determined show cohesin forms topological mechanistic basis cell-type-specific long-range chromosomal interactions cis developmentally regulated cytokine locus ifng hence ability cohesin constrain chromosome topology used purpose sister chromatid cohesion also dynamically define spatial conformation specific loci new aspect cohesin function probably important normal development- disease
