adherens junctions inhibit asymmetric division drosophila epithelium 
asymmetric division fundamental mechanism generating cellular diversity central nervous system drosophila neural progenitor cells called neuroblasts undergo asymmetric division along apical-basal cellular axis neuroblasts originate neuroepithelial cells polarized along apical-basal axis divide symmetrically along planar axis asymmetry neuroblasts might arise neuroblast-specific expression proteins required asymmetric division alternatively neuroblasts neuroepithelial cells capable dividing asymmetrically neuroepithelial cells polarity cues might prevent asymmetric division show disrupting adherens junctions can convert symmetric epithelial division asymmetric division confirm adenomatous polyposis coli apc tumour suppressor protein recruited adherens junctions demonstrate apc microtubule-associated eb1 homologues- required symmetric epithelial division along planar axis results indicate neuroepithelial cells necessary components execute asymmetric division pathway normally overridden planar polarity cue provided adherens junctions
