atomic-level models bacterial carboxysome shell 
carboxysome bacterial microcompartment functions simple organelle sequestering enzymes involved carbon fixation carboxysome shell roughly angstroms diameter assembled several thousand protein subunits previous studies revealed three dimensional structures hexameric carboxysome shell proteins self assemble molecular layers likely constitute facets polyhedral shell report three dimensional structures two proteins previously unknown function ccml orfa csos4a two known classes carboxysomes resolutions angstroms proteins assemble form pentameric structures whose size shape compatible formation vertices icosahedral shell combining pentamers hexamers previously elucidated gives two plausible preliminary atomic models carboxysome shell
