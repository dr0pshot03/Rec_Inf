state-specific correlation coincident product pairs f+cd4 reaction 
chemical reaction forms two molecular products even state-resolved differential cross section dcs product obtained individually coincident attributes coproducts still lacking exploit method provides coincidence information measuring state-resolved pair-correlated dcs exemplified reaction f + cd4-->df + cd3 time-sliced ion velocity imaging technique used measure velocity distribution state-selected cd3 product reveal information coincident df state-correlated manner correlation different product state pairs shows striking difference opens new way unravel complexity polyatomic reaction
