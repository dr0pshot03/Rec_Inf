activation aldehyde dehydrogenase reduces ischemic damage heart 
substantial interest development drugs limit extent ischemia induced cardiac damage caused myocardial infarction certain surgical procedures using unbiased proteomic search identified mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase aldh2 enzyme whose activation correlates reduced ischemic heart damage rodent models high throughput screen yielded small molecule activator aldh2 alda administered rats ischemic event reduced infarct size % likely inhibitory effect formation cytotoxic aldehydes vitro alda particularly effective activator aldh2* inactive mutant form enzyme found % east asian populations thus pharmacologic enhancement aldh2 activity may useful patients wild type mutant aldh2 subjected cardiac ischemia coronary bypass surgery
