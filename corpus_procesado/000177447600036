proterozoic ocean chemistry evolution: bioinorganic bridge 
recent data imply much proterozoic eon million years ago earths oceans moderately oxic surface sulfidic depth conditions biologically important trace metals scarce marine environments potentially restricting nitrogen cycle affecting primary productivity limiting ecological distribution eukaryotic algae oceanic redox conditions bioinorganic consequences may thus help explain observed patterns proterozoic evolution
