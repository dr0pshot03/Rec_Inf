staphylococcus aureus nonribosomal peptide secondary metabolites regulate virulence
staphylococcus aureus major human pathogen resistant numerous antibiotics clinical use found two nonribosomal peptide secondary metabolites-the aureusimines made s aureus-that antibiotics function regulators virulence factor expression necessary productive infections vivo mouse models bacteremia showed strains s aureus unable produce aureusimines attenuated and/or cleared major organs including spleen liver heart targeting aureusimine synthesis may offer novel leads anti-infective drugs
