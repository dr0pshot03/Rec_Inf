structural signature jamming granular media
glasses rigid flow temperature increased similarly granular materials rigid become unjammed flow sufficient shear stress applied rigid flowing phases strikingly different yet measurements reveal structures glass liquid virtually indistinguishable therefore natural ask whether structural signature jammed granular state distinguishes flowing counterpart find evidence signature measuring contact-force distribution particles shearing forces sensitive minute variations particle position distribution forces can serve microscope observe correlations positions nearest neighbours find qualitative change force distribution onset jamming proposed- jamming glass transitions related observation structural signature associated jamming hints existence similar structural difference glass transition presumably subtle conventional scattering techniques uncover measurements also provide determination granular temperature counterpart granular systems glass-transition temperature liquids
