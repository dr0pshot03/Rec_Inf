recent segmental duplications human genome 
primate-specific segmental duplications considered important human disease evolution inability distinguish allelic duplication sequence overlap hampered characterization well assembly annotation genome developed method whereby public sequence analyzed clone level overrepresentation within whole-genome shotgun sequence test ability detect duplications larger kilobases irrespective copy number location high sequence similarity mapped large regions flanked highly similar duplications twenty-four hot spots genomic instability associated genetic disease analysis indicates highly nonrandom chromosomal genic distribution recent segmental duplications likely role expanding protein diversity
