tuning clathrate hydrates hydrogen storage 
storage large quantities hydrogen safe pressures key factor establishing hydrogen-based economy previous strategies-where hydrogen bound chemically adsorbed materials permanent void space stored hybrid materials combine elements-have problems arising either technical considerations materials cost- recently reported- clathrate hydrate hydrogen exhibiting two different-sized cages seem meet necessary storage requirements however extreme pressures similar kbar required produce material make impractical synthesis pressure can decreased filling larger cavity tetrahydrofuran thf stabilize material potential storage capacity material compromised approach report hydrogen storage capacities thf-containing binary-clathrate hydrates can increased similar 4wt% modest pressures tuning composition allow hydrogen guests enter larger smaller cages retaining low-pressure stability tuning mechanism quite general convenient using water-soluble hydrate promoters various small gaseous guests
