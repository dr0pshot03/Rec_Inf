experimental entanglement purification arbitrary unknown states 
distribution entangled states distant locations essential quantum communication- large distances owing unavoidable decoherence quantum communication channel quality entangled states generally decreases exponentially channel length entanglement purification way extract subset states high entanglement high purity large set less entangled states thus needed overcome decoherence besides important application quantum communication entanglement purification also plays crucial role error correction quantum computation can significantly increase quality logic operations different qubits demonstrate entanglement purification general mixed states polarization-entangled photons using linear optics typically one photon pair fidelity % obtained two pairs fidelity % experiments decoherence overcome extent technique achieve tolerable error rates quantum repeaters long-distance quantum communication results also imply requirement high-accuracy logic operations fault-tolerant quantum computation can considerably relaxed
