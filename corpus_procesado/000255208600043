upper intestinal lipids trigger gut-brain-liver axis regulate glucose production
energy glucose homeostasis regulated food intake liver glucose production respectively upper intestine critical role nutrient digestion absorption however studies indicate upper intestinal lipids inhibit food intake well rodents humans activation intestine brain axis- parallel brain liver axis recently proposed detect blood lipids inhibit glucose production rodents thus tested hypothesis upper intestinal lipids activate intestine brain liver neural axis regulate glucose homeostasis demonstrate direct administration lipids upper intestine increased upper intestinal long chain fatty acyl-coenzyme lcfa coa levels suppressed glucose production co infusion acyl coa synthase inhibitor triacsin c anaesthetic tetracaine duodenal lipids abolished inhibition glucose production indicating upper intestinal lcfa coas regulate glucose production preabsorptive state subdiaphragmatic vagotomy gut vagal deafferentation interrupts neural connection gut brain blocks ability upper intestinal lipids inhibit glucose production direct administration n methyl d aspartate ion channel blocker mk fourth ventricle nucleus solitary tract gut sensory fibres terminate abolished upper intestinal lipid induced inhibition glucose production finally hepatic vagotomy negated inhibitory effects upper intestinal lipids glucose production findings indicate upper intestinal lipids activate intestine brain liver neural axis inhibit glucose production thereby reveal previously unappreciated pathway regulates glucose homeostasis
