dna double-strand breaks trigger genome-wide sister-chromatid cohesion eco1 ctf7 
faithful chromosome segregation repair dna double-strand breaks dsbs require cohesin protein complex mediates sister-chromatid cohesion cohesion sister chromatids thought generated ongoing dna replication obligate coupling cohesion establishment factors eco1 ctf7 replisome using budding yeast challenge model showing cohesion generated eco1-dependent replication-independent mechanism response dsbs g2/m furthermore studies reveal eco1 two functions: cohesive activity conserved acetyltransferase activity triggers generation cohesion response dsb dna damage checkpoint finally dsb-induced cohesion limited broken chromosomes occurs also unbroken chromosomes suggesting dna damage checkpoint eco1 provides genome-wide protection chromosome integrity
