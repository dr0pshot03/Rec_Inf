maintenance genome stability saccharomyces cerevisiae
human cancer cells show signs genome instability ranging elevated mutation rates gross chromosomal rearrangements alterations chromosome number little known molecular mechanisms generate instability suppressed normal cells recent studies yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae begun uncover extensive redundant pathways keep rate genome rearrangements low levels studies review implicated genes suppression genome instability including genes function s-phase checkpoints recombination pathways telomere maintenance human homologs several genes well-established roles tumor suppressors consistent hypothesis mechanisms preserving genome stability yeast mechanisms go awry cancer
