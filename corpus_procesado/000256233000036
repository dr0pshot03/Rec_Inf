cytosolic iron chaperone delivers iron ferritin 
ferritins main iron storage proteins found animals plants bacteria capacity store iron ferritin essential life mammals mechanism cytosolic iron delivered ferritin unknown human ferritins expressed yeast contain little iron human poly rc binding protein pcbp1 increased amount iron loaded ferritin expressed yeast pcbp1 bound ferritin vivo bound iron facilitated iron loading ferritin vitro depletion pcbp1 human cells inhibited ferritin iron loading increased cytosolic iron pools thus pcbp1 can function cytosolic iron chaperone delivery iron ferritin
