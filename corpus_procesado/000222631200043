first cleavage plane mouse egg predetermined defined topology two apposing pronuclei 
studies experimentally manipulated embryos- led long-held conclusion polarity mouse embryo remains undetermined blastocyst stage however recent studies- reporting embryonic abembryonic axis blastocyst arises perpendicular first cleavage plane hence animal vegetal axis zygote led claim axis mouse embryo already specified egg show specification axis egg time-lapse recordings show second polar body mark stationary animal pole instead half embryos moves towards first cleavage plane first cleavage plane coincides plane defined two apposing pronuclei moved centre egg pronuclear transfer experiments confirm first cleavage plane determined early interphase rather specified newly formed topology two pronuclei microtubule networks allow mixing parental chromosomes dividing two may involved processes
