potassium channel receptor site inactivation gate quaternary amine inhibitors 
many voltage-dependent k+ channels open membrane depolarized rapidly close process called inactivation neurons use inactivating k+ channels modulate firing frequency shaker-type k+ channels inactivation gate responsible closing channel formed channels cytoplasmic amino terminus show central cavity inner pore k+ channel form receptor site inactivation gate small-molecule inhibitors propose inactivation occurs sequential reaction gate binds initially cytoplasmic channel surface enters pore extended peptide mechanism accounts functional properties k+ channel inactivation indicates cavity may site action certain drugs alter cation channel function
