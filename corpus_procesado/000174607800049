rac function regulation drosophila development
rac gtpases regulate actin cytoskeleton control changes cell shape date analysis rac function development relied heavily use dominant mutant isoforms use loss-of-function mutations show three drosophila rac genes rac1 rac2 mtl overlapping functions control epithelial morphogenesis myoblast fusion axon growth guidance required establishment planar cell polarity suggested basis studies using dominant mutant isoforms guanine nucleotide exchange factor trio essential rac function axon growth guidance epithelial morphogenesis myoblast fusion different rac activators thus act different developmental processes specific cellular response rac activation may determined upstream activator specific rac protein involved
