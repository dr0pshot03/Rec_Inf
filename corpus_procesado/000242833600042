impact features stardust: implications comet 81p/wild dust 
particles emanating comet 81p/ wild collided stardust spacecraft kilometers per second producing hypervelocity impact features collector surfaces returned earth morphologies surprisingly diverse features created particles varying dense mineral grains loosely bound polymineralic aggregates ranging tens nanometers hundreds micrometers size cumulative size distribution wild dust shallower comet halley yet steeper comet grigg-skjellerup
