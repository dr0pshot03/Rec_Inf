galectin targets damaged vesicles autophagy defend cells bacterial invasion
autophagy defends mammalian cytosol bacterial infection- efficient pathogen engulfment mediated cargo-selecting autophagy adaptors rely unidentified pattern-recognition danger receptors label invading pathogens autophagy cargo typically polyubiquitin coating- show human cells galectin also known lgals8 cytosolic lectin danger receptor restricts salmonella proliferation galectin monitors endosomal lysosomal integrity detects bacterial invasion binding host glycans exposed damaged salmonella-containing vacuoles recruiting ndp52 also known calcoco2 galectin activates antibacterial autophagy galectin--dependent recruitment ndp52 salmonella-containing vesicles transient followed ubiquitin-dependent ndp52 recruitment galectin also detects sterile damage endosomes lysosomes well invasion listeria shigella suggest galectin serves versatile receptor vesicle-damaging pathogens results illustrate cells deploy danger receptor galectin combat infection monitoring endosomal lysosomal integrity basis specific lack complex carbohydrates cytosol
