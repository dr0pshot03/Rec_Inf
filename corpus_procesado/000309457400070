monkeys making value-based decisions lip neurons encode cue salience action value 
monkeys deciding alternative saccadic eye movements lateral intraparietal lip neurons representing saccade fire rate proportional value reward expected upon completion observation interpreted indicating lip neurons encode saccadic value mediate value-based decisions saccades show lip neurons representing given saccade fire strongly will yield large reward also will incur large penalty finding indicates lip neurons sensitive motivational salience cues compatible neither idea lip neurons represent action value idea value-based decisions take place lip neurons
