spontaneous network formation among cooperative rna replicators 
origins life earth required establishment self-replicating chemical systems capable maintaining evolving biological information rna world single self-replicating rnas faced extreme challenge possessing mutation rate low enough sustain information compete successfully molecular parasites limited evolvability thus theoretical analyses suggest networks interacting molecules likely develop sustain life-like behaviour show mixtures rna fragments self-assemble self-replicating ribozymes spontaneously form cooperative catalytic cycles networks find specific three-membered network highly cooperative growth dynamics cooperative networks competed directly selfish autocatalytic cycles former grow faster indicating intrinsic ability rna populations evolve greater complexity cooperation can observe evolvability networks vitro selection experiments highlight advantages cooperative behaviour even molecular stages nascent life
