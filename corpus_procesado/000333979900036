transcriptional landscape prenatal human brain 
anatomical functional architecture human brain mainly determined prenatal transcriptional processes describe anatomically comprehensive atlas mid-gestational human brain including de novo reference atlases situ hybridization ultra-high-resolution magnetic resonance imagingmri microarray analysis highly discrete laser-microdissected brain regions developing cerebral cortex transcriptional differences found different proliferative post-mitotic layers wherein laminar signatures reflect cellular composition developmental processes cytoarchitectural differences human mouse molecular correlates including species differences gene expression subplate although surprisingly find minimal differences inner outer subventricular zones even though outer zone expanded humans germinal post-mitotic cortical layers exhibit fronto-temporal gradients particular enrichment frontal lobe finally many neurodevelopmental disorder human-evolution-related genes show patterned expression potentially underlying unique features human cortical formation data provide rich freely-accessible resource understanding human brain development
