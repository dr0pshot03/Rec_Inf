cell fusion-independent differentiation neural stem cells endothelial lineage
somatic stem cells claimed possess unexpectedly broad differentiation potential referred plasticity induced exposing stem cells extracellular developmental signals lineages mixed-cell cultures- recently experimental evidence supporting existence stem-cell plasticity refuted stem cells shown adopt functional features lineages means cell-fusion-mediated acquisition lineage-specific determinants chromosomal dna rather signal-mediated differentiation study co-cultured mouse neural stem cells nscs committed become neurons glial cells human endothelial cells form lining blood vessels show presence endothelial cells six per cent nsc population converted cells express neuronal glial markers instead showed stable expression multiple endothelial markers capacity form capillary networks surprising nscs endothelial cells believed develop ectoderm mesoderm respectively experiments endothelial cells killed fixation co-culture live nscs prevent cell fusion karyotyping analyses revealed nscs differentiated endothelial-like cells independently cell fusion conclude stem-cell plasticity true characteristic nscs conversion nscs unanticipated cell types can accomplished without cell fusion
