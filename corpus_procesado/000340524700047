arabidopsis nac45/ direct sieve element morphogenesis culminating enucleation 
photoassimilates sugars transported phloem sieve element cells plants adapted effective transport sieve elements develop enucleated living cells used electron microscope imaging three-dimensional reconstruction follow sieve element morphogenesis arabidopsis show sieve element differentiation involves enucleation nuclear contents released degraded cytoplasm time organelles rearranged cytosol degraded cellular reorganizations orchestrated genetically redundant nac domain-containing transcription factors nac45 nac86 nac45/ among nac45/ targets identified family genes required enucleation encode proteins nuclease domains thus sieve elements differentiate specialized autolysis mechanism
