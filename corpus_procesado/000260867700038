ubiquitin-like protein involved proteasome pathway mycobacterium tuberculosis
protein modifier ubiquitin signal proteasome-mediated degradation eukaryotes proteasome bearing prokaryotes thought degrade proteins via ubiquitinin-dependent pathway identified prokaryotic ubiquitin like protein pup rv2111c specifically conjugated proteasome substrates pathogen mycobacterium tuberculosis pupylation occurred lysines required proteasome accessory factor pafa pafa mutant pupylated proteins absent substrates accumulated thereby connecting pupylation degradation although analogous ubiquitylation pupylation appears proceed different chemistry thus like eukaryotes bacteria may use small protein modifier control protein stability
