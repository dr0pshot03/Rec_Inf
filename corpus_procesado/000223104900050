multiple rare alleles contribute low plasma levels hdl cholesterol 
heritable variation complex traits generally considered conferred common dna sequence polymorphisms tested whether rare dna sequence variants collectively contribute variation plasma levels high-density lipoprotein cholesterol hdl-c sequenced three candidate genes abca1 apoa1 lcat cause mendelian forms low hdl-c levels individuals population-based study nonsynonymous sequence variants significantly common % versus % individuals low hdl-c <fifth percentile high hdl-c >95th percentile similar findings obtained independent population biochemical studies indicated sequence variants low hdl-c group functionally important thus rare alleles major phenotypic effects contribute significantly low plasma hdl-c levels general population
