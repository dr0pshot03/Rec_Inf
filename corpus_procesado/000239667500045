n c-terminal snare complex assembly promotes rapid membrane fusion 
assembly soluble n-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors snares syntaxin snap- synaptobrevin thought driving force exocytosis synaptic vesicles however whereas exocytosis triggered millisecond time scale snare-mediated fusion liposomes requires hours completion challenges idea key role snares final steps exocytosis found liposome fusion dramatically accelerated stabilized syntaxin/snap- acceptor complex used thus snares capacity execute fusion speed required neuronal secretion demonstrating maintenance acceptor complexes critical step biological fusion reactions
