trophic action leptin hypothalamic neurons regulate feeding
adult mammals adipocyte-derived hormone leptin acts brain reduce food intake regulating activity neurons arcuate nucleus hypothalamus arh report neural projection pathways arh permanently disrupted leptin-deficient lepob/lepob mice leptin treatment adulthood reverse neuroanatomical defects however treatment lepob/lepob neonates exogenous leptin rescues development arh projections leptin promotes neurite outgrowth arh neurons vitro results suggest leptin plays neurotrophic role development hypothalamus activity restricted neonatal critical period precedes leptins acute regulation food intake adults
