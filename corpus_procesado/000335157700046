chemical inhibition nat10 corrects defects laminopathic cells 
down-regulation mutations nuclear-architecture proteins lamin c cause misshapen nuclei altered chromatin organization associated cancer laminopathies including premature-aging disease hutchinson-gilford progeria syndrome hgps identified small molecule "remodelin" improved nuclear architecture chromatin organization fitness human lamin a/c-depleted cells hgps-derived patient cells decreased markers dna damage cells using combination chemical cellular genetic approaches identified acetyl-transferase protein nat10 target remodelin mediated nuclear shape rescue laminopathic cells via microtubule reorganization findings provide insights nat10 affects nuclear architecture suggest alternative strategies treating laminopathies aging
