imaging arsenic cottrell atmospheres around silicon defects three-dimensional atom probe tomography
discrete control individual dopant impurity atoms critical electrical characteristics fabrication silicon nanodevices unavoidable introduction defects silicon implantation process may prevent uniform distribution dopant atoms cottrell atmospheres one nonuniformity occur interstitial atoms interact dislocations pinning dislocation trapping interstitial atom probe tomography used quantify location elemental identity atoms proximate defects silicon found cottrell atmospheres arsenic atoms form around defects ion implantation annealing furthermore atmospheres persist surrounding dislocation loops even considerable thermal treatment properly accommodated atmospheres create dopant fluctuations ultimately limit scalability silicon devices
