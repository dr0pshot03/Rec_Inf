femtosecond x-ray measurement coherent lattice vibrations near lindemann stability limit 
study phase-transition dynamics solids beyond time-averaged kinetic description requires direct measurement changes atomic configuration along physical pathways leading new phase timescale interest range - - s recently optical techniques capable providing adequate time resolution albeit indirect sensitivity structural arrangement ultrafast laser-induced changes long-range order recently directly established materials using time-resolved x-ray diffraction- however measurement atomic displacements within unit cell well relationship stability limit structural phase- date remained obscure report time-resolved x-ray diffraction measurements coherent atomic displacement lattice atoms photoexcited bismuth close phase transition excitation large-amplitude coherent optical phonons gives rise periodic modulation x-ray diffraction efficiency stronger excitation corresponding atomic displacements exceeding per cent nearest-neighbour distance-near lindemann limit-leads subsequent loss long-range order probably due melting material
