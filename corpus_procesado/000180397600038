systematic functional analysis caenorhabditis elegans genome using rnai 
principal challenge currently facing biologists connect complete dna sequence organism development behaviour large-scale targeted-deletions successful defining gene functions single-celled yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae comparable analyses yet performed animal describe use rna interference inhibit function similar to86% predicted genes c elegans identified mutant phenotypes genes two-thirds previously associated phenotype find genes similar functions clustered distinct multi-megabase regions individual chromosomes; genes regions tend share transcriptional profiles resulting data set reusable rnai library bacterial clones will facilitate systematic analyses connections among gene sequence chromosomal location gene function c elegans
