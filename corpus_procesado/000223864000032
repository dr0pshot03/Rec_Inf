exceptional astronomical seeing conditions dome c antarctica
one important considerations planning next generation ground-based optical astronomical telescopes choose site excellent seeing-the jitter apparent position star caused light bending passes regions differing refractive index earths atmosphere best mid-latitude sites median seeing ranging arcsec refs sites antarctic plateau unique atmospheric properties make worth investigating potential observatory locations previous testing us amundsen-scott south pole station however demonstrated poor seeing averaging arcsec refs report observations wintertime seeing dome c ref high point antarctic plateau latitude degrees s results remarkable: median seeing arcsec arcsec per cent time telescope placed dome c compete one times larger best mid-latitude observatories interferometer based site work projects otherwise require space mission
