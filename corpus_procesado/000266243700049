high-frequency modification plant genes using engineered zinc-finger nucleases
efficient method making directed dna sequence modifications plant genes gene targeting present lacking thereby frustrating efforts dissect plant gene function engineer crop plants better meet worlds burgeoning need food fibre fuel zinc-finger nucleases zfns-enzymes engineered create dna double-strand breaks specific loci-are potent stimulators gene targeting example can used precisely modify engineered reporter genes plants demonstrate high-frequency zfn-stimulated gene targeting endogenous plant genes namely tobacco acetolactate synthase genes als sura surb specific mutations known confer resistance imidazolinone sulphonylurea herbicides herbicide-resistance mutations introduced sur loci zfn-mediated gene targeting frequencies exceeding % transformed cells mutations far kilobases zfn cleavage site % recombinant plants modifications multiple sur alleles observed high frequency gene targeting indicates now possible efficiently make targeted sequence changes endogenous plant genes
