asymmetric coevolutionary networks facilitate biodiversity maintenance 
mutualistic interactions plants pollinators seed dispersers played major role maintenance earths biodiversity investigate coevolutionary interactions shaped within species-rich communities characterized architecture array quantitative mutualistic networks spanning broad geographic range coevolutionary networks highly asymmetric plant species depends strongly animal species animal depends weakly plant using simple dynamical model showed asymmetries inherent coevolutionary networks may enhance long-term coexistence facilitate biodiversity maintenance
