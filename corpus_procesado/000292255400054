mechanism rad51-dependent dna interstrand cross-link repair 
dna interstrand cross-links icls toxic dna lesions whose repair s phase eukaryotic cells incompletely understood xenopus egg extracts icl repair initiated two replication forks converge lesion dual incisions create dna double-strand break dsb one sister chromatid whereas lesion bypass restores sister report broken sister chromatid repaired via rad51-dependent strand invasion regenerated sister recombination acts downstream fanci-fancd2 yet rad51 binds icl-stalled replication forks independently fanci-fancd2 dsb formation results elucidate functional link fanconi anemia pathway recombination machinery icl repair addition demonstrate complete repair dsb via homologous recombination vitro
