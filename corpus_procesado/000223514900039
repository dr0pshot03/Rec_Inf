ionic liquids eutectic mixtures solvent template synthesis zeolite analogues
challenges associated synthesizing porous materials mean new classes zeolites zeotypes-such aluminosilicate zeolites zeolite analogues-together new methods preparing known zeotypes continue great importance normally materials prepared hydrothermally water solvent sealed autoclave autogenous pressure reaction mixture usually includes organic template structure-directing agent guides synthesis pathway towards particular structures report preparation aluminophosphate zeolite analogues using ionic liquids eutectic mixtures imidazolium-based ionic liquid acts solvent template leading four zeotype frameworks different experimental conditions structural characteristics materials can traced back solvent chemistry used vanishingly low vapour pressure ionic liquids synthesis takes place ambient pressure eliminating safety concerns associated high hydrothermal pressures ionic liquid can also recycled use choline chloride/urea eutectic mixture also used preparation new zeotype framework
