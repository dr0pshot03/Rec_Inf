challenges associated synthesizing porous materials1 mean new classes zeolites zeotypes-such aluminosilicate zeolites23 zeolite analogues4-together new methods preparing known zeotypes5 continue great importance normally materials prepared hydrothermally water solvent sealed autoclave autogenous pressure6 reaction mixture usually includes organic template structure-directing agent guides synthesis pathway towards particular structures report preparation aluminophosphate zeolite analogues using ionic liquids7 eutectic mixtures8 imidazolium-based ionic liquid acts solvent template leading four zeotype frameworks different experimental conditions structural characteristics materials can traced back solvent chemistry used vanishingly low vapour pressure ionic liquids synthesis takes place ambient pressure eliminating safety concerns associated high hydrothermal pressures ionic liquid can also recycled use choline chloride/urea eutectic mixture8 also used preparation new zeotype framework
