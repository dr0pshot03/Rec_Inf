cis-acting regulatory variation human genome 
systematic screening human genome genetic variants affect gene regulation advance fundamental understanding phenotypic diversity lead identification alleles modify disease risk several challenges localizing regulatory polymorphisms including wide spectrum cis-acting regulatory mechanisms inconsistent effects regulatory variants different tissues difficulty isolating causal variants linkage disequilibrium many variants discuss current state knowledge technologies used mapping characterizing genetic variation controlling human gene expression
