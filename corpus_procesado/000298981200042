subnanometre-resolution structure intact thermus thermophilus h+-driven atp synthase
ion-translocating rotary atpases serve either atp synthases using energy transmembrane ion motive force create cells supply atp transmembrane ion pumps powered atp hydrolysis members family enzymes contain two rotary motors: one couples ion translocation rotation one couples rotation atp synthesis hydrolysis atp synthesis ion translocation membrane-bound region complex causes rotation central rotor drives conformational changes atp synthesis catalytic region complex structural models available intact membrane region ion-translocating rotary atpase present angstrom resolution map h+-driven atp synthase thermus thermophilus obtained electron cryomicroscopy single particles ice kilodalton complex overall subunit composition abcdefgil membrane-bound motor consists ring l subunits carboxy-terminal region subunit equivalent c subunits rotary atpases respectively map shows ring contains l subunits subunit eight transmembrane helices l ring subunit surprisingly small contact area middle membrane helices subunit making contacts two different l subunits transmembrane helices subunit form bundles serve half-channels across membrane first half-channel conducting protons periplasm l ring second half-channel conducting protons l ring cytoplasm structure therefore suggests mechanism transmembrane proton motive force converted rotation rotary atpases
