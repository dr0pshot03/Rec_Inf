antiviral immunity drosophila requires systemic rna interference spread 
multicellular organisms evolved sophisticated defence systems confer protection pathogens important characteristic immune systems ability act locally site infection distal uninfected locations1- insects drosophila melanogaster rna interference rnai mediates antiviral immunity5- however antiviral rnai defence flies seems local cell-autonomous process flies thought unable generate systemic rnai response8 show recently defined double-stranded rnadsrna uptake pathway9 essential effective antiviral rnai immunity adult flies mutant flies defective dsrna uptake pathway hypersensitive infection drosophila c virus sindbis virus mortality dsrna-uptake-defective flies accompanied -to -fold increases viral titres higher levels viral rna furthermore inoculating naked dsrna flies elicited sequence-specific antiviral immune response required intact dsrna uptake pathway findings suggest spread dsrna uninfected sites essential effective antiviral immunity notably infection green fluorescent protein gfp-tagged sindbis virus suppressed expression host-encoded gfp distal site thus similar protein-based immunity vertebrates antiviral rnai response flies also relies systemic spread virus-specific immunity signal
