asymmetric inheritance mother versus daughter centrosome stem cell division 
adult stem cells often divide asymmetrically produce one self-renewed stem cell one differentiating cell thus maintaining populations asymmetric outcome stem cell divisions can specified oriented spindle local self-renewal signals stem cell niche show developmentally programmed asymmetric behavior inheritance mother daughter centrosomes underlies stereotyped spindle orientation asymmetric outcome stem cell divisions drosophila male germ line mother centrosome remains anchored near niche daughter centrosome migrates opposite side cell spindle formation
