novel retinoblastoma therapy genomic epigenetic analyses 
retinoblastoma aggressive childhood cancer developing retina initiated biallelic loss rb1 tumours progress quickly following rb1 inactivation underlying mechanism known show retinoblastoma genome stable multiple cancer pathways can epigenetically deregulated identify mutations cooperate rb1 loss performed whole-genome sequencing retinoblastomas overall mutational rate low rb1 known cancer gene mutated evaluated role rb1 genome stability considered non-genetic mechanisms cancer pathway deregulation example proto-oncogene syk upregulated retinoblastoma required tumour cell survival targeting syk small-molecule inhibitor induced retinoblastoma tumour cell death vitro vivo thus retinoblastomas may develop quickly result epigenetic deregulation key cancer pathways direct indirect result rb1 loss
