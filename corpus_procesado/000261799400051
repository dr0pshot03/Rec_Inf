circadian clock arabidopsis roots simplified slave version clock shoots
circadian oscillator eukaryotes consists several interlocking feedback loops expression clock genes controlled generally assumed plant cells contain essentially identical cell autonomous multiloop clocks show circadian clock roots mature arabidopsis plants differs markedly shoots root clock synchronized photosynthesis related signal shoot two feedback loops plant circadian clock disengaged roots two key clock components transcription factors cca1 lhy able inhibit gene expression shoots roots thus plant clock organ specific organ autonomous
