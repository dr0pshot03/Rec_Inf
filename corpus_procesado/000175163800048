ecosystem consequences species richness composition pond food webs
resolving current concerns role biodiversity ecosystems calls understanding separate roles changes species numbers composition recent work shows primary productivity often always saturates species richness within single trophic levels- however interpretation patterns must consider variation biodiversity necessarily associated changes species composition identity- changes biodiversity often occur across multiple trophic levels present results mesocosm experiment independently manipulated species richness species composition across multiple trophic levels pond food webs contrast previous studies focused single trophic levels found productivity either idiosyncratic increases respect species richness richness influences trophic structure however composition species within richness levels can equally marked effects ecosystems average effects richness per se indirect evidence suggests richness associated changes species composition affect ecosystem attributes indirect effects trophic interactions among species features highly characteristic natural complex ecosystems
