optical microscopy using single-molecule light source
rapid progress science nanoscopic scales promoted increasing interest techniques ultrahigh-resolution optical microscopy diffraction limit can surpassed illuminating object near field sub-wavelength aperture end sharp metallic probe proposed modifications technique involve replacing physical aperture nanoscopic active light source advances spatial spectral detection individual fluorescent molecules using near-field far-field methods suggest possibility using single molecule illumination source present optical images taken single molecule point-like source illumination combining fluorescence excitation spectroscopy shear-force microscopy single-molecule probe potential achieving molecular resolution optical microscopy also facilitate controlled studies nanometre-scale phenomena resonant energy transfer improved lateral axial spatial resolution
