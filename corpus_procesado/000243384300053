histone arginine methylation regulates pluripotency early mouse embryo
generally accepted mammalian embryo starts development cells identical inside outside cells form differences cells first emerge however recent findings show cells mouse embryo can differ developmental fate potency early four-cell stage- differences depend orientation order cleavage divisions generated epigenetic marks suggested involved sustaining pluripotency considered developmental properties might achieved epigenetic mechanisms show modification histone h3 methylation specific arginine residues correlated cell fate potency levels h3 methylation specific arginine residues maximal four-cell blastomeres will contribute inner cell mass icm polar trophectoderm undertake full development combined together chimaeras arginine methylation h3 minimal cells whose progeny contributes mural trophectoderm show compromised development combined chimaeras suggests higher levels h3 arginine methylation predispose blastomeres contribute pluripotent cells icm confirm prediction overexpressing h3-specific arginine methyltransferase carm1 individual blastomeres show directs progeny icm results dramatic upregulation nanog sox2 thus results identify specific histone modifications earliest known epigenetic marker contributing development icm show manipulation epigenetic information influences cell fate determination
