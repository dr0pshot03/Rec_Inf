signatures cool gas fueling star-forming galaxy redshift
galaxies thought fed continuous accretion intergalactic gas direct observational evidence elusive accreted gas expected orbit galaxys halo delivering just fuel star formation also angular momentum galaxy leading distinct kinematic signatures report observations showing distinct signatures near typical distant star-forming galaxy gas detected using background quasar passing kiloparsecs host observations indicate gas accretion plays major role galaxy growth estimated accretion rate comparable star-formation rate
