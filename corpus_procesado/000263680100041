intracortical circuits pyramidal neurons reflect long-range axonal targets 
cortical columns generate separate streams information distributed numerous cortical subcortical brain regions asked whether local intracortical circuits reflect different processing streams testing whether intracortical connectivity among pyramidal neurons reflects long-range axonal targets recorded simultaneously four retrogradely labelled pyramidal neurons projected superior colliculus contralateral striatum contralateral cortex assess synaptic connectivity show probability synaptic connection depends functional identities presynaptic postsynaptic neurons first found frequency monosynaptic connections among corticostriatal pyramidal neurons significantly higher among corticocortical corticotectal pyramidal neurons show probability feed-forward connections corticocortical neurons corticotectal neurons approximately three four-fold higher probability monosynaptic connections among corticocortical corticotectal cells moreover found average axodendritic overlap presynaptic postsynaptic pyramidal neurons fully explain differences connection probability observed selective synaptic interactions describe demonstrate organization local networks pyramidal cells reflects long-range targets presynaptic postsynaptic neurons
