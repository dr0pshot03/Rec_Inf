correlation nanosecond x-ray flashes stick-slip friction peeling tape 
relative motion two contacting surfaces can produce visible light called triboluminescence concentration diffuse mechanical energy electromagnetic radiation previously observed extend even x-ray energies report peeling common adhesive tape moderate vacuum produces radio visible emission along nanosecond mw x ray pulses correlated stick slip peeling events observed kev peak x ray energy various models give competing picture discharge process length gap separating faces tape mm moment emission intensity x ray triboluminescence allowed us use source x ray imaging limits energies flash widths can achieved beyond current theories tribology
