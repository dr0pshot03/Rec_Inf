crystal structure [fe]-hydrogenase reveals geometry active site 
biological formation consumption molecular hydrogen h2 catalyzed hydrogenases three phylogenetically unrelated types known: [ nife] hydrogenases [ fefe] hydrogenases [ fe] hydrogenase present crystal structure [ fe] hydrogenase angstrom resolution showing mononuclear iron coordinated sulfur cysteine two carbon monoxide co molecules sp2 hybridized nitrogen pyridinol compound back bonding properties similar cyanide three dimensional arrangement ligands similar thiolate co cyanide ligated low spin iron binuclear [ nife] [ fefe] hydrogenases although enzymes evolved independently co cyanide ligands found metalloenzyme related iron ligation pattern hydrogenases exemplifies convergent evolution presumably plays essential role h2 activation finding may stimulate ongoing synthesis catalysts substitute platinum applications fuel cells
