green catalytic oxidation alcohols water
alcohol oxidations typically performed stoichiometric reagents generate heavy-metal waste usually run chlorinated solvents water-soluble palladiumll bathophenanthroline complex stable recyclable catalyst selective aerobic oxidation wide range alcohols aldehydes ketones carboxylic acids biphasic water-alcohol system use water solvent air oxidant makes reaction interesting economic environmental point view
