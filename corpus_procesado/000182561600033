principle gating charge movement voltage-dependent k+ channel 
steep dependence channel opening membrane voltage allows voltage-dependent k+ channels turn almost like switch opening driven movement gating charges originate arginine residues helical s4 segments protein s4 segment forms half voltage-sensor paddle channels outer perimeter show voltage-sensor paddles positioned inside membrane near intracellular surface channel closed paddles move large distance across membrane inside outside channel opens kvap channels reconstituted planar lipid membranes studied using monoclonal fab fragments voltage-sensor toxin avidin binding tethered biotin findings lead us conclude voltage-sensor paddles operate somewhat like hydrophobic cations attached levers enabling membrane electric field open close pore
