analysis dna sequence duplication history human chromosome 
present finished sequence human chromosome together high-quality gene catalogue chromosome one seven human chromosomes high rate segmental duplication carried detailed analysis duplication structure chromosome segmental duplications chromosome largely clustered two regions proximal distal 15q proximal region notable recombination among segmental duplications can result deletions causing prader-willi angelman syndromes sequence analysis shows proximal distal regions 15q share extensive ancient similarity using simple approach able reconstruct many events current duplication structure arose find intrachromosomal duplications seem share common ancestry finally demonstrate remaining gaps genome sequence probably due structural polymorphisms haplotypes may explain significant fraction gaps remaining human genome
