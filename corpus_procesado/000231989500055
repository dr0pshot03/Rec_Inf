extensive diversity ig-superfamily proteins immune system insects
extensive somatic diversification immune receptors hallmark higher vertebrates however whether molecular diversity contributes immune protection invertebrates unknown present evidence drosophila immune-competent cells potential express isoforms immunoglobulin ig-superfamily receptor syndrome cell adhesion molecule dscam secreted protein isoforms dscam detected hemolymph hemocyte-specific loss dscam impaired efficiency phagocytic uptake bacteria possibly due reduced bacteria[ binding importantly molecular diversity dscam transcripts generated mechanism alternative splicing highly conserved across major insect orders suggesting unsuspected molecular complexity innate immune system insects
