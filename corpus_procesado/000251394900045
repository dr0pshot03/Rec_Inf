bv8 regulates myeloid-cell-dependent tumour angiogenesis 
bone marrow derived cells facilitate tumour angiogenesis molecular mechanisms facilitation incompletely understood previously shown related eg vegf bv8 proteins also known prokineticin prok1 prokineticin prok2 promote tissue specific angiogenesis haematopoietic cell mobilization unlike eg vegf bv8 expressed bone marrow show implantation tumour cells mice resulted upregulation bv8 cd11b+ gr1+ myeloid cells identified granulocyte colony stimulating factor major positive regulator bv8 expression anti bv8 antibodies reduced cd11b+ gr1+ cell mobilization elicited granulocyte colony stimulating factor adenoviral delivery bv8 tumours shown promote angiogenesis anti bv8 antibodies inhibited growth several tumours mice suppressed angiogenesis anti bv8 treatment also reduced cd11b+ gr1+ cells peripheral blood tumours effects anti bv8 antibodies additive anti vegf antibodies cytotoxic chemotherapy thus bv8 modulates mobilization cd11b+ gr1+ cells bone marrow tumour development also promotes angiogenesis locally
