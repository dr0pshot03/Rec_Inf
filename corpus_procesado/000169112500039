stability atmospheric co2 levels across triassic/jurassic boundary
triassic/jurassic boundary million years ago associated widespread extinctions marine terrestrial biota cause extinctions widely attributed eruption flood basalts central atlantic magmatic province- volcanic event thought released significant amounts co2 atmosphere led catastrophic greenhouse warming- evidence co2-induced extinction remains equivocal present carbon isotope compositions pedogenic calcite palaeosol formations spanning myr period across triassic/jurassic boundary using standard diffusion model interpret isotopic data represent rise atmospheric co2 concentrations ppm across boundary compared previous estimates - ppm increase relative stability atmospheric co2 across boundary suggests environmental degradation extinctions early jurassic caused volcanic outgassing co2 volcanic effects-such release atmospheric aerosols tectonically driven sea-level change may responsible event
