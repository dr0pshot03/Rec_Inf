formation fragmentation disks around primordial protostars
first stars form universe heralded end cosmic dark ages introduced new physical processes shaped early cosmic evolution now thought stars lived short solitary lives one extremely massive star possibly wide binary system forming dark-matter minihalo describe numerical simulations show stars contrary often members tight multiple systems results show disks formed around first young stars unstable gravitational fragmentation possibly producing small binary higher-order systems separations small distance earth sun
