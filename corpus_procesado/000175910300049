lrr receptor kinase involved perception peptide plant hormone phytosulfokine 
sulfated peptide phytosulfokine psk intercellular signal plays key role cellular dedifferentiation proliferation plants using ligand-based affinity chromatography purified -kilodalton membrane protein specifically interacting psk carrot microsomal fractions corresponding complementary dna encodes -amino acid receptor kinase contains extracellular leucine-rich repeats single transmembrane domain cytoplasmic kinase domain overexpression receptor kinase carrot cells caused enhanced callus growth response psk substantial increase number tritium-labeled psk binding sites suggesting psk receptor kinase act ligand-receptor pair
