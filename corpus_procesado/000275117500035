linking dwarf galaxies halo building blocks metal-poor star sculptor 
current cosmological models indicate milky ways stellar halo assembled many smaller systems basis apparent absence metal-poor stars present-day dwarf galaxies recent studies claimed true galactic building blocks must vastly different surviving dwarfs discovery extremely iron-poor star s1020549 sculptor dwarf galaxy based medium-resolution spectrum cast doubt conclusion verification iron-deficiency however measurements additional elements a-element mg necessary demonstrate type stars produced metals found dwarf galaxies galactic halo can dwarf galaxy stars conclusively linked early stellar halo assembly report high-resolution spectroscopic abundances elements s1020549 confirming iron abundance less /000th sun showing overall abundance pattern follows seen low-metallicity halo stars including a-elements chemical similarity indicates systems destroyed form halo billions years ago fundamentally different progenitors present-day dwarfs suggests early chemical enrichment galaxies may nearly identical
