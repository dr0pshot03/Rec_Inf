impact-activated solidification dense suspensions via dynamic jamming fronts 
although liquids typically flow around intruding objects counterintuitive phenomenon occurs dense suspensions micrometre-sized particles: become liquid-like perturbed lightly harden driven strongly- rheological experiments investigated thickening arises shear linked hydrodynamic interactions granular dilation however neither mechanisms alone can explain ability suspensions generate large positive normal stresses impact illustrate phenomenon stresses can large enough allow person run across suspension without sinking far exceed upper limit observed shear extension show stresses originate impact-generated solidification front transforms initially compressible particle matrix rapidly growing jammed region ultimately leading extraordinary amounts momentum absorption using high-speed videography embedded force sensing x-ray imaging capture detailed dynamics process decelerates metal rod hitting suspension cornflour cornstarch water develop model dynamic solidification effect surrounding suspension reproduces observed behaviour quantitatively findings suggest prior interpretations impact resistance dominated shear thickening need revisited
