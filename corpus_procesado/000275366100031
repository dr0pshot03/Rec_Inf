non-abelian states matter
quantum mechanics classifies elementary particles either fermions bosons classification crucial understanding variety physical systems lasers metals superconductors certain two-dimensional systems interactions electrons atoms lead formation quasiparticles break fermion-boson dichotomy particularly interesting alternative offered non-abelian states matter presence quasiparticles makes ground state degenerate interchanges identical quasiparticles shift system different ground states present experimental studies attempt identify non-abelian states systems manifest fractional quantum hall effect states can identified may become useful quantum computation
