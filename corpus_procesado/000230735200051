independent codes spatial episodic memory hippocampal neuronal ensembles
hippocampal neurons recorded conditions recording chamber varied location remained unchanged versus conditions identical chamber encountered different places two forms neuronal pattern separation occurred variable cue-constant place condition firing rates active cells varied often order magnitude whereas location firing remained constant variable place-constant cue condition location rates changed population vectors given location chamber statistically independent independent encoding schemes may enable simultaneous representation spatial episodic memory information
