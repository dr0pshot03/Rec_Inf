daily electrical silencing mammalian circadian clock 
neurons brains suprachiasmatic nuclei scns control timing daily rhythms thought encode time day changing firing frequency high rates day lower rates night scn neurons express key clock gene period per1 found day neurons containing per1 sustain electrically excited state fire whereas non-per1 neurons show previously reported daily variation firing activity using combined experimental theoretical approach explain ionic currents lead unusual electrophysiological behaviors per1 cells unlike mammalian brain cells can survive function depolarized states
