observing multiexciton state singlet fission ensuing ultrafast multielectron transfer 
multiple exciton generation meg refers creation two electron-hole pairs absorption one photon although meg holds great promise proven challenging implement questions remain underlying photo-physical dynamics nanocrystalline well molecular media using model system pentacene/fullerene bilayers femtosecond nonlinear spectroscopies directly observed multiexciton state ensuing singlet fission molecular manifestation meg pentacene data suggest state exists coherent superposition singlet populated optical excitation also found multiple electron transfer state fullerene occurs subpicosecond time scale one order magnitude faster triplet exciton state
