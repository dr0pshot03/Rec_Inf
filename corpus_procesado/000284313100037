entanglement spin waves among four quantum memories 
quantum networks composed quantum nodes interact coherently quantum channels open broad frontier scientific opportunities1 example quantum network can serve web connecting quantum processors computation23 communication4 simulator allowing investigations quantum critical phenomena arising interactions among nodes mediated channels56 physical realization quantum networks generically requires dynamical systems capable generating storing entangled states among multiple quantum memories efficiently transferring stored entanglement quantum channels distribution across network although capabilities demonstrated diverse bipartite systems7- entangled states achieved interconnects capable mapping multipartite entanglement stored quantum memories quantum channels demonstrate measurement-induced entanglement stored four atomic memories; user-controlled coherent transfer atomic entanglement four photonic channels; characterization full quadripartite entanglement using quantum uncertainty relations13- work therefore constitutes advance distribution multipartite entanglement across quantum networks also show entanglement verification method suitable studying entanglement order condensed-matter systems thermal equilibrium1718
