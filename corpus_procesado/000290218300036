functional specificity local synaptic connections neocortical networks
neuronal connectivity fundamental information processing brain therefore understanding mechanisms sensory processing requires uncovering connection patterns neurons relate function coarse scale long-range projections can preferentially link cortical regions similar responses sensory stimuli- local scale dendrites axons overlap substantially functional specificity connections remains unknown determine synaptic connectivity nearby layer / pyramidal neurons vitro response properties first characterized mouse visual cortex vivo found connection probability related similarity visually driven neuronal activity neurons preference oriented stimuli connected twice rate neurons orthogonal orientation preferences neurons responding similarly naturalistic stimuli formed connections much higher rates uncorrelated responses bidirectional synaptic connections found frequently neuronal pairs strongly correlated visual responses results reveal degree functional specificity local synaptic connections visual cortex point existence fine-scale subnetworks dedicated processing related sensory information
