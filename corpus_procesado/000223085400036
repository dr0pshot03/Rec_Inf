apparently normal gamma-ray burst unusually low luminosity
much progress understanding gamma-ray bursts grbs come studies distant events redshift z approximate brightest grbs gamma-rays highly collimated events can seen across universe long suspected nearest common events missed collimated under-energetic report soft gamma-ray observations grb nearest event date z ref duration s peak energy > kev therefore appears typical long-duration grb isotropic gamma-ray energy less equal erg however three orders magnitude smaller cosmological population event well nearby somewhat controversial grb clear outlier isotropic-energy/peak-energy relation luminosity/spectral-lag relations describe majority grbs radio calorimetry shows events under-energetic explosions conclude indeed exist large population under-energetic events
