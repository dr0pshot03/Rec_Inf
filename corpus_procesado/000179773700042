soil warming carbon-cycle feedbacks climate system 
decade-long soil warming experiment mid-latitude hardwood forest documented changes soil carbon nitrogen cycling order investigate consequences changes climate system show whereas soil warming accelerates soil organic matter decay carbon dioxide fluxes atmosphere response small short-lived mid-latitude forest limited size labile soil carbon pool also show warming increases availability mineral nitrogen plants plant growth many mid-latitude forests nitrogen-limited warming potential indirectly stimulate enough carbon storage plants least compensate carbon losses soils results challenge assumptions made climate models lead projections large long-term releases soil carbon response warming forest ecosystems
