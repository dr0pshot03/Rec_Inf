fe-s cluster biosynthesis controls uptake aminoglycosides ros-less death pathway 
bactericidal antibiotics recently proposed kill inducing reactive oxygen species ros production causing destabilization iron-sulfur fe-s clusters generating fenton chemistry find ros response dispensable upon treatment bactericidal antibiotics furthermore demonstrate fe-s clusters required killing aminoglycosides contrast cells using major fe-s cluster biosynthesis machinery isc cells using alternative machinery suf efficiently mature respiratory complexes ii resulting impendence proton motive force pmf required bactericidal aminoglycoside uptake similarly iron limitation cells become intrinsically resistant aminoglycosides switching isc suf down-regulating respiratory complexes conclude fe-s proteins promote aminoglycoside killing enabling uptake
