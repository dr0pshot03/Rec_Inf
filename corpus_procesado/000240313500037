triple-bond reactivity diphosphorus molecules 
report mild method generating diphosphorus molecule synthetic equivalent homogeneous solution; p- allotrope element phosphorus normally obtained extreme conditions example p- kelvin diphosphorus extruded niobium complex designed purpose can trapped efficiently two equivalents organic diene produce organodiphosphorus compound diphosphorus stabilized coordination tungsten pentacarbonyl can generated similarly degrees c stabilized form still efficiently consumes two organic diene molecules every diphosphorus unit
