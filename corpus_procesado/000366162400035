electron-hole pair excitation determines mechanism hydrogen atom adsorption
much translational energy atoms molecules lose collisions surfaces determines whether adsorb scatter fact hydrogen h atoms stick metal surfaces poses basic question momentum energy conservation demands light h atom efficiently transfer energy heavier atoms solid binary collision h atoms efficiently stick metal surfaces show experiments h-atom collisions insulating surface adsorbed xenon layer gold single-crystal surface indeed nearly elastic following predictions energy momentum conservation contrast h-atom collisions bare gold surface exhibit large loss translational energy can reproduced atomic-level simulation describing electron-hole pair excitation
