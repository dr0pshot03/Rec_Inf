comprehensive control atomic motion 
recent work provides general two-step solution trapping cooling atoms first step magnetic stopping paramagnetic atoms use sequence pulsed fields second step single-photon cooling based one-way barrier cooling method related intimately historic problem "maxwells demon" subsequent work l szilard discuss connections single-photon cooling information entropy also outline future application methods fundamental tests hydrogen isotopes
