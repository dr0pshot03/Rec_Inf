origin brittle cleavage iridium 
iridium unique among face-centered cubic metals undergoes brittle cleavage period plastic deformation tensile stress atomistic simulation using quantum-mechanically derived bond-order potential shows iridium two core structures screw dislocation possible: glissile planar core metastable nonplanar core transformation two core structures athermal leads exceptionally high rates cross slip plastic deformation associated athermal cross slip exponential increase dislocation density strong work hardening brittle cleavage natural consequence
