modulated structure solid iodine molecular dissociation high pressure 
application pressure solid iodine forces molecules crystal approach intermolecular distances become comparable bond length iodine; point molecules lose identity essentially dissociated according room-temperature x-ray diffraction studies1 process involves direct dissociation iodine molecules gpa whereas spectroscopic observations23 identified intermediate molecular phases pressures ranging gpa present quasi-hydrostatic powder x-ray diffraction measurements clearly reveal intermediate phase pressure-induced dissociation solid iodine find similar behaviour seen uranium4 structure intermediate phase incommensurately modulated nearest interatomic distances continuously distributed range angstrom shortest interatomic distances falls bond length iodine molecular crystal angstrom nearest interatomic distance fully dissociated monatomic crystal angstrom implying intermediate phase transient state molecular dissociation expect measurements different temperatures will help elucidate origin stability incommensurate structure might lead better understanding molecular-level mechanism pressure-induced dissociation seen molecular crystals hydrogen5 oxygen6 nitrogen7
