two-dimensional phonon transport supported graphene 
reported thermal conductivity kappa suspended graphene watts per meter per kelvin exceeds diamond graphite thus graphene can useful solving heat dissipation problems nanoelectronics however contact substrate affect thermal transport properties graphene show experimentally k monolayer graphene exfoliated silicon dioxide support still high watts per meter per kelvin near room temperature exceeding metals copper lower suspended graphene phonons leaking across graphene-support interface strong interface-scattering flexural modes make large contribution k suspended graphene according theoretical calculation
