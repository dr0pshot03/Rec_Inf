ultimate speed magnetic switching granular recording media 
magnetic memory devices logical bits recorded selectively setting magnetization vector individual magnetic domains either devices fastest efficient recording method involves precessional switching-: magnetic field b-p applied write pulse period tau magnetization vector precesses field bptau reaches threshold value switching occurs increasing amplitude write pulse b-p might therefore substantially shorten required switching time tau allow faster magnetic recording use short pulses high magnetic field show extreme conditions precessional switching magnetic media supporting high bit densities longer takes place well-defined field strengths instead switching occurs randomly within wide range magnetic fields attribute behaviour momentary collapse ferromagnetic order spins load short high-field pulse thus establishing ultimate limit speed deterministic switching magnetic recording
