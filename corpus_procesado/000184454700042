evolutionary capacitance general feature complex gene networks 
evolutionary capacitor buffers genotypic variation normal conditions thereby promoting accumulation hidden polymorphism occasionally fails thereby revealing variation phenotypically1theprincipal example evolutionary capacitor hsp90 molecular chaperone targets important set signal transduction proteins experiments drosophila arabidopsis demonstrated three key properties hsp90: suppresses phenotypic variation normal conditions releases variation functionally compromised; function overwhelmed environmental stress; exerts pleiotropic effects key developmental processes12 whether properties necessarily make hsp90 significant unique facilitator adaptation1- unclear use numerical simulations complex gene networks well genome-scale expression data yeast single-gene deletion strains present mechanism extends scope evolutionary capacitance beyond action hsp90 alone illustrate perhaps genes reveal phenotypic variation functionally compromised availability loss-of-function mutations accelerates adaptation new optimum phenotype however effect require mutations conditional environment thus might exist large class evolutionary capacitors whose effects phenotypic variation complement systemic environment-induced effects hsp90
