shear-driven dynamo waves high magnetic reynolds number 
astrophysical magnetic fields often display remarkable organization despite generated dynamo action driven turbulent flows high conductivity12 example eleven-year solar cycle shows spatial coherence entire solar surface3- difficulty understanding emergence large-scale organization whereas low conductivity measured magnetic reynolds number rm dynamo fields well organized high rm structure dominated rapidly varying small-scale fluctuations arises smallest scales highest rate strain can amplify magnetic field efficiently therefore effort find flows whose large-scale dynamo properties persist high rm frustrated report high-resolution simulations dynamo can generate organized fields high rm; indeed generation mechanism involves interaction helical flows shear becomes effective large rm shear enhance generation large scales commonly thought; instead reduces generation small scales solution consists propagating dynamo waves whose existence postulated years ago6 since used model solar cycle7
