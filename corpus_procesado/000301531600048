sexual deprivation increases ethanol intake drosophila 
brains reward systems reinforce behaviors required species survival including sex food consumption social interaction drugs abuse co-opt neural pathways can lead addiction used drosophila melanogaster investigate relationship natural drug rewards males mating increased whereas sexual deprivation reduced neuropeptide f npf levels activation inhibition npf system turn reduced enhanced ethanol preference results thus link sexual experience npf system activity ethanol consumption artificial activation npf neurons rewarding precluded ability ethanol act reward propose activity npf-npf receptor axis represents state fly reward system modifies behavior accordingly
