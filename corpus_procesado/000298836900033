antibody-based protection hiv infection vectored immunoprophylaxis
despite tremendous efforts development effective vaccine human immunodeficiency virus hiv proved elusive goal recently however numerous antibodies identified capable neutralizing circulating hiv strains- antibodies exhibit unusually high level somatic mutation presumably owing extensive affinity maturation course continuous exposure evolving antigen although substantial effort focused design immunogens capable eliciting antibodies de novo target similar epitopes- remains uncertain whether conventional vaccine will able elicit analogues existing broadly neutralizing antibodies alternative immunization vector-mediated gene transfer used engineer secretion existing broadly neutralizing antibodies circulation describe practical implementation approach call vectored immunoprophylaxis vip mice induces lifelong expression monoclonal antibodies high concentrations single intramuscular injection achieved using specialized adeno-associated virus vector optimized production full-length antibody muscle tissue show humanized mice receiving vip appear fully protected hiv infection even challenged intravenously high doses replication-competent virus results suggest successful translation approach humans may produce effective prophylaxis hiv
