nuclear organization genome potential gene regulation 
much work published cis-regulatory elements affect gene function locally well biochemistry transcription factors chromatin histone-modifying complexes influence gene expression however surprisingly little information available components organized within three-dimensional space nucleus technological advances now helping identify spatial relationships interactions genes regulatory elements nucleus revealing unexpectedly extensive network communication within chromosomes crucial unresolved issue extent organization affects gene function rather just reflecting
