one polypeptide two aminoacyl-trna synthetase activities
genome sequences certain archaea contain recognizable cysteinyl-transfer rna trna synthetases essential messenger rna-encoded protein synthesis however single cysteinyl-trna synthetase activity detected purified one organism methanococcus jannaschii amino-terminal sequence protein corresponded predicted sequence prolyl-trna synthetase biochemical genetic analyses indicated archaeal form prolyl-trna synthetase can synthesize cysteinyl-trnacys prolyl-trnapro ability one enzyme provide two aminoacyl-trnas protein synthesis raises questions concepts substrate specificity protein synthesis may provide insights evolutionary origins process
