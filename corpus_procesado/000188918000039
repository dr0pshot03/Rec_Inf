improving density jammed disordered packings using ellipsoids
packing problems densely objects can fill volume among ancient persistent problems mathematics science equal spheres recently proved face-centered cubic lattice highest possible packing fraction phipi/root18approximate to0 also well known certain random amorphous jammed packings phiapproximate to0 show experimentally new simulation algorithm ellipsoids can randomly pack densely-up phi spheroids aspect ratio close m&ms candies-and even approach phiapproximate to0 ellipsoids aspect ratios suggest higher density directly related higher number degrees freedom per particle thus larger number particle contacts required mechanically stabilize packing measured number contacts per particle zapproximate to10 spheroids compared zapproximate to6 spheres results implications broad range scientific disciplines including properties granular media ceramics glass formation discrete geometry
