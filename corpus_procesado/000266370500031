hippocampal theta oscillations travelling waves 
theta oscillations clock hippocampal activity awake behaviour rapid eye movement rem sleep oscillations prominent local field potential also reflect subthreshold membrane potential strongly modulate spiking hippocampal neurons prevailing view theta oscillations synchronized throughout hippocampus despite lack conclusive experimental evidence contrast show freely behaving rats theta oscillations area ca1 travelling waves propagate roughly along septotemporal axis hippocampus furthermore find spiking ca1 pyramidal cell layer modulated consistent travelling wave pattern results demonstrate theta oscillations pattern hippocampal activity time also across anatomical space presence travelling waves indicates instantaneous output hippocampus topographically organized represents segment rather point physical space
