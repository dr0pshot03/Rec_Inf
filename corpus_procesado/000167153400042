tcr-induced transmembrane signaling peptide/mhc class ii via associated ig-alpha/beta dimers
previous findings suggest cognate t cell-b cell interactions major histocompatability complex mhc class ii molecules transduce signals leading src-family kinase activation ca2+ mobilization proliferation show antigen stimulation resting b cells induces mhc class molecules associate immunoglobulin ig-alpha /ig-beta cd79a/cd79b heterodimers function signal transducers upon mhc class ii aggregation t cell receptor tcr b cell receptor bcr mhc class ii/ig-alpha /ig-beta distinct complexes yet class it-associated ig-alpha/beta appears derived bcr hence ig-alpha/beta used sequential fashion transduction antigen cognate t cell help signals
