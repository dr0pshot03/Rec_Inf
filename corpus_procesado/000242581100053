active galactic nuclei scaled-up galactic black holes 
long-standing question whether active galactic nuclei agn vary like galactic black hole systems appropriately scaled mass- can determine agn behave cosmological timescales studying brighter much faster varying galactic systems x-ray emission produced close black holes provides one best diagnostics behaviour characteristic timescale potentially tell us mass black hole found x-ray variations agn galactic black holes- whether physically meaningful compare two questioned report correcting variations accretion rate timescales can physically linked revealing accretion process exactly small large black holes strong support linkage comes perhaps surprisingly permitted optical emission lines agn whose widths broad-line agn narrow-emission-line seyfert galaxies correlate strongly characteristic x-ray timescale exactly expected agn black hole masses accretion rates agn really just scaled-up galactic black holes
