large tundra methane burst onset freezing
terrestrial wetland emissions largest single source greenhouse gas methane northern high latitude wetlands contribute significantly overall methane emissions wetlands relative source distribution tropical high latitude wetlands remains uncertain result observed spatial seasonal patterns atmospheric methane concentrations can satisfactorily explained particularly high northern latitudes example late autumn shoulder consistently observed seasonal cycles atmospheric methane high latitude sites sources responsible increased methane concentrations remain uncertain report data set extends hourly methane flux measurements high arctic setting late autumn early winter onset soil freezing find emissions fall low steady level growing season increase significantly freeze period integral emissions freeze period approximately equal amount methane emitted entire summer season three dimensional atmospheric chemistry transport model simulations global atmospheric methane concentrations indicate observed early winter emission burst improves agreement simulated seasonal cycle atmospheric data latitudes north degrees n findings suggest permafrost associated freeze bursts methane emissions tundra regions important far unrecognized component seasonal distribution methane emissions high latitudes
