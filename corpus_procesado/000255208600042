drosophila odorant receptors ligand-gated cyclic-nucleotide-activated cation channels 
worm man many odorant signals perceived binding volatile ligands odorant receptors belong g protein coupled receptor gpcr family couple heterotrimeric g proteins induce camp production second messenger activates cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels depolarize olfactory receptor neuron thus providing signal neuronal processing recent findings however challenged concept odorant signal transduction insects odorant receptors lack sequence similarity gpcrs composed conventional odorant receptors example or22a dimerized ubiquitously expressed chaperone protein or83b drosophila or83b structure akin gpcrs inverted orientation plasma membrane however g proteins expressed insect olfactory receptor neurons olfactory perception modified mutations affecting camp transduction pathway show application odorants mammalian cells co expressing or22a or83b results non selective cation currents activated means ionotropic metabotropic pathway subsequent increase intracellular ca2+ concentration expression or83b alone leads functional ion channels directly responding odorants directly activated intracellular camp cgmp insect odorant receptors thus form ligand gated channels well complexes odorant sensing units cyclic nucleotide activated non selective cation channels thereby provide rapid transient well sensitive prolonged odorant signalling
