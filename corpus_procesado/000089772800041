colloidal ordering phase separation liquid-crystalline continuous phase
binary mixtures exist single phase high temperatures two phases lower temperatures rapid cooling therefore induces phase separation proceeds initial formation small particles subsequent growth coarsening solid liquid media process leads growing particles range sizes eventually separate form macroscopically distinct phase behaviour particular interest systems composed isotropic fluid liquid crystal random distribution liquid-crystal droplets isotropic polymer matrix may give rise interesting electro-optical properties report binary mixture consisting isotropic fluid liquid crystal forming continuous phase fully separate two phases self-organizes highly ordered arrays monodisperse colloidal droplet chains rnd size spatial organization droplets controlled orientational elasticity liquid-crystal phase defects caused droplets exceeding critical size expect approach forming monodisperse spatially ordered droplets liquid crystals will allow controlled design ordered composites may useful rheological optical properties
