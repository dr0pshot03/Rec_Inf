design polymethine dyes large third-order optical nonlinearities loss figures merit
all-optical switching applications require materials large third-order nonlinearities low nonlinear optical losses present design approach involves enhancing real part third-order polarizability gamma cyanine-like molecules incorporation polarizable chalcogen atoms terminal groups controlling molecular length obtain favorable one-and two-photon absorption resonances lead suitably low optical loss appreciable dispersion enhancement real part gamma implemented strategy soluble bisselenopyrylium heptamethine dye exhibits real part gamma exceptionally large throughout wavelength range used telecommunications imaginary part gamma measure nonlinear loss smaller two orders magnitude combination critical enabling low-power high-contrast optical switching
