nmr structure determination larger proteins using backbone-only data 
conventional protein structure determination nuclear magnetic resonance data relies heavily side-chain proton-to-proton distances necessary side-chain resonance assignment however labor intensive prone error show structures can accurately determined without nuclear magnetic resonance nmr information side chains proteins kilodaltons incorporating backbone chemical shifts residual dipolar couplings amide proton distances rosetta protein structure modeling methodology data sparse conventional methods serve guide conformational search toward lowest-energy conformations folding landscape details computed models determined physical chemistry implicit rosetta all-atom energy function new method hindered deuteration required suppress nuclear relaxation processes proteins greater kilodaltons enable routine nmr structure determination larger proteins
