ocean salinities reveal strong global water cycle intensification 
fundamental thermodynamics climate models suggest dry regions will become drier wet regions will become wetter response warming efforts detect long-term response sparse surface observations rainfall evaporation remain ambiguous show ocean salinity patterns express identifiable fingerprint intensifying water cycle -year observed global surface salinity changes combined changes global climate models present robust evidence intensified global water cycle rate +/ % per degree surface warming rate double response projected current-generation climate models suggests substantial % intensification global water cycle will occur future degrees degrees warmer world
