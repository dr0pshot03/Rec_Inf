female bluethroats enhance offspring immunocompetence extra-pair copulations 
female birds frequently copulate extra-pair males adaptive value behaviour poorly understood studies suggested good genes may involved females seek eggs fertilized high-quality males without receiving material benefits nevertheless remains shown genetic benefit passed offspring report nestling bluethroats luscinia svecica sired extra-pair males higher t-cell-mediated immune response maternal half-siblings raised nest difference attributed nestling body mass sex hatching order may effect paternal genotype extra-pair young also immunocompetent paternal half-sibs raised genetic fathers nest indicates additional effect maternal genotype results consistent idea females engage extra-pair copulations obtain compatible viability genes rather good genes per se
