anaphase inactivation spindle checkpoint
spindle checkpoint delays cell cycle progression unfit microtubules attach pair sister chromosomes opposite poles mitotic spindle following sister chromatid separation however checkpoint ignores chromosomes whose kinetochores attached one spindle pole state activates checkpoint prior metaphase demonstrate budding yeast mutual inhibition anaphase-promoting complex apc mps1 essential component checkpoint leads sustained inactivation spindle checkpoint mps1 protein abundance decreases anaphase mps1 target apc furthermore expression mps1 anaphase repression apc anaphase reactivates spindle checkpoint apc-mps1 feedback circuit allows cells irreversibly inactivate checkpoint anaphase
