evolutionary trade-offs pareto optimality geometry phenotype space 
biological systems perform multiple tasks face fundamental trade-off: given phenotype optimal tasks ask trade-offs affect range phenotypes found nature using pareto front concept economics engineering find best-trade-off phenotypes weighted averages archetypes-phenotypes specialized single tasks two tasks phenotypes fall line connecting two archetypes explain linear trait correlations allometric relationships well bacterial gene-expression patterns three tasks phenotypes fall within triangle phenotype space whose vertices archetypes evident morphological studies including darwins finches tasks can inferred measured phenotypes based behavior organisms nearest archetypes
