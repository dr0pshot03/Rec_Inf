long-term maintenance resistance polymorphism diffuse interactions
plant resistance r genes crucial component plant defence pathogens although r genes often fail provide durable resistance agricultural context frequently persist long-lived balanced polymorphisms nature- standard theory explains maintenance polymorphisms balance costs benefits resistance virulence tightly coevolving host-pathogen pair however many plant-pathogen interactions lack specificity whether balanced polymorphisms maintained diffusely interacting species unknown identify naturally interacting r gene effector pair arabidopsis thaliana facultative plant pathogen pseudomonas syringae protein encoded r gene rps5 recognizes avrpphb homologue avrpphb2 exhibits balanced polymorphism maintained million years ref consistent presence ancient balanced polymorphism r gene confers benefit plants infected p syringae carrying avrpphb2 also incurs large cost absence infection rps5 alleles maintained intermediate frequencies populations globally suggesting ubiquitous selection resistance however presence p syringae carrying avrpphb probably insufficient explain rps5 polymorphism first avrpphb homologues occur low frequencies p syringae populations thaliana second avrpphb rarely confers virulence benefit p syringae thaliana instead find evidence selection rps5 involves multiple non-homologous effectors multiple pathogen species results associated model suggest r gene polymorphism thaliana may maintained tightly coupled interaction involving single coevolved r gene effector pair likely stable polymorphism maintained complex diffuse community-wide interactions
