innate versus learned odour processing mouse olfactory bulb
mammalian olfactory system mediates various responses including aversive behaviours spoiled foods fear responses predator odours olfactory bulb glomerulus represents single species odorant receptor single odorant can interact several different receptor species odour information received olfactory epithelium converted topographical map multiple glomeruli activated distinct areas olfactory bulb study odour map interpreted brain generated mutant mice olfactory sensory neurons specific area olfactory epithelium ablated targeted expression diphtheria toxin gene show dorsal-zone-depleted mice dorsal domain olfactory bulb devoid glomerular structures although second-order neurons present vacant areas mutant mice lacked innate responses aversive odorants even though capable detecting conditioned aversion remaining glomeruli results indicate mice aversive information received olfactory bulb separate sets glomeruli dedicated innate learned responses
