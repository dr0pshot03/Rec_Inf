escrt-iii governs aurora b-mediated abscission checkpoint chmp4c 
endosomal sorting complex required transport escrt machinery plays evolutionarily conserved role cytokinetic abscission final step cell division daughter cells physically separated show charged multivesicular body mvb protein 4c chmp4c human escrt-iii subunit involved abscission timing function correlated differential spatiotemporal distribution late stages cytokinesis accordingly chmp4c functioned aurora b-dependent abscission checkpoint prevent premature resolution intercellular chromosome bridges accumulation dna damage chmp4c engaged chromosomal passenger complex cpc via interaction borealin suggested model whereby chmp4c inhibits abscission upon phosphorylation aurora b thus escrt machinery may protect genetic damage coordinating midbody resolution abscission checkpoint
