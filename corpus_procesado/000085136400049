synaptic assembly brain absence neurotransmitter secretion 
brain function requires precisely orchestrated connectivity neurons establishment connections believed require signals secreted outgrowing axons followed synapse formation selected neurons deletion single protein munc18- mice leads complete loss neurotransmitter secretion synaptic vesicles throughout development however prevent normal brain assembly including formation layered structures fiber pathways morphologically defined synapses assembly completed neurons undergo apoptosis leading widespread neurodegeneration thus synaptic connectivity depend neurotransmitter secretion maintenance neurotransmitter secretion probably functions validate already established synaptic connections
