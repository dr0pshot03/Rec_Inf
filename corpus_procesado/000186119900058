brct domain phospho-protein binding domain 
carboxyl-terminal domain brct breast cancer gene brca1 protein evolutionarily conserved module exists large number proteins prokaryotes eukaryotes although brct domain-containing proteins participate dna-damage checkpoint dna-repair pathways function brct domain fully understood show brca1 brct domain directly interacts phosphorylated brca1-associated carboxyl-terminal helicase bach1 specific interaction brca1 phosphorylated bach1 cell cycle regulated required dna damage-induced checkpoint control transition g m phase cell cycle show two brct domains interact respective physiological partners phosphorylation-dependent manner thirteen additional brct domains also preferentially bind phospho-peptides rather nonphosphorylated control peptides data imply brct domain phospho-protein binding domain involved cell cycle control
