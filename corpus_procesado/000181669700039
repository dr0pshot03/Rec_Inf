templating organic semiconductors via self-assembly polymer colloids 
route producing semiconducting polymer blends demonstrated doped pi-conjugated polymer forced three-dimensionally continuous minor phase self-assembly colloidal particles block copolymers resulting cellular morphology can viewed high-internal phase polymeric emulsion compared traditional blending procedures process reduces percolation threshold electrical conductivity factor increases conductivity several orders magnitude simultaneously improves thermal stability following route new applications can envisaged semiconducting polymer blends require minimal concentrations doped pi-conjugated polymer
