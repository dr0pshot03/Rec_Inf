reshaping conformational search protein chaperone trigger factor
protein folding often described search process polypeptides explore different conformations find native structure molecular chaperones known improve folding yields suppressing aggregation polypeptides conformational search starts well rescuing misfolds ends although chaperones long speculated also affect conformational search itself-by reshaping underlying folding landscape along folding trajectory-direct experimental evidence scarce far escherichia coli general chaperone trigger factor- tf play role tf shown interact nascent chains ribosome polypeptides released ribosome cytosol fully folded proteins assembly larger complexes investigate effect tf e coli conformational search polypeptides native state investigated individual maltose binding protein mbp molecules using optical tweezers show tf binds folded structures smaller one domain stable seconds ultimately convert native state moreover tf stimulates native folding constructs repeated mbp domains results indicate tf promotes correct folding protecting partially folded states distant interactions produce stable misfolded states tf interacts newly synthesized proteins e coli expect findings general importance understanding protein folding pathways
