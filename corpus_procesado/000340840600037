comparative analysis transcriptome across distant species 
transcriptome readout genome identifying common features across distant species can reveal fundamental principles end encode modencode consortia generated large amounts matched rna-sequencing data human worm fly uniform processing comprehensive annotation data allow comparison across metazoan phyla extending beyond earlier within-phylum transcriptome comparisons revealing ancient conserved features1- specifically discover co-expression modules shared across animals many enriched developmental genes moreover use expression patterns align stages worm fly development find novel pairing worm embryo fly pupae addition embryo-to-embryo larvae-to-larvae pairings furthermore find extent non-canonical non-coding transcription similar organism per base pair finally find three organisms gene-expression levels coding non-coding can quantitatively predicted chromatin features promoter using universal model based single set organism-independent parameters
