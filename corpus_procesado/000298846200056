molecular mimicry regulates aba signaling snrk2 kinases pp2c phosphatases
abscisic acid aba essential hormone plants survive environmental stresses center aba signaling network subfamily type 2c protein phosphatases pp2cs form exclusive interactions aba receptors subfamily snfl-related kinase snrk2s report snrk2-pp2c complex structure reveals marked similarity pp2c recognition snrk2 aba receptors complex kinase activation loop docks active site pp2c conserved aba-sensing tryptophan pp2c inserts kinase catalytic cleft thus mimicking receptor-pp2c interactions structural results provide simple mechanism directly couples aba binding snrk2 kinase activation highlight new paradigm kinase-phosphatase regulation mutual packing catalytic sites
