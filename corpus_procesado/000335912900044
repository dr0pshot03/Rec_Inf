sulfur oxidation genes diverse deep-sea viruses
viruses abundant biological entities oceans pervasive cause mortality microorganisms drive biogeochemical cycles although ecological evolutionary effects viruses marine phototrophs well recognized little known impact ubiquitous marine lithotrophs report genome sequences double-stranded dna viruses putatively infect widespread sulfur-oxidizing bacteria fifteen viral genomes contain auxiliary metabolic genes alpha gamma subunits reverse dissimilatory sulfite reductase rdsr enzyme oxidizes elemental sulfur abundant hydrothermal plumes studied findings implicate viruses key agent sulfur cycle reservoir genetic diversity bacterial enzymes underpin chemosynthesis deep oceans
