systemic leukocyte-directed sirna delivery revealing cyclin d1 anti-inflammatory target 
cyclin d1 cyd1 pivotal cell cycle regulatory molecule well studied therapeutic target cancer although cyd1 also strongly regulated sites inflammation exact roles context remain uncharacterized address question developed strategy selectively silencing cyd1 leukocytes vivo targeted stabilized nanoparticles tsnps loaded cyd1 small interfering rna sirna antibodies beta integrin beta used target specific leukocyte subsets involved gut inflammation systemic application beta i-tsnps silenced cyd1 leukocytes reversed experimentally induced colitis mice suppressing leukocyte proliferation t helper cell cytokine expression study reveals cyd1 potential anti inflammatory target suggests application similar modes targeting sirna may feasible therapeutic settings
