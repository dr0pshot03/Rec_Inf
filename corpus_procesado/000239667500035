netrins promote developmental therapeutic angiogenesis
axonal guidance vascular patterning share several guidance cues including proteins netrin family demonstrate netrins stimulate proliferation migration tube formation human endothelial cells vitro stimulation independent known netrin receptors suppression netrin1a messenger rna zebrafish inhibits vascular sprouting implying proangiogenic rote netrins vertebrate development also show netrins accelerate neovascularization vivo model ischemia reverse neuropathy vasculopathy diabetic murine model propose attractive vascular neural guidance functions netrins offer unique therapeutic potential
