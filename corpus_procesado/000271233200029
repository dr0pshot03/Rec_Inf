high-temperature superconductivity single copper-oxygen plane 
question thin cuprate layers can still retaining high-temperature superconductivity hts challenging address part experimental studies require synthesis near-perfect ultrathin hts layers ways profile superconducting properties critical temperature superfluid density across interfaces atomic resolution used atomic-layer molecular beam epitaxy synthesize bilayers cuprate metal la165sr045cuo4 cuprate insulator la2cuo4 layer just three unit cells thick selectively doped layers isovalent zn atoms suppress superconductivity act markers show interface hts occurs within single cuo2 plane approach may also useful fabricating hts devices
