sos response promotes horizontal dissemination antibiotic resistance genes 
mobile genetic elements crucial role spreading antibiotic resistance genes among bacterial populations environmental genetic factors regulate conjugative transfer antibiotic resistance genes bacterial populations largely unknown integrating conjugative elements ices diverse group mobile elements transferred means cell-cell contact integrate chromosome new host sxt similar to100-kilobase ice derived vibrio cholerae encodes genes confer resistance chloramphenicol sulphamethoxazole trimethoprim streptomycin sxt-related elements detected v cholerae now present almost clinical v cholerae isolates asia ices related sxt also present several bacterial species encode variety antibiotic heavy metal resistance genes- show setr sxt encoded repressor represses expression activators sxt transfer sos response dna damage alleviates repression increasing expression genes necessary sxt transfer hence frequency transfer sos induced variety environmental factors antibiotics example ciprofloxacin show ciprofloxacin induces sxt transfer well thus present mechanism therapeutic agents can promote spread antibiotic resistance genes
