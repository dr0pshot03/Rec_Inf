genetic variant bdnf polymorphism alters extinction learning mouse human 
mouse models useful studying genes involved behavior whether relevant human behavior unclear identified parallel phenotypes mice humans resulting common single-nucleotide polymorphism brain-derived neurotrophic factor bdnf gene involved anxiety-related behavior inbred genetic knock-in mouse strain expressing variant bdnf recapitulated phenotypic effects human polymorphism impaired extinguishing conditioned fear response paralleled atypical frontoamygdala activity humans thus variant bdnf allele may play role anxiety disorders showing impaired learning cues signal safety versus threat efficacy treatments rely extinction mechanisms exposure therapy
