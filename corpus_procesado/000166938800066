integration telomere sequences draft human genome sequence 
telomeres ends linear eukaryotic chromosomes ensure large stretches uncharacterized dna remain ends human working draft sequence ends chromosome need connect sequences telomeres working draft sequence telomeres unusual dna sequence composition organization makes particularly difficult isolate analyse use specialized linear yeast artificial chromosome clones carrying large telomere-terminal fragment human dna integrate human telomeres working draft sequence subtelomeric sequence structure appears vary widely mainly result large differences subtelomeric repeat sequence abundance organization individual telomeres many subtelomeric regions appear gene-rich matching known unknown expressed genes indicates human subtelomeric regions simply buffers nonfunctional junk dna next molecular telomere instead functional parts expressed genome
