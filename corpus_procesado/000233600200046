wingless signaling synapses cleavage nuclear import receptor dfrizzled2 
wingless secretion provides pivotal signals development activating transcription target genes drosophila synapses wingless secreted presynaptic terminals required synaptic growth differentiation wingless binds seven-pass transmembrane dfrizzled2 receptor ensuing events synapses known show dfrizzled2 endocytosed postsynaptic membrane transported nucleus c terminus dfrizzled2 cleaved translocated nucleus; n-terminal region remains just outside nucleus translocation dfrizzled2-c nucleus cleavage transport depends wingless signaling conclude synapses wingless signal transduction occurs nuclear localization dfrizzled2-c potential transcriptional regulation synapse development
