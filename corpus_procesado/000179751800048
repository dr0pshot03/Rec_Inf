hiv evades antibody-mediated neutralization conformational masking receptor-binding sites
ability human immunodeficiency virus hiv- persist cause aids dependent avoidance antibody-mediated neutralization virus elicits abundant envelope-directed antibodies little neutralization capacity lack neutralization paradoxical given functional conservation exposure receptor-binding sites gp120 envelope glycoprotein larger typical antibody footprint therefore accessible antibody binding gp120-receptor interactions involve conformational reorganization measured entropies binding gp120-reactive antibodies show recognition receptor-binding-site antibodies induces conformational change correlation neutralization potency analysis receptor-antibody thermodynamic cycles suggested receptor-binding-site conformational masking mechanism neutralization escape understand escape mechanism compatible virus-receptor interactions tested soluble dodecameric receptor molecule found neutralized primary hiv isolates great potency showing simultaneous binding viral envelope glycoproteins multiple receptors creates sufficient avidity compensate masking solution available cell-surface receptors antibodies conformational masking enables hiv maintain receptor binding simultaneously resist neutralization
