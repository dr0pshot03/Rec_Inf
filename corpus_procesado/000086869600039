direct targeting light signals promoter element-bound transcription factor
light signals perceived phytochrome family sensory photoreceptors transduced photoresponsive genes unknown mechanism show basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor pif3 binds specifically g-box dna-sequence motif present various light-regulated gene promoters phytochrome b binds reversibly g-box-bound pif3 specifically upon light-triggered conversion photoreceptor biologically active conformer suggest phytochromes may function integral light-switchable components transcriptional regulator complexes permitting continuous immediate sensing changes environmental signal directly target gene promoters
