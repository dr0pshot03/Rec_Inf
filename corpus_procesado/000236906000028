low level extragalactic background light revealed gamma-rays blazars
diffuse extragalactic background light consists sum starlight emitted galaxies history universe also important contribution first stars may formed galaxy formation began direct measurements difficult yet conclusive owing large uncertainties caused bright foreground emission associated zodiacal light alternative approach- study absorption features imprinted gamma-ray spectra distant extragalactic objects interactions photons background light photons report discovery gamma-ray emission blazars h 1es redshifts z z respectively unexpectedly hard spectra provide upper limit background light optical/near-infrared wavelengths appears close lower limit given integrated light resolved galaxies background flux wavelengths accordingly seems strongly dominated direct starlight galaxies thus excluding large contribution sources-in particular first stars formed result also indicates intergalactic space transparent gamma-rays previously thought
