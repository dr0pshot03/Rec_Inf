electron-hole symmetry semiconducting carbon nanotube quantum dot 
optical electronic phenomena solids arise behaviour electrons holes unoccupied states filled electron sea electron-hole symmetry can often invoked simplifying description states electrons energy fermi sea behave holes fermi energy semiconductors however electron-hole symmetry generally absent energy-band structure conduction band differs valence band report measurements discrete quantized-energy spectrum electrons holes semiconducting carbon nanotube applying voltage gate electrode individual nanotube filled controllably precise number either electrons holes starting one discrete excitation spectrum nanotube n holes strikingly similar corresponding spectrum n electrons observation near-perfect electron-hole symmetry demonstrates semiconducting nanotube can free charged impurities even limit electrons holes furthermore find anomalously small zeeman spin splitting excitation spectrum indicating strong electron-electron interactions
