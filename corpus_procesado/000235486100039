discovery two new satellites pluto 
plutos first known satellite charon discovered diameter similar km half pluto- makes larger relative primary moon solar system previous searches satellites around pluto unsuccessful- sensitive objects less similar km diameter fundamental reasons pluto satellites report discovery two additional moons around pluto provisionally designated s/ p1 hereafter p1 s/ p2 hereafter p2 makes pluto first kuiper belt object known multiple satellites new satellites much smaller charon estimates p1s diameter ranging km km depending surface reflectivity p2 per cent smaller p1 although definitive orbits derived new satellites appear moving circular orbits orbital plane charon orbital periods similar days p1 similar days p2
