molecular engineering backwards-moving myosin motor
members diverse myosin superfamily highly conserved globular motor domain contains actin nucleotide-binding sites produces force movement light-chain-binding domain connects motor domain variety functionally specialized tail domains amplifies small structural changes motor domain rotation lever arm myosins move polarized actin filaments either forwards barbed backwards pointed end describe engineering artificial backwards-moving myosin three pre-existing molecular building blocks blocks are: forward-moving class myosin motor domain directional inverter formed four-helix bundle segment human guanylate-binding protein artificial lever arm formed two alpha-actinin repeats results prove reverse-direction movement myosins can achieved simply rotating direction lever arm 180degrees
