analytic algorithmic solution random satisfiability problems 
study satisfiability random boolean expressions built many clauses k variables per clause k-satisfiability expressions ratio alpha clauses variables less threshold alphac almost always satisfiable whereas ratio threshold almost always unsatisfiable show existence intermediate phase alphac proliferation metastable states responsible onset complexity search algorithms introduce class optimization algorithms can deal metastable states; one algorithm tested successfully largest existing benchmark k-satisfiability
