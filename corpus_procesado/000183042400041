ferroelectricity free niobium clusters
electric deflections gas-phase cryogenically cooled neutral niobium clusters [nb-n number atoms n temperature t kelvin] measured molecular beams show cold clusters may attain anomalous component large electric dipole moments contrast room temperature measurements show normal metallic polarizabilities characteristic energies kbtgn [boltzmann constant kb times transition temperature t-gn] identified ferroelectric-like state develops generally t-g decreases [ > t-gn > k] n increases pronounced even-odd alternations n > new state metallic matter may related bulk superconductivity
