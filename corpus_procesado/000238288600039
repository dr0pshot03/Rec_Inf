measurement forces inside three-dimensional pile frictionless droplets
present systematic detailed measurements interparticle contact forces inside three-dimensional piles frictionless liquid droplets measured long-range chainlike correlations directions magnitudes large forces thereby establishing presence force chains three dimensions correlation definition provides chain persistence length mean droplet diameters decreasing load applied pile also measured angles contacts showed chainlike arrangement arises balance forces moreover found piles whose height comparable chain persistence length exhibited substantially greater strain hardening tall piles attributed force chains together results establish connection microscopic force network elastic response meso macroscopic granular piles conclusions drawn relevant jammed systems generally including concentrated emulsions piles sand heavy particles
