sted microscopy reveals synaptotagmin remains clustered synaptic vesicle exocytosis
synaptic transmission mediated neurotransmitters stored synaptic vesicles released exocytosis upon activation vesicle membrane retrieved endocytosis synaptic vesicles regenerated re-filled neurotransmitter although many aspects vesicle recycling understood fate vesicles fusion still unclear components diffuse plasma membrane remain together question difficult answer synaptic vesicles small similar nm diameter densely packed resolved available fluorescence microscopes use stimulated emission depletion sted reduce focal spot area order magnitude diffraction limit thereby resolving individual vesicles synapse show synaptotagmin protein resident vesicle membrane remains clustered isolated patches presynaptic membrane regardless whether nerve terminals mildly active intensely stimulated suggests least vesicle constituents remain together recycling study also demonstrates questions involving cellular structures dimensions tens nanometres can resolved conventional far-field optics visible light
