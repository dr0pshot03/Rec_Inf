genetic determinants cellular constraints noisy gene expression
individual cells transcription random process obeying single-molecule kinetics often occurs bursty intermittent manner frequency size bursts affect magnitude temporal fluctuations messenger rna protein content within cell creating variation noise gene expression still unclear degree transcriptional kinetics specific gene determined promoter sequence alternative scenarios proposed kinetics transcription governed cellular constraints follow universal rules across genome evidence genome-wide noise studies systematic perturbations promoter sequences suggest scenarios-namely gene-specific versus genome-wide regulation transcription kinetics-may present different degrees bacteria yeast animal cells
