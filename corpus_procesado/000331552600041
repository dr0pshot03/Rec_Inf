artificial muscles fishing line sewing thread
high cost powerful large-stroke high-stress artificial muscles combined performance limitations low cycle life hysteresis low efficiency restrict applications demonstrated inexpensive high-strength polymer fibers used fishing line sewing thread can easily transformed twist insertion provide fast scalable nonhysteretic long-life tensile torsional muscles extreme twisting produces coiled muscles can contract % lift loads times heavier can human muscle length weight generate kilowatts mechanical work per kilogram muscle weight similar produced jet engine woven textiles change porosity response temperature actuating window shutters help conserve energy also demonstrated large-stroke tensile actuation theoretically experimentally shown result torsional actuation
