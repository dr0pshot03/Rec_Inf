commensal bacteria control cancer response therapy modulating tumor microenvironment
gut microbiota influences local systemic inflammation inflammation contributes development progression treatment cancer remains unclear whether commensal bacteria affect inflammation sterile tumor microenvironment show disruption microbiota impairs response subcutaneous tumors cpg-oligonucleotide immunotherapy platinum chemotherapy antibiotics-treated germ-free mice tumor-infiltrating myeloid-derived cells responded poorly therapy resulting lower cytokine production tumor necrosis cpg-oligonucleotide treatment deficient production reactive oxygen species cytotoxicity chemotherapy thus optimal responses cancer therapy require intact commensal microbiota mediates effects modulating myeloid-derived cell functions tumor microenvironment findings underscore importance microbiota outcome disease treatment
