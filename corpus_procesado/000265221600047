mirror neurons differentially encode peripersonal extrapersonal space monkeys 
actions performed others may different relevance observer thus lead different behavioral responses depending regions space executed found rhesus monkeys premotor cortex neurons activated execution observation motor acts mirror neurons differentially modulated location space observed motor acts relative monkey half preferring either monkeys peripersonal extrapersonal space portion spatially selective mirror neurons encode space according metric representation whereas neurons encode space operational terms changing properties according possibility monkey will interact object results suggest set mirror neurons encodes observed motor acts action understanding also analyze acts terms features relevant generating appropriate behaviors
