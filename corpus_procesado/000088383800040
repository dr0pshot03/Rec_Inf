signatures granular microstructure dense shear flows
granular materials ordinary fluids react differently shear stresses rather deforming uniformly materials dry sand cohesionless powders develop shear bands--narrow zones large relative particle motion essentially rigid adjacent regions shear bands mark areas flow material failure energy dissipation important many industrial civil engineering geophysical processes also relevant lubricating fluids confined ultrathin molecular layers however detailed three-dimensional information motion within shear band including degree particle rotation interparticle slip lacking similarly little known microstructure individual grains affects movement densely packed material combine magnetic resonance imaging x-ray tomography high-speed-video particle tracking obtain local steady-state particle velocity rotation packing density shear flow three-dimensional couette geometry find key characteristics granular microstructure determine shape velocity profile
