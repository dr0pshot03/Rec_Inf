nuclear dna sequences detect species limits ancient moa 
ancient dna studies typically used multi-copy mitochondrial dna sequences largely single-locus nuclear genes difficult recover sub-fossil material restricting scope ancient dna research isolated single-locus nuclear dna markers assign sex extinct moa combination mitochondrial dna phylogeny tested competing hypotheses specific status moa taxa moa large ratite birds showed extreme size variation within among species taxa large variation hypothesized represent sexual dimorphism others argued reflect existence different species results show moa characterized extreme reverse sexual dimorphism result able clarify number moa species example show three recognized species dinornis comprised two monophyletic groups two species comprised individuals one sex study also illustrates single-locus nuclear dna sequences can consistently recovered ancient material
