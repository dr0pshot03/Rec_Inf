conductance single conjugated polymer continuous function length 
development electronic devices single-molecule scale requires detailed understanding charge transport individual molecular wires characterize electrical conductance necessary vary length single molecular wire contacted two electrodes controlled way studies usually determine conductance certain molecular species one specific length measure conductance mechanical characteristics single polyfluorene wire pulling au111 surface tip scanning tunneling microscope thus continuously changing length nanometers conductance curves show exponential decay also characteristic oscillations one molecular unit another detached surface stretching
