neural representations location composed spatially periodic bands 
mammalian hippocampal formation provides neuronal representations environmental location underlying mechanisms poorly understood report class cells whose spatially periodic firing patterns composed plane waves bands drawn discrete set orientations wavelengths majority cells recorded parasubicular medial entorhinal cortices freely moving rats belonged class included grid cells important subset corresponds three bands orientations stable firing pattern occasional changes hexagonal nonhexagonal patterns imply common underlying mechanism results indicate fourier-like spatial analysis underlying neuronal representations location suggest path integration performed integrating displacement along restricted set directions
