dynamic marine calcium cycle past million years
multiple lines evidence shown isotopic composition concentration calcium seawater changed past million years high resolution continuous seawater calcium isotope ratio curve marine pelagic barite reveals distinct features evolution seawater calcium isotopic ratio suggesting changes seawater calcium concentrations pronounced increase delta/ca value seawater per mil occurred roughly million years following period low values around million years ago major change marine calcium corresponds climatic transition global change carbon cycle suggests reorganization global biogeochemical system
