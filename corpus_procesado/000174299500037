repeated sudden reversals dipole field generated spherical dynamo action
using long-duration three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulation found magnetic dipole field generated dynamo action rotating spherical shell repeatedly reverses polarity irregular intervals punctuated reversal although total convection energy magnetic energy alternate high-energy state low-energy state dipole polarity can reverse high-energy states north-south symmetry convection pattern broken columnar vortex structure becomes vulnerable another attractive finding quadrupole mode grows exceeding dipole mode reversal may help explain earths magnetic field reverses
