cardiac myosin activation: potential therapeutic approach systolic heart failure 
decreased cardiac contractility central feature systolic heart failure existing drugs increase cardiac contractility indirectly signaling cascades limited mechanism-related adverse effects avoid limitations previously developed omecamtiv mecarbil small-molecule direct activator cardiac myosin show binds myosin catalytic domain operates allosteric mechanism increase transition rate myosin strongly actin-bound force-generating state paradoxically inhibits adenosine -triphosphate turnover absence actin suggests stabilizes actin-bound conformation myosin animal models omecamtiv mecarbil increases cardiac function increasing duration ejection without changing rates contraction cardiac myosin activation may provide new therapeutic approach systolic heart failure
