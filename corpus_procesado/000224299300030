surface mechanics mediate pattern formation developing retina 
pattern formation biological structures involves organizing different types cells spatial configuration study investigate physical basis biological patterning drosophila retina vivo demonstrate e n-cadherins mediate apical adhesion retina epithelial cells differential expression n-cadherin within sub-group retinal cells cone cells causes form overall shape minimizes surface contact surrounding cells cells within group normal experimentally manipulated conditions pack together way soap bubbles shaping cone cell group packing components precisely imitate physical tendency surfaces minimized thus simple patterned expression n-cadherin results complex spatial pattern cells owing cellular surface mechanics
