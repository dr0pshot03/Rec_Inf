error attack tolerance complex networks 
many complex systems display surprising degree tolerance errors example relatively simple organisms grow persist reproduce despite drastic pharmaceutical environmental interventions error tolerance attributed robustness underlying metabolic network1 complex communication networks2 display surprising degree robustness: although key components regularly malfunction local failures rarely lead loss global information-carrying ability network stability complex systems often attributed redundant wiring functional web defined systems components demonstrate error tolerance shared redundant systems: displayed class inhomogeneously wired networks called scale-free networks include world-wide web3- internet6 social networks7 cells8 find networks display unexpected degree robustness ability nodes communicate unaffected even unrealistically high failure rates however error tolerance comes high price networks extremely vulnerable attacks selection removal nodes play vital role maintaining networks connectivity error tolerance attack vulnerability generic properties communication networks
