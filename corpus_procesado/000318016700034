neurotransmitter switching adult brain regulates behavior
neurotransmitters thought fixed throughout life whether sensory stimuli alter behaviorally relevant transmitter expression mature brain unknown found populations interneurons adult rat hypothalamus switched dopamine somatostatin expression response exposure short long-day photoperiods changes postsynaptic dopamine receptor expression matched changes presynaptic dopamine whereas somatostatin receptor expression remained constant pharmacological blockade ablation dopaminergic neurons led anxious depressed behavior phenocopying performance exposure long-day photoperiod induction newly dopaminergic neurons exposure short-day photoperiod rescued behavioral consequences lesions natural stimulation sensory modalities may cause changes transmitter expression regulate different behaviors
