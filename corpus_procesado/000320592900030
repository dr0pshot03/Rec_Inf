anisotropic leaky-mode modulator holographic video displays
every holographic video display built spatial light modulator directs light diffraction form points three-dimensional space modulators currently used holographic video displays challenging use several reasons: relatively low bandwidth high cost low diffraction angle poor scalability presence quantization noise unwanted diffractive orders zero-order light present modulators holographic video displays based anisotropic leaky-mode couplers potential address challenges modulators can fabricated simply monolithically low cost additionally modulators capable new functionalities wavelength division multiplexing colour display demonstrate three enabling properties particular interest-polarization rotation enlarged angular diffraction frequency domain colour filtering-and suggest technology can used platform low-cost high-performance holographic video displays
