deconstructing transcriptional heterogeneity pluripotent stem cells 
pluripotent stem cells pscs capable dynamic interconversion distinct substates however regulatory circuits specifying states enabling transitions well understood set characterize transcriptional heterogeneity mouse pscs single-cell expression profiling different chemical genetic perturbations signalling factors developmental regulators show highly variable expression expression states variable genes heritable multiple cell divisions expression variability population heterogeneity can influenced perturbation signalling pathways chromatin regulators notably either removal mature micrornas pharmacological blockage signalling pathways drives pscs low-noise ground state characterized reconfigured pluripotency network enhanced self-renewal distinct chromatin state effect mediated opposing microrna families acting myc/lin28/let axis data provide insight nature transcriptional heterogeneity pscs
