observation large water-cluster anions surface-bound excess electrons 
anionic water clusters long studied infer properties bulk hydrated electron used photoelectron imaging characterize class h2on- d2on- cluster anions n less equal molecules vertical binding energies significantly lower previously recorded data consistent structure excess electron bound surface cluster result implies excess electron previously observed water-cluster anions higher vertical binding energies internally solvated thus properties clusters extrapolated bulk hydrated electron
