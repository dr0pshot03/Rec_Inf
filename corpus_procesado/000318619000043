compartmentalization gabaergic inhibition dendritic spines
gamma-aminobutyric acid-mediated gabaergic inhibition plays critical role shaping neuronal activity neocortex numerous experimental investigations examined perisomatic inhibitory synapses control action potential output pyramidal neurons however inhibitory synapses neocortex formed onto pyramidal cell dendrites theoretical studies suggest may focally regulate cellular activity precision gabaergic control dendritic electrical biochemical signaling unknown using cell type-specific optical stimulation combination two-photon calcium ca2+ imaging show somatostatin-expressing interneurons exert compartmentalized control postsynaptic ca2+ signals within individual dendritic spines highly focal inhibitory action mediated subset gabaergic synapses directly target spine heads gabaergic inhibition thus participates localized control dendritic electrical biochemical signaling
