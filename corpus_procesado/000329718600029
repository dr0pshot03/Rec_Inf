single-crystal linear polymers visible light-triggered topochemical quantitative polymerization
one challenges polymer science prepare large-polymer single crystals demonstrate visible light-triggered quantitative topochemical polymerization reaction based conjugated dye molecule macroscopic-size high-quality polymer single crystals obtained polymerization limited single crystals can also achieved highly concentrated solution semicrystalline thin films addition show polymer decomposes monomer upon thermolysis indicates polymerization-depolymerization process reversible physical properties polymer crystals enable us isolate single-polymer strands via mechanical exfoliation makes possible study individual long polymer chains
