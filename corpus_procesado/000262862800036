control graphenes properties reversible hydrogenation: evidence graphane
although graphite known one chemically inert materials found graphene single atomic plane graphite can react atomic hydrogen transforms highly conductive zero overlap semimetal insulator transmission electron microscopy reveals obtained graphene derivative graphane crystalline retains hexagonal lattice period becomes markedly shorter graphene reaction hydrogen reversible original metallic state lattice spacing even quantum hall effect can restored annealing work illustrates concept graphene robust atomic scale scaffold basis new two dimensional crystals designed electronic properties can created attaching atoms molecules
