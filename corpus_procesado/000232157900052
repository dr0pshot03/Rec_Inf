meniscus-climbing insects 
water-walking insects spiders rely surface tension static weight support12 use variety means propel along surface3- pass water surface land must contend slippery slopes menisci border waters edge ability climb menisci skill exploited water-walking insects seek land order lay eggs avoid predators4; moreover necessary adaptation ancestors evolved terrestrials live exclusively water surface3 many millimetre-scale water-walking insects unable climb menisci using traditional means propulsion239 combined experimental theoretical study investigate meniscus-climbing technique insects use assuming fixed body posture deform water surface order generate capillary forces10-: thus propel laterally without moving appendages develop theoretical model novel mode propulsion use rationalize climbers characteristic body postures predict climbing trajectories consistent reported elsewhere3
