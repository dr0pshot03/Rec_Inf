developmentally regulated pirna clusters implicate mili transposon control
nearly half mammalian genome composed repeated sequences drosophila piwi proteins exert control transposons however mammalian piwi proteins miwi mili partner piwi-interacting rnas pirnas depleted repeat sequences raises questions role mammalian piwis transposon control search murine small rnas might program piwi proteins transposon suppression revealed developmentally regulated pirna loci resemble transposon master control loci drosophila also find evidence adaptive amplification loop mili catalyzes formation pirna ends mili mutants derepress line l1 intracisternal particle lose dna methylation l1 elements demonstrating evolutionarily conserved role piwi proteins transposon suppression
