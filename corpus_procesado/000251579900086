coevolution viruses drives evolution bacterial mutation rates 
bacteria greatly elevated mutation rates mutators frequently found natural- laboratory populations often associated clinical infections although mutators may increase adaptability novel environmental conditions also prone accumulation deleterious mutations long-term maintenance high bacterial mutation rates therefore likely driven rapidly changing selection pressures- addition possible slow transition rate point mutation mutators non mutators one likely causes rapidly changing selection pressures antagonistic coevolution parasites show whether coevolution viral parasites drive evolution bacterial mutation rates laboratory populations bacterium pseudomonas fluorescens fewer bacterial generations % populations coevolving phages evolved fold increases mutation rates owing mutations mismatch-repair genes populations evolving absence phages showed significant change mutation rate furthermore mutator populations higher probability driving phage populations extinct strongly suggesting mutators advantage phages coevolutionary arms race given ubiquity bacteriophages may play important role evolution bacterial mutation rates
