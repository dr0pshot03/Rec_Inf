synaptic potentiation onto habenula neurons learned helplessness model depression
cellular basis depressive disorders poorly understood recent studies monkeys indicate neurons lateral habenula lhb nucleus mediates communication forebrain midbrain structures can increase activity animal fails receive expected positive reward receives stimulus predicts aversive conditions disappointment anticipation negative outcome- lhb neurons project modulate dopamine-rich regions ventral tegmental area vta control reward-seeking behaviour participate depressive disorders show two learned helplessness models depression excitatory synapses onto lhb neurons projecting vta potentiated synaptic potentiation correlates animals helplessness behaviour due enhanced presynaptic release probability depleting transmitter release repeated electrical stimulation lhb afferents using protocol can effective patients depressed markedly suppresses synaptic drive onto vta-projecting lhb neurons brain slices can significantly reduce learned helplessness behaviour rats results indicate increased presynaptic action onto lhb neurons contributes rodent learned helplessness model depression
