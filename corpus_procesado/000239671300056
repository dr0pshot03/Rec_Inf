experimental study coloring problem human subject networks 
theoretical work suggests structural properties naturally occurring networks important shaping behavior dynamics however relationships structure behavior difficult establish empirical studies networks studies typically fixed studied networks human subjects attempting solve graph network coloring problem models settings desirable distinguish ones behavior ones network neighbors networks generated preferential attachment made solving coloring problem difficult networks based cyclical structures small worlds networks easier still also showed providing information can opposite effects performance depending network structure
