angular momentum conservation dipolar energy transfer 
conservation angular momentum familiar tenet science seldom invoked understand predict chemical processes developed general formalism based wigners original ideas concerning angular momentum conservation interpret photo-induced reactivity two molecular donor-acceptor assemblies physical properties synthetically tailored facilitate intramolecular energy transfer steady-state time-resolved spectroscopic data establishing excited-state energy transfer rheniumi-based charge-transfer state chromiumiii acceptor can fully accounted forster theory whereas corresponding cobaltiii adduct undergo analogous reaction despite larger cross-section dipolar coupling pronounced difference reactivity easily explained within context angular momentum conservation model relatively simple construct may provide means systematizing broad range chemical reactions
