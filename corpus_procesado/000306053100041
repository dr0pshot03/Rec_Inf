eddy-driven stratification initiates north atlantic spring phytoplankton blooms
springtime phytoplankton blooms photosynthetically fix carbon export surface ocean globally important rates blooms triggered increased light exposure phytoplankton due seasonal light increase development near-surface vertical density gradient stratification inhibits vertical mixing phytoplankton classically current climate models stratification ascribed springtime warming sea surface using observations subpolar north atlantic three-dimensional biophysical model show initial stratification resulting bloom instead caused eddy-driven slumping basin-scale north-south density gradient resulting patchy bloom beginning days earlier occur warming
