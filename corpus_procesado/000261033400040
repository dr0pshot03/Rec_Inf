selfish genetic elements promote polyandry fly
unknown females mate multiple males mating frequently costly single copulation often provides enough sperm fertilize females eggs one possibility remating increases fitness offspring fertilization success biased toward sperm high fitness males show female drosophila pseudoobscura evolved increased remating rates exposed risk mating males carrying deleterious sex ratio distorting gene also reduces sperm competitive ability selfish genetic elements reduce sperm competitive ability generally associated low genetic fitness may represent common driver evolution polyandry
