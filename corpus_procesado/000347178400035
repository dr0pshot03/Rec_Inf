observation quantized conductance neutral matter 
transport experiments quantum nature matter becomes directly evident changes conductance occur discrete steps size determined solely plancks constant h observations quantized steps electrical conductance provided important insights physics mesoscopic systems allowed development quantum electronic devices even though quantized conductance rely presence electric charges never observed neutral massive particles fundamental form requires quantum-degenerate fermi gas ballistic adiabatic transport channel constriction dimensions comparable fermi wavelength report observation quantized conductance transport neutral atoms driven chemical potential bias atoms ultra-ballistic regime mean free path exceeds size transport channel also size entire system including atom reservoirs use high-resolution lithography shape light potentials realize either quantum point contact quantum wire atoms constrictions imprinted quasi-two-dimensional ballistic channel connecting reservoirs varying either gate potential transverse confinement constrictions observe distinct plateaux atom conductance conductance first plateau found equal universal conductance quantum /h use landauers formula model results find good agreement low gate potentials parameters determined priori experiment lets us investigate quantum conductors wide control channel geometry also reservoir properties interaction strength size thermalization rate
