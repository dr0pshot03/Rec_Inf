infall gas formation mechanism stars times massive sun
theory predicts observations confirm low-mass stars like sun early life grow accreting gas surrounding material stars similar times massive sun similar 10m powerful stellar radiation expected inhibit accretion1 thus limit growth mass clearly stars masses > 10m exist must way form problem may solved non-spherical accretion allows stellar photons escape along symmetry axis density lower recent detection rotating disks- toroids around young massive stars lent support idea high mass greater similar 8m stars formin way report observations ammonia line towards high mass star forming region conclude gas falling inwards towards young star similar 20m line theoretical predictions non-spherical accretion
