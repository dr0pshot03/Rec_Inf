ancient biomolecules deep ice cores reveal forested southern greenland
difficult obtain fossil data % earths terrestrial surface covered thick glaciers ice sheets hence knowledge paleoenvironments regions remained limited show dna amino acids buried organisms can recovered basal sections deep ice cores enabling reconstructions past flora fauna show high-altitude southern greenland currently lying kilometers ice inhabited diverse array conifer trees insects within past million years results provide direct evidence support forested southern greenland suggest many deep ice cores may contain genetic records paleoenvironments basal sections
