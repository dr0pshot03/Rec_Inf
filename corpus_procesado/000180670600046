spatially organized representation colour macaque cortical area v2 
neurons responding selectively different colours found various cortical areas macaque monkeys however little known whether representation colour spatially organized cortical area cortical area v2 contains modules respond preferentially chromatic modulation located thin cytochrome oxidase stripes- show within beyond modules gratings different colours produce activations peak different locations optical recording intrinsic signals revealed peak regions responses different colours spatially organized order colour stimuli arranged din german standard colour chart colour system nearby regions represented colours similar hue found set colour-specific regions formed --mm-wide approximately -mm long bands varied shape linear nearly circular finding suggests thin stripes v2 contain functional maps colour stimulus represented location response activation peak
