feedback regulation adaptive immunity fundamental mechanism controlling overall output different signal transduction pathways including mediated t-cell antigen receptor tcr calcineurin- ras- known essential functions t-cell activation however calcineurin signalling pathway terminated process still largely unknown although several endogenous inhibitors calcineurin reported- none fulfils criteria feedback inhibitor expression responsive tcr signalling identify endogenous inhibitor calcineurin named carabin also inhibits ras signalling pathway intrinsic ras gtpase-activating protein gap activity expression carabin upregulated tcr signalling manner sensitive inhibitors calcineurin indicating carabin constitutes part negative regulatory loop intracellular tcr signalling pathway knockdown carabin short interfering rna led significant enhancement interleukin production antigen-specific t cells vitro vivo thus carabin negative feedback inhibitor calcineurin signalling pathway also mediates crosstalk calcineurin ras
