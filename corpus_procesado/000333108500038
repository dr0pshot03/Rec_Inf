activity protein kinase ripk3 determines whether cells die necroptosis apoptosis 
receptor-interacting protein kinase ripk1 ripk3 trigger pro-inflammatory cell death termed necroptosis studies ripk3-deficient mice ripk1 inhibitor necrostatin suggest necroptosis exacerbates pathology many disease models engineered mice expressing catalytically inactive ripk3 d161n ripk1 d138n determine need active kinase whole animal unexpectedly ripk3 d161n promoted lethal ripk1-and caspase--dependent apoptosis contrast mice expressing ripk1 d138n viable like ripk3-deficient mice resistant tumor necrosis factor tnf-induced hypothermia cells expressing ripk1 d138n resistant tnf-induced necroptosis whereas tnf-induced signaling pathways promoting gene transcription unperturbed data indicate kinase activity ripk3 essential necroptosis also governs whether cell activates caspase dies apoptosis
