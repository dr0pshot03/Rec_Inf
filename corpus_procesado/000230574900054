distinct kinetic changes neurotransmitter release snare protein cleavage
neurotransmitter release triggered calcium ions depends critically correct function three types snare [soluble n-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein snap receptor] proteins use large calyx held presynaptic terminal rats found cleavage different snare proteins clostridial neurotoxins caused distinct kinetic changes neurotransmitter release elevating calcium ion concentration directly presynaptic terminal use caged calcium cleavage snap botulinum toxin bont/a produced strong reduction calcium sensitivity release whereas cleavage syntaxin using bont/c1 synaptobrevin using tetanus toxin tent produced all-or-nothing block without changing kinetics remaining vesicles stimulating release calcium influx channels difference bont/c1 tent emerged suggests cleavage synaptobrevin modifies coupling channels release-competent vesicles
