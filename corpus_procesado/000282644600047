two histone marks establish inner centromere chromosome bi-orientation 
proper partitioning chromosomes mitosis chromosomal passenger complex cpc including aurora b survivin must localized center paired kinetochores site called inner centromere largely unknown defines inner centromere cpc targeted site show phosphorylation histone h3-threonine h3-pt3 mediated haspin cooperates bub1-mediated histone 2a-serine h2a-s121 phosphorylation targeting cpc inner centromere fission yeast human cells h3-pt3 promotes nucleosome binding survivin whereas phosphorylated h2a-s121 facilitates binding shugoshin centromeric cpc adaptor haspin colocalizes cohesin associating pds5 whereas bub1 localizes kinetochores thus inner centromere defined intersection two histone kinases
