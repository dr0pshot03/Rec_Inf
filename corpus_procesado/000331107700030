polygenic burden rare disruptive mutations schizophrenia 
schizophrenia common disease complex aetiology probably involving multiple heterogeneous genetic factors analysing exome sequences schizophrenia cases controls demonstrate polygenic burden primarily arising rare less disruptive mutations distributed across many genes particularly enriched gene sets include voltage-gated calcium ion channel signalling complex formed activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated scaffold protein arc postsynaptic density sets previously implicated genome-wide association copy-number variation studies similar reports autism targets fragile x mental retardation protein fmrp product fmr1 enriched case mutations individual gene-based test achieves significance correction multiple testing detect alleles moderately low frequency approximately per cent moderately large effect taken together data suggest population-based exome sequencing can discover risk alleles complements established gene-mapping paradigms neuropsychiatric disease
