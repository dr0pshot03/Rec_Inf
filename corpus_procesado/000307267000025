deconstruction neural circuit hunger
hunger complex behavioural state elicits intense food seeking consumption behaviours rapidly recapitulated activation starvation-sensitive agrp neurons present entry point reverse-engineering neural circuits hunger mapped synaptic interactions agrp neurons multiple cell populations mice probed contribution distinct circuits feeding behaviour using optogenetic pharmacogenetic techniques inhibitory circuit paraventricular hypothalamus pvh neurons substantially accounted acute agrp neuron-evoked eating whereas two prominent circuits insufficient within pvh found agrp neurons target inhibit oxytocin neurons small population selectively lost prader-willi syndrome condition involving insatiable hunger developing strategies evaluating molecularly defined circuits show agrp neuron suppression oxytocin neurons critical evoked feeding experiments reveal new neural circuit regulates hunger state pathways associated overeating disorders
