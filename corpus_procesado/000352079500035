mechanisms antiwear tribofilm growth revealed situ single-asperity sliding contacts 
zinc dialkyldithiophosphates zddps form antiwear tribofilms sliding interfaces widely used additives automotive lubricants mechanisms governing tribofilm growth well understood limits development replacements offer better performance less likely degrade automobile catalytic converters time using atomic force microscopy zddp-containing lubricant base stock elevated temperatures monitored growth properties tribofilms situ well-defined single-asperity sliding nanocontacts surface-based nucleation growth thickness saturation patchy tribofilms observed growth rate increased exponentially either applied compressive stress temperature consistent thermally activated stress-assisted reaction rate model although models rely presence iron catalyze tribofilm growth films grew regardless presence iron either tip substrate highlighting critical role stress thermal activation
