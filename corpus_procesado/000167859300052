hedgehog acts somatic stem cell factor drosophila ovary 
secreted signalling molecules hedgehog hh family many essential patterning roles development diverse organisms including drosophila humans although hedge hog proteins commonly affect cell fate can also stimulate cell proliferation humans several distinctive cancers including basal-cell carcinoma result mutations aberrantly activate hh signal transduction drosophila hh directly stimulates proliferation ovarian somatic cells- show hh acts specifically stem cells drosophila ovary cells proliferate stem cells absence hh signalling whereas excessive hh signalling produces supernumerary stem cells deduce hh stem-cell factor suggest human cancers due excessive hh signalling might result aberrant expansion stem cell pools
