klf family members regulate intrinsic axon regeneration ability
neurons central nervous system cns lose ability regenerate early development underlying mechanisms unknown screening genes developmentally regulated retinal ganglion cells rgcs identified kruppel-like factor klf4 transcriptional repressor axon growth rgcs cns neurons rgcs lacking klf4 showed increased axon growth vitro optic nerve injury vivo related klf family members suppressed enhanced axon growth differing extents several growth-suppressive klfs up-regulated postnatally whereas growth-enhancing klfs down-regulated thus coordinated activities different klfs regulate regenerative capacity cns neurons
