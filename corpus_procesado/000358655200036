metabolic co-dependence gives rise collective oscillations within biofilms
cells reside within community can cooperate also compete resources remains unclear opposing interactions resolved population level investigate internal conflict within microbial bacillus subtilis biofilm community: cells biofilm periphery protect interior cells external attack also starve nutrient consumption discover conflict protection starvation resolved emergence long-range metabolic co-dependence peripheral interior cells result biofilm growth halts periodically increasing nutrient availability sheltered interior cells show collective oscillation biofilm growth benefits community event chemical attack findings indicate oscillations support population-level conflict resolution coordinating competing metabolic demands space time suggesting new strategies control biofilm growth
