femtosecond x-ray protein nanocrystallography 
x-ray crystallography provides vast majority macromolecular structures success method relies growing crystals sufficient size conventional measurements necessary increase x-ray dose record data crystals small leads extensive damage diffraction signal can recorded1- particularly challenging obtain large well-diffracting crystals membrane proteins fewer unique structures determined despite importance living cells present method structure determination single-crystal x-ray diffraction snapshots collected fully hydrated stream nanocrystals using femtosecond pulses hard-x-ray free-electron laser linac coherent light source4 prove concept nanocrystals photosystem one largest membrane protein complexes5 diffraction patterns collected study three-dimensional data set assembled individual photosystem nanocrystals similar nm mm size mitigate problem radiation damage crystallography using pulses briefer timescale damage processes6 offers new approach structure determination macromolecules yield crystals sufficient size studies using conventional radiation sources particularly sensitive radiation damage
