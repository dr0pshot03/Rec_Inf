identifying vibrations destabilize crystals characterize glassy state 
high-resolution inelastic neutron scattering used identify major sources low-frequency vibrations zeolite crystals dispersed nondispersed modes found prominent early stages compressive amorphization decline dramatically strength glass conventional density created identifying dispersed modes characteristic vibrations various secondary building units zeolitic structures boson peak characteristic glassy state can attributed vibrations within connected rings many different sizes nondispersed phonon features zeolites retained amorphized glass also replicated silica modes librational origin responsible destabilizing microporous crystalline structure converting resulting glass low high-density phase associated changes network topology affect boson peak
