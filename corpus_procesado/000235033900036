point defects largely govern electrochemical properties oxides: low defect concentrations conductivity increases concentration however higher concentrations defect defect interactions start dominate thus searching electrochemically active materials fuel cell anodes high defect concentration generally avoided describe oxide anode formed lanthanum-substituted strontium titanate la-srtio3 control oxygen stoichiometry order break extended defect intergrowth regions create phases considerable disordered oxygen defects substitute ti phases ga mn induce redox activity allow flexible coordination material demonstrates impressive fuel cell performance using wet hydrogen degrees c also important fuel cell technology achieve efficient electrode operation different hydrocarbon fuels although fuels demanding pure hydrogen best anode materials date-ni-ysz yttria-stabilized zirconia cermets suffer disadvantages related low tolerance sulphur carbon build-up using hydrocarbon fuels though device modifications lower temperature operation can avoid volume instability redox cycling anode material active methane oxidation high temperatures open circuit voltages excess v materials design concept use lead devices enable more-efficient energy extraction fossil fuels carbon-neutral fuels
