identification iridium-containing compound formal oxidation state ix
one important classifications chemistry within periodic table concept formal oxidation states- preparation characterization compounds containing elements unusual oxidation states great interest chemists highest experimentally known formal oxidation state chemical element present viii2- although higher oxidation states postulated compounds oxidation state viii include several xenon compounds example xeo4 xeo3f2 well-characterized species ruo4 oso4 refs iridium nine valence electrons predicted greatest chance oxidized beyond viii oxidation state recent matrix-isolation experiments iro4 molecule characterized isolated molecule rare-gas matrices valence electron configuration iridium iro4 5d formal oxidation state viii removal remaining d electron iro4 lead iridium tetroxide cation [iro4]+ recently predicted stable iridium formal oxidation state ix speculation formation [iro4]+ species experimental observations structurally confirmed report formation [iro4]+ identification infrared photodissociation spectroscopy quantum-chemical calculations carried highest level theory available today predict iridium tetroxide cation t-d-symmetrical structure d electron configuration stable possible [iro4]+ isomers
