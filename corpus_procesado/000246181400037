signals chloroplasts converge regulate nuclear gene expression
plastid-to-nucleus retrograde signaling coordinates nuclear gene expression chloroplast function essential photoautotrophic life-style plants three retrograde signals described little known signaling pathways show gun1 chloroplast-localized pentatricopeptide-repeat protein abi4 apetala ap2-type transcription factor common three pathways abi4 binds promoter retrograde-regulated gene conserved motif found close proximity light-regulatory element propose model multiple indicators aberrant plastid function arabidopsis integrated upstream gun1 within plastids leads abi4-mediated repression nuclear-encoded genes
