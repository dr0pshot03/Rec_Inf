netrin--mediated axon outgrowth camp production requires interaction adenosine a2b receptor
netrins family laminin-related secreted proteins critical controlling axon elongation pathfinding- dcc deleted colorectal cancer protein proposed receptor netrin light many observations including inhibition netrin--mediated axon outgrowth attraction presence anti-dcc antiserum- similitude nervous system defects dcc netrin knockout mice results receptor swapping experiments previous studies failed show direct interaction dcc netrin ref suggesting possibility additional receptor coreceptor show dcc interacts membrane-associated adenosine a2b receptor g-protein-coupled receptor induces camp accumulation binding adenosine show a2b actually netrin receptor induces camp accumulation binding netrin- finally show netrin--dependent outgrowth dorsal spinal cord axons directly involves a2b together results indicate growth-promoting function netrin may require receptor complex containing dcc a2b
