ultrasensitive fluorescent proteins imaging neuronal activity
fluorescent calcium sensors widely used image neural activity using structure-based mutagenesis neuron-based screening developed family ultrasensitive protein calcium sensors gcamp6 outperformed sensors cultured neurons zebrafish flies mice vivo layer / pyramidal neurons mouse visual cortex gcamp6 reliably detected single action potentials neuronal somata orientation-tuned synaptic calcium transients individual dendritic spines orientation tuning structurally persistent spines largely stable timescales weeks orientation tuning averaged across spine populations predicted tuning parent cell although somata gabaergic neurons showed little orientation tuning dendrites included highly tuned dendritic segments --mm long gcamp6 sensors thus provide new windows organization dynamics neural circuits multiple spatial temporal scales
