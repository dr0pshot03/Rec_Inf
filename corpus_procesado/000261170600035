tight regulation unstructured proteins: transcript synthesis protein degradation 
altered abundance several intrinsically unstructured proteins iups associated perturbed cellular signaling may lead pathological conditions cancer therefore important understand cells precisely regulate availability iups observed regulation transcript clearance proteolytic degradation translational rate contribute controlling abundance iups present low amounts short periods time abundant phosphorylation low stochasticity transcription translation indicate availability iups can finely tuned fidelity signaling may require iups available appropriate amounts present longer needed
