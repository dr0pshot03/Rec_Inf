direct imaging multiple planets orbiting star hr
direct imaging exoplanetary systems powerful technique can reveal jupiter like planets wide orbits can enable detailed characterization planetary atmospheres key step toward imaging earth like planets imaging detections challenging combined effect small angular separation large luminosity contrast planet host star high contrast observations keck gemini telescopes revealed three planets orbiting star hr projected separations astronomical units multi epoch data show counter clockwise orbital motion three imaged planets low luminosity companions estimated age system imply planetary masses times jupiter system resembles scaled version outer portion solar system
