tandem transcription translation regulatory sensing uncharged tryptophan trna 
bacillus subtilis anti-trap protein inhibits regulatory protein trap trp rna-binding attenuation protein thereby eliminating transcription termination leader region trp operon transcription operon activated uncharged tryptophan transfer rna trnatrp show translation also regulated uncharged trnatrp -residue coding region containing three consecutive tryptophan codons located immediately preceding structural gene completion translation coding region inhibits synthesis whereas incomplete translation increases production tandem sensing uncharged trnatrp therefore regulates synthesis turn regulates traps ability inhibit trp operon expression
