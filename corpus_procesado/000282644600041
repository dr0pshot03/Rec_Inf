oxidative enzyme boosting enzymatic conversion recalcitrant polysaccharides 
efficient enzymatic conversion crystalline polysaccharides crucial economically environmentally sustainable bioeconomy remains unfavorably inefficient describe enzyme acts surface crystalline chitin introduces chain breaks generates oxidized chain ends thus promoting degradation chitinases enzymatic activity discovered characterized using mass spectrometry chromatographic separation methods detect oxidized products generated absence presence ho o strong indications similar enzymes exist work cellulose findings demonstrate existence hitherto unknown enzyme activity also provide new avenues toward efficient enzymatic conversion biomass
