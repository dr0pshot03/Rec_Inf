generation mouse induced pluripotent stem cells without viral vectors
induced pluripotent stem ips cells generated mouse human somatic cells introducing oct3/ sox2 either klf4 c-myc nanog lin28 using retroviruses lentiviruses patient specific ips cells useful drug discovery regenerative medicine however viral integration host genome increases risk tumorigenicity report generation mouse ips cells without viral vectors repeated transfection two expression plasmids one containing complementary dnas cdnas oct3/ sox2 klf4 containing c myc cdna mouse embryonic fibroblasts resulted ips cells without evidence plasmid integration produced teratomas transplanted mice contributed adult chimeras production virus-free ips cells albeit embryonic fibroblasts addresses critical safety concern potential use ips cells regenerative medicine
