regulation oligodendrocyte differentiation myelination
despite importance myelin rapid conduction action potentials molecular bases oligodendrocyte differentiation central nervous system cns myelination still incompletely understood recent results greatly advanced understanding identifying new transcriptional regulators myelin gene expression elucidating vital roles micrornas controlling myelination clarifying extracellular signaling mechanisms orchestrate development myelin studies also demonstrated unexpected level plasticity myelin adult cns recent advances provide new insight remyelination may stimulated demyelinating disorders multiple sclerosis
