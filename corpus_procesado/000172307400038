collisions gravitational reaccumulation: forming asteroid families satellites
numerical simulations collisional disruption large asteroids show although parent body totally shattered subsequent gravitational reaccumulation leads formation entire family large small objects dynamical properties similar parent body simulations performed two different collisional regimes representative asteroid families eunomia koronis results indicate large family members must made gravitationally reaccumulated fragments post-collision member size distribution orbital dispersion steeper smaller respectively evolved families observed today satellites form frequently around family members
