constraints composition earths core ab initio calculations 
knowledge composition earths core- important understanding melting point therefore temperature inner-core boundary temperature profile core mantle addition partitioning light elements solid liquid outer core freezes inner-core boundary believed drive compositional convection turn generates earths magnetic field generally accepted liquid outer core solid inner core consist mainly iron outer core however also thought contain significant fraction light elements density-as deduced seismological data measurements-is per cent less estimated pure liquid iron- similar evidence indicates smaller still appreciable fraction light elements inner core leading candidates light elements present core sulphur oxygen silicon obtain constraint core composition derived ab initio calculation chemical potentials light elements dissolved solid liquid iron present results case sulphur provide strong evidence proposal outer core close binary iron-sulphur mixture
