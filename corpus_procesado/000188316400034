electron transfer-induced dynamics oxygen molecules tio2 surface
diffusion oxygen molecules transition metal oxide surfaces plays vital role understanding catalysis photocatalysis materials means time-resolved scanning tunneling microscopy provide evidence charge transfer-induced diffusion mechanism o molecules adsorbed rutile tio2 surface o hopping rate depended number surface donors oxygen vacancies determines density conduction band electrons results may implications understanding oxidation processes metal oxides general
