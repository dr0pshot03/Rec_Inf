broadband 2d electronic spectroscopy reveals carotenoid dark state purple bacteria
although energy transfer processes natural light-harvesting systems intensively studied past years certain details underlying mechanisms remain controversial performed broadband two-dimensional 2d electronic spectroscopy measurements light-harvesting proteins purple bacteria isolated carotenoids order characterize detail excited-state manifold carotenoids channel energy bacteriochlorophyll molecules data revealed well-resolved signal consistent previously postulated carotenoid dark state presence confirmed global kinetic analysis results point states role mediating energy flow carotenoid bacteriochlorophyll
