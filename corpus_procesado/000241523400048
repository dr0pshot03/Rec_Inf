exploration molecular dynamics transient sorption fluids mesoporous materials 
recent years considerable progress made development novel porous materials controlled architectures pore sizes mesoporous range- important feature materials phenomenon adsorption hysteresis: certain ranges applied pressure amount molecular species adsorbed mesoporous host higher desorption adsorption indicating failure system equilibrate although phenomenon known century underlying internal dynamics responsible hysteresis remain poorly understood- present combined experimental theoretical study microscopic macroscopic aspects relaxation dynamics associated hysteresis quantified direct measurement computer simulations molecular models using nuclear magnetic resonance techniques- vycor porous glass model mesoporous system explored relationship molecular self-diffusion global uptake dynamics states outside hysteresis region relaxation process found essentially diffusive character within hysteresis region dynamics slow dramatically long times dominated activated rearrangement adsorbate density within host material
