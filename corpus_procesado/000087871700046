mosaic evolution brain structure mammals 
mammalian brain comprises number functionally distinct systems might therefore expected natural selection particular behavioural capacities caused size changes selectively systems mediating capacities- claimed however developmental constraints limited mosaic evolution causing co-ordinated size change among individual brain components analyse comparative data demonstrate mosaic change important factor brain structure evolution first neocortex shows fivefold difference volume primates insectivores even accounting scaling relationship rest brain second brain structures major anatomical functional links evolved together independently evolutionary change structures true level basic brain subdivisions fine-grained functional systems hence brain evolution groups involved complex relationships among individual brain components
