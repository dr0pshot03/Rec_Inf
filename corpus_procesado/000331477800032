situ identification bipotent stem cells mammary gland 
mammary epithelium undergoes profound morphogenetic changes development architecturally comprises two primary lineages inner luminal outer myoepithelial cell layers two opposing concepts nature mammary stem cells mascs postnatal gland emerged one model based classical transplantation assays postulates bipotent mascs key role coordinating ductal epithelial expansion maintenance adult gland whereas second model proposes unipotent mascs identified lineage tracing contribute processes clonal cell-fate mapping studies using stochastic multicolour cre reporter combined new three-dimensional imaging strategy provide evidence existence bipotent mascs well distinct long-lived progenitor cells cellular dynamics different developmental stages support model stem progenitor cells drive morphogenesis puberty whereas bipotent mascs coordinate ductal homeostasis remodelling mouse adult gland
