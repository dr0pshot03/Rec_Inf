emotional learning selectively retroactively strengthens memories related events 
neurobiological models long-term memory propose mechanism initially weak memories strengthened subsequent activation engages common neural pathways minutes hours later synaptic tag-and-capture model hypothesized explain inconsequential information selectively consolidated following salient experiences behavioural evidence tag-and-capture provided rodent studies weak early memories strengthened future behavioural training whether process behavioural tagging occurs humans transform weak episodic memories stable long-term memories unknown show humans information selectively consolidated conceptually related information putatively represented common neural substrate made salient emotional learning experience memory neutral objects selectively enhanced objects category paired shock retroactive enhancements result emotional learning observed following period consolidation observed immediate memory test items strongly encoded fear conditioning findings provide new evidence generalized retroactive memory enhancement whereby inconsequential information can retroactively credited relevant therefore selectively remembered conceptually related information acquires salience future
