polarized light cues underlie compass calibration migratory songbirds 
migratory songbirds use geomagnetic field stars sun polarized light patterns determine migratory direction prevent navigational errors necessary calibrate compass systems common reference show migratory savannah sparrows use polarized light cues region sky near horizon recalibrate magnetic compass sunrise sunset suggest skylight polarization patterns used derive absolute ie geographic directional system provides primary calibration reference compasses migratory songbirds
