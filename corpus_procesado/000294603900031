magnetic-field-induced charge-stripe order high-temperature superconductor yba2cu3oy
electronic charges introduced copper-oxide cuo2 planes generate high-transition-temperature t-c superconductivity special circumstances can also order filaments called stripes whether underlying tendency towards charge order present copper oxides whether relationship superconductivity however two highly controversial issues uncover underlying electronic order magnetic fields strong enough destabilize superconductivity can used experiments including quantum oscillations- yba2cu3oy extremely clean copper oxide charge order now observed suggested superconductivity competes spin rather charge order- report nuclear magnetic resonance measurements showing high magnetic fields actually induce charge order without spin order cuo2 planes yba2cu3oy observed static unidirectional modulation charge density breaks translational symmetry thus explaining quantum oscillation results argue probably 4a-periodic modulation stripe-ordered copper oxides develops superconductivity fades away near / hole doping la2-xbaxcuo4 ref suggests charge order although visibly pinned cuo chains yba2cu3oy intrinsic propensity superconducting planes high-t-c copper oxides
