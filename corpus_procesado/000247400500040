vibrational excitations chd3 preferentially promote reactivity toward chlorine atom 
influence vibrational excitation chemical reaction dynamics well understood triatomic reactions multiple modes larger systems complicate efforts toward validation predictive framework although recent experiments support selective vibrational enhancements reactivities studies generally properly account differing amounts total energy deposited excitation different modes precise tuning translational energies measured relative efficiencies vibration translation promoting gas-phase reaction chd3 cl atom form hcl cd3 unexpectedly observed c-h stretch excitation effective equivalent amount translational energy raising overall reaction efficiency; cd3 bend excitation slightly effective however vibrational excitation strong impact product state angular distributions c-h stretch-excited reactants leading predominantly forward-scattered vibrationally excited hcl
