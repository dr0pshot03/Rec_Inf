cd4+ t cells required secondary expansion memory cd8+ t lymphocytes
long-standing paradox cellular immunology concerns conditional requirement cd4+ t-helper t-h cells priming cytotoxic cd8+ t lymphocyte ctl responses vivo whereas ctl responses certain viruses can primed absence cd4+ t cells others mediated cross-priming host antigen-presenting cells dependent t-h cells- clearer understanding contribution t-h cells ctl development hampered fact t-h-independent responses demonstrated ex vivo primary cytotoxic effectors whereas t-h-dependent responses generally require secondary vitro re-stimulation detection monitored primary secondary responses t-h-dependent t-h-independent ctls find cases cd4+ t cells dispensable primary expansion cd8+ t cells differentiation cytotoxic effectors however secondary ctl expansion secondary response upon re-encounter antigen wholly dependent presence t-h cells priming results demonstrate t-cell help programmed cd8+ t cells priming conferring cells hallmark immune response memory: capacity functional expansion re-encounter antigen
