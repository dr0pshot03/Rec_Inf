resolve mechanisms switch competition cooperation key understanding biological organization particularly relevant intrasexual competition often leads males harming females recent theory proposes kin selection may modulate female harm relaxing competition among male relatives- experimentally manipulate relatedness groups male drosophila melanogaster competing females demonstrate expected within-group relatedness inhibits male competition female harm females exposed groups three brothers unrelated female higher lifetime reproductive success slower reproductive ageing compared females exposed groups three males unrelated triplets brothers also fought less courted females less intensively lived longer triplets unrelated males however associations among brothers may vulnerable invasion minorities unrelated males: two brothers matched unrelated male unrelated male sired average twice many offspring either brother results demonstrate relatedness can profoundly affect fitness modulation intrasexual competition flies plastically adjust sexual behaviour manner consistent kin-selection theory
