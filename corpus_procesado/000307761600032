long-term decline global atmospheric ethane concentrations implications methane 
methane ethane abundant hydrocarbon remote atmosphere precursor tropospheric ozone influences atmospheres oxidative capacity reaction hydroxyl radical ethanes primary atmospheric sink- present longest continuous record global atmospheric ethane levels show global ethane emission rates decreased teragrams per year per cent attribute decreasing fugitive emissions ethanes fossil fuel source-most probably decreased venting flaring natural gas oil fields-rather decline major sources biofuel use biomass burning ethanes major emission sources shared methane recent studies disagreed whether reduced fossil fuel microbial emissions caused methanes atmospheric growth rate slow findings suggest reduced fugitive fossil fuel emissions account least teragrams per year per cent decrease methanes global emissions significantly contributing methanes slowing atmospheric growth rate since mid-1980s
