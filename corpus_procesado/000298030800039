impact-driven dynamo early moon 
origin lunar magnetic anomalies1- remains unresolved discovery four decades ago commonly invoked hypothesis moon might possessed thermally driven core dynamo3 theory problematical given small size core required surface magnetic field strengths6 alternative hypothesis impact events might amplified ambient fields near antipodes largest basins7 many magnetic anomalies exist associated basin antipodes propose new model magnetic field generation dynamo action comes impact-induced changes moons rotation rate basin-forming impact events energetic enough unlocked moon synchronous rotation8 demonstrate subsequent large-scale fluid flows core excited tidal distortion core-mantle boundary9 powered lunar dynamo predicted surface magnetic field strengths order several microteslas consistent palaeomagnetic measurements5 duration fields sufficient explain central magnetic anomalies associated several large impact basins
