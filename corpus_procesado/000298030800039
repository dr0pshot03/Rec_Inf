impact-driven dynamo early moon
origin lunar magnetic anomalies- remains unresolved discovery four decades ago commonly invoked hypothesis moon might possessed thermally driven core dynamo theory problematical given small size core required surface magnetic field strengths alternative hypothesis impact events might amplified ambient fields near antipodes largest basins many magnetic anomalies exist associated basin antipodes propose new model magnetic field generation dynamo action comes impact-induced changes moons rotation rate basin-forming impact events energetic enough unlocked moon synchronous rotation demonstrate subsequent large-scale fluid flows core excited tidal distortion core-mantle boundary powered lunar dynamo predicted surface magnetic field strengths order several microteslas consistent palaeomagnetic measurements duration fields sufficient explain central magnetic anomalies associated several large impact basins
