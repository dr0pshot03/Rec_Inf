rapid modelling cooperating genetic events cancer somatic genome editing
cancer multistep process involves mutations alterations oncogenes tumour suppressor genes genome sequencing studies identified large collection genetic alterations occur human cancers- however determination mutations causally related tumorigenesis remains major challenge describe novel crispr/cas9-based approach rapid functional investigation candidate genes well-established autochthonous mouse models cancer using krasg12d-driven lung cancer model performed functional characterization panel tumour suppressor genes knownloss-of-function alterations human lung cancer cre-dependent somatic activation oncogenic krasg12d combined crispr/cas9-mediated genome editing tumour suppressor genes resulted lung adenocarcinomas distinct histopathological molecular features rapid somatic genome engineering approach enables functional characterization putative cancer genes lung tissues using autochthonous mouse models anticipate approach can used systematically dissect complex catalogue mutations identified cancer genome sequencing studies
