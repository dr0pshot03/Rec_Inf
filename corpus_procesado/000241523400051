effect water electrical conductivity olivine
well known water source hydrogen affects physical chemical properties minerals example plastic deformation- melting temperature accordingly plays important role dynamics geochemical evolution earth estimating water content earths mantle direct sampling provides limited data set shallow regions < km depth geophysical observations electrical conductivity considered sensitive water content experimental study determine effect water electrical conductivity olivine abundant mineral earths mantle report laboratory study dependence electrical conductivity olivine aggregates water content high temperature pressure electrical conductivity synthetic polycrystalline olivine determined c impedance measurements pressure gpa temperature range 273k water contents wt% results show electrical conductivity strongly dependent water content depends modestly temperature water content dependence conductivity best explained model electrical conduction due motion free protons comparison laboratory data geophysical observations suggests typical oceanic asthenosphere contains similar - wt% water whereas water content continental upper mantle less similar - wt%
