changing boreal methane sources constant biomass burning last termination
past atmospheric methane concentrations show strong fluctuations parallel rapid glacial climate changes northern hemisphere superimposed glacial interglacial doubling methane concentrations- processes driving observed fluctuations remain uncertain can constrained using methane isotopic information ice cores present ice core record carbon isotopic ratios methane entire last glacial interglacial transition data show carbon atmospheric methane isotopically much heavier cold climate periods help box model constrained present data previously published results able estimate magnitude past individual methane emission sources atmospheric lifetime methane find methane emissions due biomass burning tg methane per year remained roughly constant throughout glacial termination atmospheric lifetime methane reduced cold climate periods also show boreal wetlands important source methane warm events methane emissions essentially shut cold climate conditions
