ultrafast tryptophan-to-heme electron transfer myoglobins revealed uv 2d spectroscopy 
tryptophan commonly used study protein structure dynamics protein folding donor fluorescence resonant energy transfer fret studies using ultra-broadband ultrafast two-dimensional 2d spectroscopy ultraviolet uv transient absorption visible range disentangled excited state decay pathways tryptophan amino acid residues ferric myoglobins mbcn metmb whereas distant tryptophan trp relaxes energy transfer heme trp excitation predominantly decays electron transfer heme excited trp-> heme electron transfer occurs < picoseconds quantum yield % edge-to-edge distance similar angstroms outcompeting fret process results raise question whether electron transfer pathways occur larger class proteins
