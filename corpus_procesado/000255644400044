temperature sensing olfactory neuron circuit controlling behavior c-elegans 
temperature unavoidable environmental cue affects metabolism behavior creature earth yet animals perceive temperature poorly understood nematode caenorhabditis elegans memorizes temperatures stored information modifies subsequent migration along temperature gradient show olfactory neuron designated awc senses temperature calcium imaging revealed awc responds temperature changes response thresholds differ depending temperature animal previously exposed mutant impaired heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide binding protein g protein mediated signaling awc hyperresponsive temperature whereas aiy interneuron postsynaptic awc hyporesponsive temperature thus temperature sensation exhibits robust influence neural circuit controlling memory regulated behavior
