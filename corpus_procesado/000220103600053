insight tubulin regulation complex colchicine stathmin-like domain 
microtubules cytoskeletal polymers tubulin involved many cellular functions dynamic instability controlled numerous compounds proteins including colchicine1 stathmin family proteins23 way microtubule instability regulated molecular level remained elusive mainly lack appropriate structural data present structure angstrom resolution tubulin complex colchicine stathmin-like domain sld rb3 shows interaction rb3-sld two tubulin heterodimers curved complex capped sld amino-terminal domain prevents incorporation complexed tubulin microtubules comparison structure tubulin protofilaments4 shows changes subunits tubulin switches straight conformation curved one changes correlate loss lateral contacts provide rationale rapid microtubule depolymerization characteristic dynamic instability moreover tubulin-colchicine complex sheds light mechanism colchicines activity: show colchicine binds location prevents curved tubulin adopting straight structure inhibits assembly
