particle consistent higgs boson observed atlas detector large hadron collider
nearly years ago theoretical physicists proposed field permeates universe gives energy vacuum field required explain fundamental particles mass numerous precision measurements recent decades provided indirect support existence field one crucial prediction theory remained unconfirmed despite years experimental searches: existence massive particle standard model higgs boson atlas experiment large hadron collider cern now observed production new particle mass giga-electron volts decay signatures consistent expected higgs particle result strong support standard model particle physics including presence vacuum field existence properties newly discovered particle may also consequences beyond standard model
