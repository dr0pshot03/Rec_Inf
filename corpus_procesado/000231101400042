experimental approach percolation sticky nanotubes
percolation statistical concept describes formation infinite cluster connected particles pathways lowering percolation threshold critical issue achieve light low-cost conductive composites made insulating matrix loaded conductive particles interest applications charge dissipation electrical conductivity sought films coatings paints composite materials one route decreasing loading required percolation use rod-like particles theoretical predictions indicate may also achieved altering interaction potential particles although percolation may always respond monotonicalty interactions use adhesive rods can expected ideal combination using system made carbon nanotubes aqueous surfactant solution find small attraction can markedly lower percolation threshold strength effect can thereby direct technological interest explain large variability experimental results literature dealing electrical behavior composites loaded conducting rods
