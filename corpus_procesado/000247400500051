antifungal agent inhibits aminoacyl-trna synthetase trapping trna editing site
aminoacyl-transfer rna trna synthetases catalyze attachment correct amino acid corresponding trna translation genetic code proven antimicrobial drug targets show broad-spectrum antifungal fluoro--dihydro--hydroxy--benzoxaborole an2690 development treatment onychomycosis inhibits yeast cytoplasmic leucyl-trna synthetase formation stable trnaleu-an2690 adduct editing site enzyme adduct formation mediated boron atom an2690 -oxygen atoms trnas -terminal adenosine trapping enzyme-bound trnaleu editing site prevents catalytic turnover thus inhibiting synthesis leucyl-trnaleu consequentially blocking protein synthesis result establishes editing site bona fide target aminoacyl-trna synthetase inhibitors
