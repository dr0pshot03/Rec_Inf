conformationally controlled chemistry: excited-state dynamics dictate ground-state reaction
ion imaging reveals distinct photodissociation dynamics propanal cations initially prepared either cis gauche conformation even though isomers differ slightly energy face small interconversion barrier product kinetic energy distributions hydrogen atom elimination channels bimodal two peaks readily assigned propanoyl cation hydroxyallyl cation coproducts ab initio multiple spawning dynamical calculations suggest distinct ultrafast dynamics excited state deposit conformer isolated regions ground-state potential energy surface distinct regions conformer interconversion effectively compete dissociation
