replication-transcription switch human mitochondria
coordinated replication expression mitochondrial genome critical metabolically active cells various stages development however known whether replication transcription can occur simultaneously without interfering whether mitochondrial dna copy number can regulated transcription machinery found interaction human transcription elongation factor tefm mitochondrial rna polymerase nascent transcript prevents generation replication primers increases transcription processivity thereby serves molecular switch replication transcription appear mutually exclusive processes mitochondria tefm may allow mitochondria increase transcription rates consequence respiration adenosine triphosphate production without need replicate mitochondrial dna observed spermatogenesis early stages embryogenesis
