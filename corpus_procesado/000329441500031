patterning growth control membrane-tethered wingless
wnts evolutionarily conserved secreted signalling proteins various developmental contexts spread site synthesis form gradient activate target-gene expression distance however requirement wnts spread never directly tested used genome engineering replace endogenous wingless gene encodes main drosophila wnt one expresses membrane-tethered form protein surprisingly resulting flies viable produced normally patterned appendages nearly right size albeit delay show prospective wing prolonged wingless transcription followed memory earlier signalling allows persistent expression relevant target genes suggest therefore spread wingless dispensable patterning growth even though probably contributes increasing cell proliferation
