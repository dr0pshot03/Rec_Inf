activity-dependent neuronal signalling autism spectrum disorder 
neuronal activity induces post-translational modification synaptic molecules promotes localized protein synthesis within dendrites activates gene transcription thereby regulating synaptic function allowing neuronal circuits respond dynamically experience evidence indicates many genes mutated autism spectrum disorder crucial components activity-dependent signalling networks regulate synapse development plasticity dysregulation activity-dependent signalling pathways neurons may therefore key role aetiology autism spectrum disorder
