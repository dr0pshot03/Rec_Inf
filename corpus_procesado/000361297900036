eukaryotic dna replication terminates replisomes adjacent replication origins converge termination involves local completion dna synthesis decatenation daughter molecules replisome disassembly termination difficult study termination events generally asynchronous sequence nonspecific overcome challenges paused converging replisomes site-specific barrier xenopus egg extracts upon removal barrier forks underwent synchronous site-specific termination allowing mechanistic dissection process show dna synthesis slow detectably forks approach leading strands pass unhindered undergoing ligation downstream lagging strands dissociation replicative cmg helicase comprising cdc45 mcm2 gins occurs final ligation step required completion dna synthesis strongly suggesting converging cmgs pass one another dissociate double-stranded dna termination mechanism allows rapid completion dna synthesis avoiding premature replisome disassembly
