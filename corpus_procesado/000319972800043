sub-rayleigh supershear ruptures stick-slip experiments crustal rocks
supershear earthquake ruptures propagate faster shear wave velocity although evidence occurs nature experimentally demonstrated use crustal rocks performed stick-slip experiments westerly granite controlled upper-crustal stress conditions supershear ruptures systematically occur normal stress exceeds megapascals mpa resulting stress drops order mpa comparable stress drops inferred seismology crustal earthquakes experiments sub-rayleigh-to-supershear transition length centimeters suggesting rupture asperities along fault may propagate locally supershear velocities turn sudden accelerations decelerations play important role generation high-frequency radiation overall rupture-energy budget
