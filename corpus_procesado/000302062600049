rapamycin-induced insulin resistance mediated mtorc2 loss uncoupled longevity 
rapamycin inhibitor mechanistic target rapamycin complex mtorc1 extends life spans yeast flies mice calorie restriction increases life span insulin sensitivity proposed function inhibition mtorc1 yet paradoxically chronic administration rapamycin substantially impairs glucose tolerance insulin action demonstrate rapamycin disrupted second mtor complex mtorc2 vivo mtorc2 required insulin-mediated suppression hepatic gluconeogenesis decreased mtorc1 signaling sufficient extend life span independently changes glucose homeostasis female mice heterozygous mtor mlst8 exhibited decreased mtorc1 activity extended life span normal glucose tolerance insulin sensitivity thus mtorc2 disruption important mediator effects rapamycin vivo
