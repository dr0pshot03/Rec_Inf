fibulin-/dance essential elastogenesis vivo 
elastic fibre system principal role structure function various types organs require elasticity large arteries lung skin although elastic fibres known composed microfibril proteins example fibrillins latent transforming growth factor tgf-beta binding proteins polymerized elastin mechanism assembly development well understood report fibulin also known dance recently discovered integrin ligand essential determinant elastic fibre organization fibulin--/- mice generated gene targeting exhibit severely disorganized elastic fibre system throughout body fibulin--/- mice survive adulthood tortuous aorta loss compliance severe emphysema loose skin cutis laxa tissues contain fragmented elastin without increase elastase activity indicating defective development elastic fibres fibulin interacts directly elastic fibres vitro serves ligand cell surface integrins alphav beta3 alphav beta5 alpha9 beta1 aminoterminal domain thus fibulin may provide anchorage elastic fibres cells thereby acting stabilize organize elastic fibres skin lung vasculature
