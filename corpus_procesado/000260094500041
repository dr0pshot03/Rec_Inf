accurate temperature imaging based intermolecular coherences magnetic resonance
conventional magnetic resonance methods provide interior temperature profiles find use clinical applications hyperthermic therapy can develop inaccuracies caused inherently inhomogeneous magnetic field within tissues probe dynamics work poorly important applications fatty tissues present magnetic resonance method suitable imaging temperature wide range environments uses inherently sharp resonances intermolecular zero-quantum coherences case flipping water spin flipping nearby fat spin show method can rapidly accurately assign temperatures vivo absolute scale
