x-ray flares postmerger millisecond pulsars 
recent observations support suggestion short-duration gamma-ray bursts produced compact star mergers x-ray flares discovered two short gamma-ray bursts last much longer previously proposed postmerger energy-release time scales show can produced differentially rotating millisecond pulsars mergers binary neutron stars differential rotation leads windup interior poloidal magnetic fields resulting toroidal fields strong enough float break stellar surface magnetic reconnection-driven explosive events occur leading multiple x-ray flares minutes original gamma-ray burst
