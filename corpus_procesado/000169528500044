mineral disequilibrium lavas explained convective self-mixing open magma chambers
characteristic features many porphyritic andesite dacite lavas rich crystals display range disequilibrium features including reversely zoned crystals resorption surfaces wide ranges mineral compositions minerals equilibrium surrounding rock matrix features often interpreted evidence mixing magmas contrasting composition temperature origin however propose features can also caused convection within magma body single composition heated cooled describe petrological observations andesite lava erupted soufriere hills volcano montserrat indicate heating event intermingling crystals different thermal histories present experimental data representative groundmass composition lava indicate difficult explain calcic compositions plagioclase overgrowth rims microphenocrysts unless parts magma temperatures much higher inferred average temperature concept convective self-mixing allows us explain occurrence compositions minerals apparently coexist equilibrium conditions
