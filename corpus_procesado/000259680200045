molecular architecture "stressosome" signal integration transduction hub 
commonly used strategy microorganisms survive multiple stresses involves signal transduction cascade increases expression stress responsive genes stress signals can integrated multiprotein signaling hub responds various signals effect single outcome obtained medium resolution cryo electron microscopy reconstruction megadalton "stressosome" bacillus subtilis fitting known crystal structures components reconstruction gave pseudoatomic structure virus capsid like core sensory extensions suggest different sensory extensions respond different signals whereas conserved domains core integrate varied signals architecture stressosome provides potential cooperativity suggesting response tuned dependent magnitude chemophysical insult
