aminoglycoside antibiotics induce bacterial biofilm formation 
biofilms adherent aggregates bacterial cells form biotic abiotic surfaces including human tissues biofilms resist antibiotic treatment contribute bacterial persistence chronic infections hence elucidation mechanisms biofilms formed may assist treatment chronic infections pseudomonas aeruginosa airways patients cystic fibrosis show subinhibitory concentrations aminoglycoside antibiotics induce biofilm formation p aeruginosa escherichia coli p aeruginosa gene designated aminoglycoside response regulator arr essential induction contributed biofilm-specific aminoglycoside resistance arr gene predicted encode inner-membrane phosphodiesterase whose substrate cyclic di-guanosine monophosphate c-di-gmp bacterial second messenger regulates cell surface adhesiveness found membranes arr mutants diminished c-di-gmp phosphodiesterase activity p aeruginosa cells mutation changing predicted catalytic residue arr defective biofilm response tobramycin furthermore tobramycin-inducible biofilm formation inhibited exogenous gtp known inhibit c-di-gmp phosphodiesterase activity results demonstrate biofilm formation can specific defensive reaction presence antibiotics indicate molecular basis response includes alterations level c-di-gmp
