encoding electronic properties synthesis axial modulation-doped silicon nanowires 
describe successful synthesis modulation-doped silicon nanowires achieving pure axial elongation without radial overcoating growth process scanning gate microscopy shows key properties modulated structures-including number size period differentially doped regions-are defined controllable manner synthesis moreover feature sizes less nanometers possible electronic devices fabricated designed modulation-doped nanowire structures demonstrate potential lithography-independent address decoders tunable coupled quantum dots changes electronic properties encoded synthesis rather created conventional lithography-based techniques
