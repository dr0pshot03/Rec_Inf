recruitment antigen-specific cd8+ t cells response infection markedly efficient 
magnitude antigen-specific cd8+ t cell responses fixed correlates severity infection although definition t cell response size product capacity recruit naive t cells clonal selection subsequent proliferation clonal expansion remains undefined two factors regulate antigen-specific t cell responses determined relative contribution recruitment expansion labeling naive t cells unique genetic tags transferring mice disparate infection conditions different pathogens doses recruitment antigen-specific t cells near constant close complete thus naive t cell recruitment highly efficient magnitude antigen-specific cd8+ t cell responses primarily controlled clonal expansion
