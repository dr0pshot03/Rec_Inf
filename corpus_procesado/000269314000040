ink4/arf locus barrier ips cell reprogramming 
mechanisms involved reprogramming differentiated cells induced pluripotent stem ips cells three transcription factors oct4 also known pou5f1 klf4 sox2 remain poorly understood1 ink4/arf locus comprises cdkn2a cdkn2b genes encoding three potent tumour suppressors namely p16 ink4a p19 arf p15 ink4b basally expressed differentiated cells upregulated aberrant mitogenic signals- show locus completely silenced ips cells well embryonic stem es cells acquiring epigenetic marks bivalent chromatin domain retaining ability reactivated differentiation cell culture conditions reprogramming enhance expression ink4/arf locus highlighting importance silencing locus allow proliferation reprogramming indeed three factors together repress ink4/arf locus soon expression concomitant appearance first molecular markers stemness downregulation also occurs cells carrying oncoprotein large-t functionally inactivates pathways regulated ink4/arf locus thus indicating silencing locus intrinsic reprogramming result selective process genetic inhibition ink4/arf locus profound positive effect efficiency ips cell generation increasing kinetics reprogramming number emerging ips cell colonies murine cells arf rather ink4a main barrier reprogramming activation p53 encoded trp53 p21 encoded cdkn1a whereas human fibroblasts ink4a important arf furthermore organismal ageing upregulates ink4/arf locus accordingly reprogramming less efficient cells old organisms defect can rescued inhibiting locus short hairpin rna together conclude silencing ink4/arf locus rate-limiting reprogramming transient inhibition may significantly improve generation ips cells
