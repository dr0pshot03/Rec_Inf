light-driven changes energy metabolism directly entrain cyanobacterial circadian oscillator
circadian clocks self-sustained biological oscillators can entrained environmental cues although phenomenon studied many organisms molecular mechanisms entrainment remain unclear three cyanobacterial proteins adenosine triphosphate atp sufficient generate oscillations phosphorylation vitro show changes illumination induce phase shift cultured cyanobacteria also cause changes ratio atp adenosine diphosphate adp nucleotide changes simulated vitro oscillator cause phase shifts similar observed vivo physiological concentrations adp inhibit kinase activity oscillator mathematical model constrained data shows effect sufficient quantitatively explain entrainment cyanobacterial circadian clock
