experimental demonstration robust high-fidelity geometric two ion-qubit phase gate
universal logic gates two quantum bits qubits form essential ingredient quantum computation dynamical gates proposed context trapped ions however geometric phase gates change phase physical qubits offer potential practical advantages higher intrinsic resistance certain small errors might enable faster gate implementation demonstrate universal geometric pi-phase gate two beryllium ion-qubits based coherent displacements induced optical dipole force displacements depend internal atomic states motional state ions unimportant provided remain regime force can considered constant extent ions wave packet combining gate single-qubit rotations prepared ions entangled bell state % fidelity-about six times better previous experiment demonstrating universal gate two ion-qubits particular properties gate make attractive multiplexed trap architecture enable scaling large numbers ionqubits
