seismic detection lunar core
despite recent insight regarding history current state moon satellite sensing analyses limited apollo-era seismic data deficiencies remain understanding deep lunar interior reanalyzed apollo lunar seismograms using array-processing methods search presence reflected converted seismic energy core results suggest presence solid inner fluid outer core overlain partially molten boundary layer relative sizes inner outer core suggest core similar % liquid volume based phase diagrams iron alloys presence partial melt core probably contains less weight % lighter alloying components consistent volatile-depleted interior
