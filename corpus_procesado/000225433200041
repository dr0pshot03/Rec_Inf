nonlinear optics extreme ultraviolet
nonlinear responses optical field universal nature difficult observe extreme ultraviolet xuv soft x-ray regions owing lack coherent intense light sources high harmonic generation well-known nonlinear optical phenomenon now drawing much attention attosecond pulse generation- application high harmonics nonlinear optics xuv soft x-ray regime optical pulses large pulse energy short pulse duration achieve high optical electric field show generation intense isolated pulses single harmonic photon energy ev using sub--femtosecond blue laser pulse producing large dipole moment relatively low ninth harmonic order nonadiabatically xuv pulses pulse durations attoseconds femtoseconds characterized autocorrelation technique based two-photon above-threshold ionization helium atoms small cross-section above-threshold ionization autocorrelation measurement xuv pulses photon energy larger ionization energy helium hitherto demonstrated- technique can extended characterization higher harmonics shorter wavelengths
