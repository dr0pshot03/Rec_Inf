hierarchical porous polymer scaffolds block copolymers 
hierarchical porous polymer materials increasing importance potential application catalysis separation technology bioengineering examples synthesis exist need facile yet versatile conceptual approach hierarchical scaffolds quantitative characterization nonperiodic pore systems introduce synthesis method combining well-established concepts macroscale spinodal decomposition nanoscale block copolymer self-assembly porosity formation length scales via rinsing protic solvents used scanning electron microscopy small-angle x-ray scattering transmission electron tomography nanoscale x-ray computed tomography quantitative pore-structure characterization method demonstrated ab-and abc-type block copolymers resulting materials used scaffolds calcite crystal growth
