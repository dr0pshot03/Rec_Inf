climate change keystone predation biodiversity loss 
climate change can affect organisms directly via physiological stress indirectly via changing relationships among species however fully understand changing interspecific relationships contribute community ecosystem-level responses environmental forcing used experiments spatial temporal comparisons demonstrate warming substantially reduces predator-free space rocky shores vertical extent mussel beds decreased % years reproductive populations mussels disappeared several sites prey species able occupy hot extralimital site predation pressure experimentally reduced local species richness doubled result results suggest anthropogenic climate change can alter interspecific interactions produce unexpected changes species distributions community structure diversity
