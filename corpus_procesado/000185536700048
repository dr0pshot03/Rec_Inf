inactivation tnf signaling rationally designed dominant-negative tnf variants
tumor necrosis factor tnf key regulator inflammatory responses implicated many pathological conditions used structure-based design engineer variant tnf proteins rapidly form heterotrimers native tnf give complexes neither bind stimulate signaling tnf receptors thus tnf inactivated sequestration dominant-negative tnfs represent possible approach anti-inflammatory biotherapeutics experiments animal models show strategy can attenuate tnf-mediated pathology similar rational design used engineer inhibitors additional tnf superfamily cytokines well multimeric ligands
