microwave oscillations nanomagnet driven spin-polarized current
recent discovery spin-polarized electrical current can apply large torque ferromagnet direct transfer spin angular momentum offers possibility manipulating magnetic-device elements without applying cumbersome magnetic fields- however central question remains unresolved: type magnetic motions can generated torque theory predicts spin transfer may able drive nanomagnet types oscillatory magnetic modes attainable magnetic fields alone- existing measurement techniques provided indirect evidence dynamical states-- nature possible motions determined demonstrate technique allows direct electrical measurements microwave-frequency dynamics individual nanomagnets propelled dc spin-polarized current show spin transfer can produce several different types magnetic excitation although mechanical motion simple magnetic-multilayer structure acts like nanoscale motor converts energy dc electrical current high-frequency magnetic rotations might applied new devices including microwave sources resonators
