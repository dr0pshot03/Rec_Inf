clusters hyperactive neurons near amyloid plaques mouse model alzheimers disease
neurodegeneration observed alzheimers disease associated synaptic dismantling progressive decrease neuronal activity tested hypothesis vivo using two photon ca+ imaging mouse model alzheimers disease although decrease neuronal activity seen % layer / cortical neurons % neurons displayed unexpected increase frequency spontaneous ca+ transients hyperactive neurons found exclusively near plaques amyloid beta-depositing mice hyperactivity appeared due relative decrease synaptic inhibition thus suggest redistribution synaptic drive silent hyperactive neurons rather overall decrease synaptic activity provides mechanism disturbed cortical function alzheimers disease
