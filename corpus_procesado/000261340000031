efficient tumour formation single human melanoma cells 
fundamental question cancer biology whether cells tumorigenic potential common rare within human cancers studies diverse cancers including melanoma indicated rare human cancer cells % form tumours transplanted non obese diabetic/ severe combined immunodeficiency nod/ scid mice however extent nod/ scid mice underestimate frequency tumorigenic human cancer cells uncertain show modified xenotransplantation assay conditions including use highly immunocompromised nod/ scid interleukin receptor gamma chain null il2rg-/- mice can increase detection tumorigenic melanoma cells several orders magnitude limiting dilution assays approximately % unselected melanoma cells different patients including cells primary metastatic melanomas obtained directly patients formed tumours permissive conditions single cell transplants average % unselected melanoma cells four different patients formed tumours modifications xenotransplantation assays can therefore dramatically increase detectable frequency tumorigenic cells demonstrating common human cancers
