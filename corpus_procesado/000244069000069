glycoprotein g vesicular stomatitis virus triggers membrane fusion via low ph-induced structural rearrangement despite equilibrium pre postfusion states structure prefusion form determined angstrom resolution shows fusogenic transition entails extensive structural reorganization g comparison structure postfusion form suggests pathway conformational change prefusion form g shape tripod fusion loops exposed point toward viral membrane antigenic sites located distal end molecule large number g glycoproteins perhaps organized crystals act cooperatively induce membrane merging
