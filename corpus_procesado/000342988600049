helium lead isotopes reveal geochemical geometry samoan plume 
hotspot lavas erupted ocean islands exhibit tremendous isotopic variability indicating numerous mantle components hosted upwelling mantle plumes generate volcanism hotspots like hawaii samoa however known surface expression various geochemical components observed hotspot volcanoes relates spatial distribution within plume- present relationship pb isotopes samoan lavas places severe constraints distribution geochemical species within plume pb-isotopic compositions samoan lavas reveal several distinct geochemical groups corresponding different geographic lineament volcanoes group signature associated one four mantle end members low he-/he-:emiienriched mantle emienriched mantle himuhigh mu u-/pb- dmdepleted mantle critically four geochemical groups trend towards common region pb-isotopic space high he-/he- observation consistent several low-he-/he components plume mixing common high-he-/he component mixing much mixing relationships inferred new pb isotopic data provide clearest picture yet geochemical geometry mantle plume best explained high-he-/he plume matrix hosts mixes several distinct low-he-/he components
