warming antarctic ice-sheet surface since international geophysical year 
assessments antarctic temperature change emphasized contrast strong warming antarctic peninsula slight cooling antarctic continental interior recent decades1 pattern temperature change attributed increased strength circumpolar westerlies largely response changes stratospheric ozone2 picture however substantially incomplete owing sparseness short duration observations show significant warming extends well beyond antarctic peninsula cover west antarctica area warming much larger previously reported west antarctic warming exceeds degrees c per decade past years strongest winter spring although partly offset autumn cooling east antarctica continent wide average near surface temperature trend positive simulations using general circulation model reproduce essential features spatial pattern long term trend suggest neither can attributed directly increases strength westerlies instead regional changes atmospheric circulation associated changes sea surface temperature sea ice required explain enhanced warming west antarctica
