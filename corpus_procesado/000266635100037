origins modern human behavior marked increased symbolic technological complexity archaeological record western eurasia transition upper paleolithic occurred years ago many features appear transiently southern africa years earlier show demography major determinant maintenance cultural complexity variation regional subpopulation density and/or migratory activity results spatial structuring cultural skill accumulation genetic estimates regional population size time show densities early upper paleolithic europe similar sub-saharan africa modern behavior first appeared demographic factors can thus explain geographic variation timing first appearance modern behavior without invoking increased cognitive capacity
