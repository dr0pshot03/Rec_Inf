painful stimuli activate nociceptive c fibers induce synaptic long-term potentiation ltp spinal terminals ltp c-fiber synapses represents cellular model pain amplification hyperalgesia memory trace pain m-opioid receptor agonists exert powerful reversible depression c-fiber synapses renders continuous application low opioid doses gold standard pain therapy discovered brief application high opioid dose reversed various forms activity-dependent ltp c-fiber synapses depotentiation involved ca+-dependent signaling normalization phosphorylation state alpha-amino--hydroxy--methyl--isoxazolepropionic acid receptors also reversed hyperalgesia behaving animals opioids thus temporarily dampen pain may also erase spinal memory trace pain
