single-cell messenger rna sequencing reveals rare intestinal cell types 
understanding development function organ requires characterization cell types traditional methods visualizing isolating subpopulations cells based messenger rna protein expression known marker genes unequivocal identification specific marker gene however poses major challenge particularly cell type rare identifying rare cell types stem cells short-lived progenitors cancer stem cells circulating tumour cells crucial acquire better understanding normal diseased tissue biology address challenge first sequenced transcriptome hundreds randomly selected cells mouse intestinal organoids1 cultured self-organizing epithelial structures contain cell lineages mammalian intestine organoid buds like intestinal crypts harbour stem cells continuously differentiate variety cell types occurring widely different abundances2 since available computational methods can resolve abundant cell types developed raceid algorithm rare cell type identification complex populations single cells demonstrate algorithm can resolve cell types represented single cell population randomly sampled organoid cells use algorithm identify reg4 novel marker enteroendocrine cells rare population hormone-producing intestinal cells3 next use reg4 expression enrich rare cells investigate heterogeneity within population raceid confirmed existence known enteroendocrine lineages moreover discovered novel subtypes subsequently validated vivo validated raceid applied algorithm ex vivo-isolated lgr5-positive stem cells direct progeny find lgr5-positive cells represent homogenous abundant population stem cells mixed rare population lgr5-positive secretory cells envision broad applicability method discovering rare cell types corresponding marker genes healthy diseased organs
