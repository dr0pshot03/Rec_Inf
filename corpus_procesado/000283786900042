antibodies human serum amyloid p component eliminate visceral amyloid deposits 
accumulation amyloid fibrils viscera connective tissues causes systemic amyloidosis responsible one thousand deaths developed countries localized amyloid can also serious consequences example cerebral amyloid angiopathy important cause haemorrhagic stroke clinical presentations amyloidosis extremely diverse diagnosis rarely made significant organ damage present therefore major unmet need therapy safely promotes clearance established amyloid deposits different amyloid fibril proteins responsible different forms clinically significant amyloidosis treatments substantially reduce abundance respective amyloid fibril precursor proteins can arrest amyloid accumulation unfortunately control fibril-protein production possible forms amyloidosis others often slow hazardous therapy directly targets amyloid deposits enhanced clearance however amyloid deposits contain normal non-fibrillar plasma glycoprotein serum amyloid p component sap show administration anti-human-sap antibodies mice amyloid deposits containing human sap triggers potent complement-dependent macrophage-derived giant cell reaction swiftly removes massive visceral amyloid deposits without adverse effects anti-sap-antibody treatment clinically feasible circulating human sap can depleted patients bis-d-proline compound cphpc thereby enabling injected anti-sap antibodies reach residual sap amyloid deposits unprecedented capacity novel combined therapy eliminate amyloid deposits applicable forms systemic local amyloidosis
