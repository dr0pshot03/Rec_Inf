retinal ganglion cells act largely independent encoders
correlated firing among neurons widespread visual system neighbouring neurons areas retina cortex tend fire together often expected chance importance correlated firing encoding visual information unclear controversial- examine importance retina present retina natural stimuli record responses output cells ganglion cells use information theoretic techniques measure amount information stimuli can obtained cells two conditions: correlated firing taken account correlated firing ignored rnd % information stimuli can obtained cells correlated firing ignored indicates ganglion cells act largely independently encode information greatly simplifies problem decoding activity
