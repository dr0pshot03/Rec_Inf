presynaptic activity regulates na+ channel distribution axon initial segment 
deprivation afferent inputs neural circuits leads diverse plastic changes pre postsynaptic elements restore neural activity axon initial segment ais site neural signals arise efficient site regulate neural activity however none plasticity currently known involves ais report deprivation auditory input avian brainstem auditory neuron leads increase ais length thus augmenting excitability neuron length ais defined distribution voltage-gated na+ channels ais anchoring protein increased times seven days auditory input deprivation accompanied increase whole-cell na+ current membrane excitability spontaneous firing work demonstrates homeostatic regulation ais may contribute maintenance auditory pathway hearing loss furthermore plasticity spike initiation site suggests powerful pathway refining neuronal computation face strong sensory deprivation
