sex chromosome-linked species recognition evolution reproductive isolation flycatchers
interbreeding species hybridization typically produces unfit offspring reduced hybridization therefore favored natural selection however difficult accomplish hybridization also sets stage genetic recombination dissociate species-specific traits preferences show association maintained physical linkage chromosome two hybridizing ficedula flycatchers analyzing mating patterns female hybrids cross-fostered offspring demonstrate species recognition inherited z chromosome also known location species-specific male plumage traits genes causing low hybrid fitness limited recombination z chromosome maintains associations z-linked genes despite hybridization suggesting sex chromosomes may hotspot adaptive speciation
