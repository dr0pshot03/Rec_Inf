giant fluctuations coulomb drag bilayer system
coulomb drag system two parallel layers result electron-electron interaction layers observed reproducible fluctuations drag function magnetic field electron concentration manifestation quantum interference electrons layers low temperatures fluctuations exceed average drag giving rise random changes sign drag fluctuations found much larger previously expected propose model explains enhancement considering fluctuations local electron properties
