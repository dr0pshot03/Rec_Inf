climate events synchronize dynamics resident vertebrate community high arctic
recently accumulated evidence documented climate impact demography dynamics single species yet impact community level poorly understood show svalbard high arctic extreme weather events synchronize population fluctuations across entire community resident vertebrate herbivores cause lagged correlations secondary consumer arctic fox synchronization mainly driven heavy rain snow encapsulates vegetation ice blocks winter forage availability herbivores thus indirect bottom-up climate forcing drives population dynamics across overwintering vertebrates icing predicted become frequent circumpolar arctic may therefore strongly affect terrestrial ecosystem characteristics
