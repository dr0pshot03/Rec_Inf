ferroelectric control spin polarization 
current drawback spintronics large power usually required magnetic writing contrast nanoelectronics relies "zero-current" gate-controlled operations efforts made control spin-relaxation rate curie temperature magnetic anisotropy gate voltage effects usually small volatile used ferroelectric tunnel junctions ferromagnetic electrodes demonstrate local large nonvolatile control carrier spin polarization electrically switching ferroelectric polarization results represent giant type interfacial magnetoelectric coupling suggest low-power approach spin-based information control
