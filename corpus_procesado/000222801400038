surface transfer doping diamond
electronic properties many materials can controlled introducing appropriate impurities bulk crystal lattice process known doping way diamond well-known insulator can transformed semiconductor recent progress thin-film diamond synthesis sparked interest potential applications semiconducting diamond however high dopant activation energies excess ev limitation donor incorporation growth facets hampered development diamond-based devices report doping mechanism diamond using method require introduction foreign atoms diamond lattice instead c molecules evaporated onto hydrogen-terminated diamond surface induce subsurface hole accumulation significant rise two-dimensional conductivity observations bear resemblance so-called surface conductivity diamond- seen hydrogenated diamond surfaces exposed air support electrochemical model reduction hydrated protons aqueous surface layer gives rise hole accumulation layer expect transfer doping c will open broad vista possible semiconductor applications diamond
