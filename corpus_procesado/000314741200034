outburst massive star days supernova explosion
observations suggest massive stars experience extreme mass-loss episodes shortly explode supernovae- several models- establishing causal connection mass-loss episodes final explosion provide novel way study pre-supernova massive-star evolution report observations mass-loss event detected days explosion type iin supernova sn 2010mc also known ptf 10tel photometric spectroscopic data suggest event result energetic outburst radiating least x erg energy releasing - solar masses material typical velocities km s- temporal proximity mass-loss outburst supernova explosion implies causal connection moreover find outburst luminosity velocity consistent predictions wave-driven pulsation model disfavour alternative suggestions
