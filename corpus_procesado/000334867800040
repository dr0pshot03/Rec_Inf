conversion channelrhodopsin light-gated chloride channel 
field optogenetics uses channelrhodopsins chrs light-induced neuronal activation however optimized tools cellular inhibition moderate light levels lacking found replacement e90 central gate chr positively charged residues produces chloride-conducting chrs chlocs negligible cation conductance molecular dynamics modeling unveiled high-affinity cl--binding site generated near gate stabilizing open state dramatically increased operational light sensitivity expressing cells slow chloc ca1 pyramidal cells chlocs completely inhibited action potentials triggered depolarizing current injections synaptic stimulation thus inverting charge selectivity filter created class directly light-gated anion channels can used block neuronal output fully reversible fashion
