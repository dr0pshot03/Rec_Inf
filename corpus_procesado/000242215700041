superconductivity doped cubic silicon 
although local resistivity semiconducting silicon standard crystalline form can changed many orders magnitude doping elements superconductivity far never achieved hybrid devices combining silicons semiconducting properties superconductivity therefore remained largely underdeveloped report superconductivity can induced boron locally introduced silicon concentrations equilibrium solubility sufficiently high boron doping typically ppm silicon becomes metallic find higher boron concentration several per cent achieved gas immersion laser doping silicon becomes superconducting electrical resistivity magnetic susceptibility measurements show boron-doped silicon si:b made way superconductor transition temperature t-c approximate k critical field t ab initio calculations corroborated raman measurements strongly suggest doping substitutional calculated electron-phonon coupling strength found consistent conventional phonon-mediated coupling mechanism findings will facilitate fabrication new silicon-based superconducting nano-structures mesoscopic devices high-quality interfaces
