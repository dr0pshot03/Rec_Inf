ultra-high-q toroid microcavity chip 
circulation light within dielectric volumes enables storage optical power near specific resonant frequencies important wide range fields including cavity quantum electrodynamics photonics biosensing nonlinear optics- optical trajectories occur near interface volume surroundings making performance strongly dependent upon interface quality nearly atomic-scale surface finish surface-tension-induced microcavities liquid droplets spheres- superior dielectric microresonant structures comparing photon lifetime equivalently cavity q factor despite advantageous properties physical characteristics systems easily controlled fabrication known wafer-based processing resonators can achieve parallel processing control well integration functions however resonators-on-a-chip suffer q factors many orders magnitude lower surface-tension-induced microcavities making unsuitable ultra-high-q experiments demonstrate process producing silica toroid-shaped microresonators-on-a-chip q factors excess million using combination lithography dry etching selective reflow process high q value previously attainable droplets microspheres represents improvement nearly four orders magnitude previous chip-based resonators
