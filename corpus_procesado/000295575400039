resonances arising hydrodynamic memory brownian motion
observation brownian motion small probe interacting environment provides one main strategies characterizing soft matter- essentially two counteracting forces govern motion brownian particle first particle driven rapid collisions surrounding solvent molecules referred thermal noise second friction particle viscous solvent damps motion conventionally thermal force assumed random characterized gaussian white noise spectrum friction assumed given stokes drag suggesting motion overdamped long times particle tracking experiments inertia becomes negligible however particle receives momentum fluctuating fluid molecules also displaces fluid immediate vicinity entrained fluid acts back particle gives rise long-range correlations hydrodynamic memory translates thermal forces coloured non-white noise spectrum one hundred years perrins pioneering experiments brownian motion- direct experimental observation colour still elusive measure spectrum thermal noise confining brownian fluctuations microsphere strong optical trap show hydrodynamic correlations result resonant peak power spectral density spheres positional fluctuations strong contrast overdamped systems furthermore demonstrate different strategies achieve peak amplification analogy microcantilever-based sensors results reveal particle-fluid-trap system can considered nanomechanical resonator intrinsic hydrodynamic backflow enhances resonance therefore instead treated disturbance details thermal noise exploited development new types sensor particle-based assay lab-on-a-chip applications
