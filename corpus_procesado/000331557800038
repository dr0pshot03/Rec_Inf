evolutionarily dynamic alternative splicing gpr56 regulates regional cerebral cortical patterning
human neocortex numerous specialized functional areas whose formation poorly understood describe base pair deletion mutation regulatory element gpr56 selectively disrupts human cortex surrounding sylvian fissure bilaterally including brocas area primary language area disrupting regional gpr56 expression blocking rfx transcription factor binding gpr56 encodes heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding protein g protein-coupled receptor required normal cortical development expressed cortical progenitor cells gpr56 expression levels regulate progenitor proliferation gpr56 splice forms highly variable mice humans regulatory element gyrencephalic mammals directs restricted lateral cortical expression data reveal mechanism control gpr56 expression pattern multiple alternative promoters can influence stem cell proliferation gyral patterning potentially neocortex evolution
