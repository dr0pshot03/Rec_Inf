squeezing entanglement bose-einstein condensate 
entanglement key feature quantum mechanics resource allows improvement precision measurements beyond conventional bound attainable classical means results standard quantum limit reached todays best available sensors various quantities time position many sensors interferometers standard quantum limit can overcome using quantum-entangled states particular spin squeezed states two input ports bose-einstein condensates ultracold atoms considered good candidates provide states involving large number particles demonstrate spin squeezed states suitable atomic interferometry splitting condensate parts using lattice potential site-resolved detection atoms allows measurement atom number difference relative phase conjugate variables observed fluctuations imply entanglement particles- resource allow precision gain db standard quantum limit interferometric measurements
