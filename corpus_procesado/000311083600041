evidence dynamo main group pallasite parent body 
understanding origin pallasites stony-iron meteorites made mainly olivine crystals feni metal vexing problem since discovery show pallasite olivines host minute magnetic inclusions favorable magnetic recording properties paleointensity measurements indicate strong paleomagnetic fields suggesting dynamo action pallasite parent body use data thermal modeling suggest pallasites formed liquid feni core impactor injected dikes shallow mantle similar -kilometer-radius protoplanet protoplanet remained intact least several tens millions years olivine-metal mixing event
