dna segregation structures archaeal dna segregation machinery reveal bacterial eukaryotic linkages 
although recent studies provided wealth information archaeal biology nothing known molecular basis dna segregation organisms unveil machinery assembly mechanism archaeal sulfolobus pnob8 partition system system uses three proteins: para atypical parb adaptor centromere-binding component aspa aspa utilizes spreading mechanism create dna superhelix onto parb assembles supercomplex links para motor contains bacteria-like walker motif c domain parb harbors structural similarity cenpa dictates eukaryotic segregation thus archaeal system combines bacteria-like eukarya-like components suggests possible conservation dna segregation principles across three domains life
