early development ocular dominance columns
segregation lateral geniculate nucleus lgn axons ocular dominance columns believed involve prolonged activity-dependent sorting process however visualization early postnatal ferret lgn axons direct lgn tracer injections revealed segregated ocular dominance columns < days innervation layer early columns unaffected experimentally induced imbalances retinal activity implying different mechanisms govern initial column formation modification subsequent critical period instead activity-dependent plasticity propose ocular dominance column formation relies targeting distinct axonal populations defined locales cortical layer
