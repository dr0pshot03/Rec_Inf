vesicular glutamate transporters target functionally distinct synaptic release sites 
vesicular glutamate transporters vgluts show mutually exclusive distribution adult brain suggests specialization synapses different properties release consistent distribution inactivation vglut1 gene silenced subset excitatory neurons adult however cell populations exhibited vglut1-independent transmission early life developing hippocampal neurons transiently coexpressed vglut2 vglut1 distinct synaptic sites different short-term plasticity loss vglut1 also reduced reserve pool synaptic vesicles thus vglut1 plays unanticipated role membrane trafficking nerve terminal
