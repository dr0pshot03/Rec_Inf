magnetic domain-wall logic
spintronics spin charge electrons used logic memory operations promises alternate route traditional semiconductor electronics complete logic architecture can constructed uses planar magnetic wires less micrometer width logical logical signal fan-out signal cross-over elements simple geometric design can integrated together one circuit additional element data input allows information written domain-wall logic circuits
