weak pairwise correlations imply strongly correlated network states neural population 
biological networks many possible states exhaustive sampling impossible successful analysis thus depends simplifying hypotheses experiments many systems hint complicated higher-order interactions among large groups elements important role show vertebrate retina weak correlations pairs neurons coexist strongly collective behaviour responses ten neurons find collective behaviour described quantitatively models capture observed pairwise correlations assume higher-order interactions maximum entropy models equivalent ising models predict larger networks completely dominated correlation effects suggests neural code associative error-correcting properties provide preliminary evidence behaviour first test generality ideas show similar results obtained networks cultured cortical neurons
