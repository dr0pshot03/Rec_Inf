planet-planet scattering upsilon andromedae system 
doppler spectroscopy detected planets around nearby stars1 major puzzle many orbits highly eccentric; planets solar system nearly circular orbits expected formed accretion processes protostellar disk several mechanisms proposed generate large eccentricities planet formation far little observational evidence support particular model report current orbital configuration three giant planets around upsilon andromedae23 v probably results close dynamical interaction another planet4 now lost system planets started nearly circular orbits chaotic evolution caused outer planet v d perturbed suddenly higher-eccentricity orbit coupled evolution system causes slow periodic variations eccentricity middle planet v c indeed show v c periodically returns nearly circular state every years
