glycolipid antigen processing presentation cd1d molecules 
requirement processing glycolipid antigens t cell recognition examined mouse cd1d-mediated responses glycosphingolipids gsls although disaccharide gsl antigens can recognized without processing responses three antigens including disaccharide gsl galalpha1-->2galcer gal galactose; galcer galactosylceramide required removal terminal sugars permit interaction t cell receptor lysosomal enzyme alpha galactosidase responsible processing galalpha1-->2galcer generate antigenic monosaccharide epitope data demonstrate carbohydrate antigen processing system analogous used peptides ability t cells recognize processed fragments complex glycolipids
