anomalous weak magnetism superconducting yba2cu3o6+x
time now considerable experimental theoretical effort understand role normal-state pseudogap phase underdoped high-temperature cuprate superconductors recent debate centered question whether pseudogap independent superconductivity provide evidence zero-field muon spin relaxation measurements yba2cu3o6+x presence small spontaneous static magnetic fields electronic origin intimately related pseudogap transition significant finding optimal doping weak static magnetic fields appear well superconducting transition temperature two compositions measured suggest existence quantum critical point somewhat optimal doping
