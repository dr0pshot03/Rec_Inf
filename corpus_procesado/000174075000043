tyrannosaurus fast runner 
fastest gait speed largest theropod carnivorous dinosaurs tyrannosaurus controversial studies contend tyrannosaurus limited walking best m s- top speed1- whereas others argue least m s- running speeds5- demonstrate method gauging running ability estimating minimum mass extensor supportive muscle needed fast running models predictions validated living alligators chickens applying method small dinosaurs corroborates studies showing competent runners however models show order run quickly adult tyrannosaurus needed unreasonably large mass extensor muscle even generous assumptions therefore doubtful tyrannosaurus huge dinosaurs similar to6000 kg capable runners reach high speeds
