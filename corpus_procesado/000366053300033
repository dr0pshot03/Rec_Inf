immune homeostasis enforced co-localized effector regulatory t cells 
foxp3+ regulatory t cells t-reg cells prevent autoimmunity limiting effector activity t cells escaped thymic negative selection peripheral inactivation despite information available molecular factors mediating suppressive function t-reg cells relevant cellular events intact tissues remain largely unexplored whether treg cells prevent activation self-specific t cells primarily limit damage cells determined use multiplex quantitative imaging mice show within secondary lymphoid tissues highly suppressive treg cells expressing phosphorylated stat5 exist discrete clusters rare il--positive t cells activated self-antigens local il induction stat5 phosphorylation t-reg cells part feedback circuit limits autoimmune responses inducible ablation t cell receptor expression t-reg cells reduces regulatory capacity disrupts localization clusters resulting uncontrolled effector t cell responses data thus reveal autoreactive t cells activated cytokine production regular basis physically co-clustering t cell receptor-stimulated t-reg cells responding negative feedback manner suppress incipient autoimmunity maintain immune homeostasis
