bottom-up effects plant diversity multitrophic interactions biodiversity experiment 
biodiversity rapidly declining may negatively affect ecosystem processes including economically important ecosystem services previous studies shown biodiversity positive effects organisms processes across trophic levels however studies far incorporated explicit food-web perspective eight-year biodiversity experiment studied unprecedented range above-and below-ground organisms multitrophic interactions multitrophic data set originating single long-term experiment allows mechanistic insights gained meta-analysis different experiments show plant diversity effects dampen increasing trophic level degree omnivory true abundance species richness organisms furthermore present comprehensive above-ground/below-ground biodiversity food webs ground ground herbivores responded strongly changes plant diversity carnivores omnivores density richness carnivorous taxa independent vegetation structure below-ground responses plant diversity consistently weaker above-ground responses responses increasing plant diversity generally positive negative biological invasion pathogen infestation hyperparasitism results suggest plant diversity strong bottom-up effects multitrophic interaction networks particularly strong effects lower trophic levels effects higher trophic levels indirectly mediated bottom-up trophic cascades
