mechanism dna replication primer synthesis rna polymerase
rna primers dna replication usually synthesized specialized enzymes primases however replication systems evolved use cellular dna-dependent rna polymerase primer synthesis main requirement replication primer exposed rna end annealed dna template compatible known conformations transcription elongation complex raising question priming achieved show previously unrecognized kind transcription complex formed rna polymerase-catalysed synthesis m13 bacteriophage replication primer complex contains overextended rna dna hybrid bound rna-polymerase trough normally occupied downstream double-stranded dna thus leaving end rna available interaction dna polymerase transcription complexes similar topology may prime replication bacterial mobile elements may regulate transcription elongation conditions favour formation extended rna dna hybrid
