first pulse extremely bright grb 130427a: test lab synchrotron shocks
gamma-ray burst grb 130427a one energetic grbs ever observed initial pulse seconds possibly brightest well-isolated pulse observed date fine time resolution spectral analysis shows power-law decays peak energy onset pulse consistent models internal synchrotron shock pulses however strongly correlated power-law behavior observed luminosity spectral peak energy inconsistent curvature effects arising relativistic outflow difficult existing models account observed spectral temporal behaviors simultaneously
