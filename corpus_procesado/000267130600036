synapse stimulus-specific local translation long-term neuronal plasticity 
long-term memory synaptic plasticity require changes gene expression yet can occur synapse-specific manner messenger rna localization regulated translation synapses thus critical establishing synapse specificity using live-cell microscopy photoconvertible fluorescent protein translational reporters directly visualized local translation synapses long-term facilitation aplysia sensory-motor synapses translation reporter required multiple applications serotonin spatially restricted stimulated synapses transcript-and stimulus-specific occurred long-term facilitation long-term depression sensory-motor synapses translational regulation occurred presence chemical synapse required calcium signaling postsynaptic motor neuron thus highly regulated local translation occurs synapses long-term plasticity requires trans-synaptic signals
