actin spectrin associated proteins form periodic cytoskeletal structure axons
actin spectrin play important roles neurons organization axons dendrites remains unclear used stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy study organization actin spectrin associated proteins neurons actin formed ringlike structures wrapped around circumference axons evenly spaced along axonal shafts periodicity similar nanometers periodic structure observed dendrites instead contained long actin filaments running along dendritic shafts adducin actin-capping protein colocalized actin rings spectrin exhibited periodic structures alternating actin adducin distance adjacent actin-adducin rings comparable length spectrin tetramer sodium channels axons distributed periodic pattern coordinated underlying actin-spectrin-based cytoskeleton
