hedgehog signaling controls t cell killing immunological synapse 
centrosome essential cytotoxic t lymphocyte ctl function contacting plasma membrane directing cytotoxic granules secretion immunological synapse centrosome docking plasma membrane also occurs cilia formation primary cilium formed nonhematopoietic cells essential vertebrate hedgehog hh signaling lymphocytes form primary cilia found describe hh signaling played important role ctl killing t cell receptor activation prearms ctls cytotoxic granules also initiated hh signaling hh pathway activation occurred intracellularly triggered rac1 synthesis events prearmed ctls action promoting actin remodeling required centrosome polarization granule release thus hh signaling plays role ctl function immunological synapse may represent modified cilium
