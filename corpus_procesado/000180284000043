role highly conserved bacterial protein outer membrane protein assembly 
transport across cytoplasmic membrane bacterial outer membrane proteins assembled outer membrane meningococcal omp85 highly conserved protein gram-negative bacteria homolog toc75 component chloroplast protein-import machinery omp85 appeared essential viability unassembled forms various outer membrane proteins accumulated upon omp85 depletion immuno fluorescence microscopy revealed decreased surface exposure outer membrane proteins particularly apparent cell-division planes thus omp85 likely play role outer membrane protein assembly
