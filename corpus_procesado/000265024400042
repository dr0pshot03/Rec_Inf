running droplets gallium evaporation gallium arsenide 
high-temperature annealing gallium arsenide vacuum causes excess evaporation arsenic accumulation gallium liquid droplets surface using real-time situ surface electron microscopy found droplets spontaneously run across crystal surface running droplets seen many systems typically require special surface preparation gradient forces contrast show noncongruent evaporation automatically provides driving force running droplets motion predicted observed slow stop near characteristic temperature speed increasing temperature behavior expected occur evaporation similar iii-v semiconductors indium arsenide
