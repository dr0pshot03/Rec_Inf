antennal mechanosensors mediate flight control moths 
flying insects evolved sophisticated sensory capabilities achieve rapid course control aerial maneuvers among two-winged insects houseflies relatives hind wings modified club-shaped mechanosensory halteres detect coriolis forces thereby mediate flight stability maneuvers show mechanosensory input antennae serves similar role flight hawk moths four-winged insects antennae flying moths vibrate experience coriolis forces aerial maneuvers antennal vibrations transduced individual units johnstons organs base antennae frequency range characteristic coriolis input reduction mechanical input johnstons organs removing antennal flagellum moths severely disrupted flight stability reattachment flagellum restored flight control antennae thus play crucial role maintaining flight stability moths
