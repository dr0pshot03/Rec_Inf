molecular recognition selective oxygenation saturated c-h bonds dimanganese catalyst 
although enzymes often incorporate molecular recognition elements orient substrates selectively strategies rarely achieved synthetic catalysts combined molecular recognition hydrogen bonding c-h activation obtain high-turnover catalytic regioselective functionalization sp3 c-h bonds remote ccoh recognition group catalyst contains mnmu-o2mn reactive center ligand based kemps triacid directs cooh group anchor carboxylic acid group substrate thus modify usual selectivity oxidation control experiments supported rote hydrogen bonding orienting substrate achieve high selectivity
