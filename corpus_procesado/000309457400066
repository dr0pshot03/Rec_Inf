natural enemies drive geographic variation plant defenses 
plants defend attack natural enemies defenses vary widely across populations however whether communities natural enemies sufficiently potent force maintain polymorphisms defensive traits largely unknown exploit genetic resources arabidopsis thaliana coupled years field data aphid abundance demonstrate geographic patterns polymorphic defense locus gs-elong strongly correlated changes relative abundance two specialist aphids ii demonstrate differential selection two aphids gs-elong using multigeneration selection experiment thereby show causal link variation abundance two specialist aphids geographic pattern gs-elong highlights potency natural enemies selective forces
