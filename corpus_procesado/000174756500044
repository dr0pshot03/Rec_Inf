global disorder imprinting human female germ line 
imprinted genes expressed differently depending whether carried chromosome maternal paternal origin correct imprinting established germline-specific modifications; failure process underlies several inherited human syndromes1- imprinting control defects cis-acting disrupting establishment maintenance allele-specific epigenetic modifications across one contiguous segment genome contrast report inherited global imprinting defect recessive maternal-effect mutation disrupts specification imprints multiple non-contiguous loci result genes normally carrying maternal methylation imprint assume paternal epigenetic pattern maternal allele resulting conception phenotypically indistinguishable androgenetic complete hydatidiform mole6in abnormal extra-embryonic tissue proliferates development embryo absent nearly disorder offers genetic route identification trans-acting oocyte factors mediate maternal imprint establishment
