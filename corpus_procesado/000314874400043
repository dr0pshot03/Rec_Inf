observation radiation pressure shot noise macroscopic object
quantum mechanics position measurement macroscopic object typically inaccessible strong coupling environment classical noise work monitor mechanical resonator subject increasingly strong continuous position measurement observe quantum mechanical back-action force rises accordance heisenberg uncertainty limit optically based position measurements back-action takes form fluctuating radiation pressure poisson-distributed photons coherent measurement field termed radiation pressure shot noise demonstrate back-action force comparable magnitude thermal forces system additionally observe temporal correlation fluctuations radiation force position resonator
