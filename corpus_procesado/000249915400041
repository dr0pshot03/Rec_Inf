neuroligin mutation implicated autism increases inhibitory synaptic transmission mice 
autism spectrum disorders asds characterized impairments social behaviors sometimes coupled specialized cognitive abilities small percentage asd patients carry mutations genes encoding neuroligins postsynaptic cell-adhesion molecules introduced one mutations mice: arg-> cys r451c substitution neuroligin- r451c mutant mice showed impaired social interactions enhanced spatial learning abilities unexpectedly behavioral changes accompanied increase inhibitory synaptic transmission apparent effect excitatory synapses deletion neuroligin- contrast cause changes indicating r451c substitution represents gain-of-function mutation data suggest increased inhibitory synaptic transmission may contribute human asds r451c knockin mice may useful model studying autism-related behaviors
