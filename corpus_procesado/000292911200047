elf4-elf3-lux complex links circadian clock diurnal control hypocotyl growth
circadian clock required adaptive responses daily seasonal changes environmental conditions- light circadian clock interact consolidate phase hypocotyl cell elongation peak dawn diurnal cycles arabidopsis thaliana- identify protein complex called evening complex-composed proteins encoded early flowering elf3 elf4 transcription-factor-encoding gene lux arrhythmo lux also known phytoclock -that directly regulates plant growth- elf3 necessary sufficient form complex elf4 lux complex diurnally regulated peaking dusk elf3 elf4 lux required proper expression growth-promoting transcription factors encoded phytochrome interacting factor pif4 pif5 also known phytochrome interacting factor like diurnal conditions lux targets complex promoters pif4 pif5 vivo mutations pif4 and/or pif5 epistatic loss elf4-elf3-lux complex suggesting regulation pif4 pif5 crucial function complex therefore evening complex underlies molecular basis circadian gating hypocotyl growth early evening
