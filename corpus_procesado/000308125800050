synthesis methylphosphonic acid marine microbes: source methane aerobic ocean 
relative atmosphere much aerobic ocean supersaturated methane; however source important greenhouse gas remains enigmatic catabolism methylphosphonic acid phosphorus-starved marine microbes concomitant release methane suggested explain phenomenon yet methylphosphonate known natural product detected natural systems synthesis known natural products require unknown biochemistry show marine archaeon nitrosopumilus maritimus encodes pathway methylphosphonate biosynthesis produces cell-associated methylphosphonate esters abundance key gene pathway metagenomic data sets suggests methylphosphonate biosynthesis relatively common marine microbes providing plausible explanation methane paradox
