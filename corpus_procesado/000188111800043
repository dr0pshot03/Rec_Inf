posttranslational modifications proteins regulate many biological processes including metabolism signal transduction gene expression synthetic challenges associated generating homogeneous populations selectively modified proteins however hindered detailed studies effects modi cations protein structure function report approach cotranslational synthesis selectively glycosylated proteins modified amino acid genetically encoded show myoglobin containing beta-n-acetylglucosamine glcnac serine defined position can expressed escherichia coli good yield high fidelity beta-glcnac moiety can recognized saccharide-binding protein subsequently modified galactosyltransferase build complex carbohydrates approach generally applicable posttranslational modifications protein phosphorylation acetylation methylation
