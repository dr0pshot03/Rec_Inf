accelerated growth absence dna replication origins
dna replication initiates defined sites called origins serve binding sites initiator proteins recruit replicative machinery origins differ number structure across three domains life properties determine dynamics chromosome replication bacteria archaea replicate single origins whereas archaea eukaryotes replicate using multiple origins initiation mechanisms rely homologous recombination operate viruses show mechanisms also operate archaea use deep sequencing study replication haloferax volcanii identify four chromosomal origins differing activity deletion individual origins results perturbed replication dynamics reduced growth however strain lacking origins apparent defects grows significantly faster wild type origin-less cells initiate replication dispersed sites rather discrete origins absolute requirement recombinase rada unlike strains lacking individual origins results demonstrate homologous recombination alone can efficiently initiate replication entire cellular genome raises question purpose replication origins serve evolved
