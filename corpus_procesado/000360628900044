membrane fusion direct role sec1/munc18-family protein vps33 template snare assembly
fusion intracellular transport vesicles requires soluble n-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors snares sec1/munc18-family sm proteins membrane-bridging snare complexes critical fusion spontaneous assembly inefficient may require sm proteins vivo report x-ray structures vps33 sm subunit yeast homotypic fusion vacuole protein-sorting hops complex bound two individual snares two snares one membrane held correct orientation register subsequent complex assembly vps33 potentially sm proteins thus act templates generating partially zipped snare assembly intermediates hops essential mediate snare complex assembly physiological snare concentrations thus vps33 appears catalyze snare complex assembly specific snare motif recognition
