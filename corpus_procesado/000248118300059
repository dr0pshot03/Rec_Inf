rhythmic growth explained coincidence internal external cues
organisms use circadian oscillators coordinate physiological developmental processes growth predictable daily environmental changes like sunrise sunset importance coordination highlighted studies showing circadian dysfunction causes reduced fitness bacteria plants well sleep psychological disorders humans plant cell growth requires energy water-factors oscillate owing diurnal environmental changes indeed two important factors controlling stem growth internal circadian oscillator- external light levels however circadian studies performed constant conditions precluding mechanistic study interactions clock diurnal variation environment studies stem elongation diurnal conditions revealed complex growth patterns mechanism described- show growth phase arabidopsis seedlings diurnal light conditions shifted h relative plants continuous light describe mechanism underlying environmental response find clock regulates transcript levels two basic helix-loop-helix genes phytochrome-interacting factor pif4 pif5 whereas light regulates protein abundance genes function positive growth regulators coincidence high transcript levels clock protein accumulation dark allows promote plant growth end night thus two genes integrate clock light signalling coordinated regulation explains observed diurnal growth rhythms interaction may serve paradigm understanding endogenous environmental signals cooperate control processes
