detecting measuring cotranslational protein degradation vivo 
nascent polypeptides emerging ribosome yet folded may least transiently present degradation signals similar recognized ubiquitin system misfolded proteins ubiquitin sandwich technique used detect measure cotranslational protein degradation living cells percent nascent protein molecules bearing amino-terminal degradation signal can degraded cotranslationally never reaching mature size destruction processive proteolysis thus folding nascent proteins including abnormal ones may kinetic competition pathways target proteins degradation cotranslationally
