nitrogen fixation crucial maintaining biological productivity oceans replaces biologically available nitrogen lost denitrification owing temporal spatial variability global distribution marine nitrogen fixation difficult determine direct shipboard measurements uncertainty limits understanding factors influence nitrogen fixation may include iron nitrogen-to-phosphorus ratios physical conditions temperature determine nitrogen fixation rates worlds oceans impact nitrate phosphate concentrations surface waters using ocean circulation model results indicate nitrogen fixation rates highest pacific ocean water column denitrification rates high rate atmospheric iron deposition low conclude oceanic nitrogen fixation closely tied generation nitrogen-deficient waters denitrification zones supporting view nitrogen fixation stabilizes oceanic inventory fixed nitrogen time
