dimorphic pheromone circuit drosophila sensory input descending output 
drosophila show innate olfactory-driven behaviours observed naive animals without previous learning experience suggesting neural circuits mediate behaviours genetically programmed despite numerical simplicity fly nervous system features anatomical organization fly brain often confound delineation circuits identify neural circuit responsive cva pheromone elicits sexually dimorphic behaviours1- combined neural tracing using improved photoactivatable green fluorescent protein pa-gfp electrophysiology optical imaging laser-mediated microlesioning map circuit activation sensory neurons antennae excitation descending neurons ventral nerve cord circuit concise minimally comprises four neurons connected three synapses three neurons overtly dimorphic identify male-specific neuropil integrates inputs multiple sensory systems sends outputs ventral nerve cord neural pathway suggests means single pheromone can elicit different behaviours two sexes
