telomeres avoid end detection severing checkpoint signal transduction pathway 
telomeres protect normal ends chromosomes recognized deleterious dna double-strand breaks recent studies uncovered apparent paradox: although dna repair prevented several proteins involved dna damage processing checkpoint responses recruited telomeres every cell cycle required end protection currently understood telomeres prevent dna damage responses causing permanent cell cycle arrest show fission yeast schizosaccharomyces pombe cells lacking taz1 orthologue human trf1 trf2 ref recruit dna repair proteins rad22rad52 rhp51rad51 superscript indicates human orthologue checkpoint sensors rpa rad9 rad26atrip cut5/rad4topbp1 telomeres despite telomeres fail accumulate checkpoint mediator crb253bp1 consequently activate chk1-dependent cell cycle arrest artificially recruiting crb253bp1 taz1d telomeres results full checkpoint response cell cycle arrest stable association crb253bp1 dna double-strand breaks requires two independent histone modifications: h4 dimethylation lysine h4k20me2 h2a carboxy-terminal phosphorylation gamma h2a- whereas ch2a can readily detected telomeres lack h4k20me2 contrast internal chromosome locations blocking checkpoint signal transduction telomeres requires pot1 ccq1 loss either pot1 ccq1 telomeres leads crb253bp1 foci formation chk1 activation cell cycle arrest thus telomeres constitute chromatin-privileged region chromosomes lack essential epigenetic markers dna damage response amplification cell cycle arrest protein kinases atm atr must associate telomeres s phase recruit telomerase exclusion crb253bp1 critical role preventing telomeres triggering cell cycle arrest
