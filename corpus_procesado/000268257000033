asymmetric auroral intensities earths northern southern hemispheres
commonly assumed aurora borealis northern hemisphere aurora australis southern hemisphere mirror images charged particles causing aurora follow magnetic field lines connecting two hemispheres particles believed evenly distributed two hemispheres source region equatorial plane magnetosphere although shown similar auroral features opposite hemispheres can displaced tens degree longitude seasonal effects can cause differences global intensity overall auroral patterns still similar report observations clearly contradict common assumption symmetric aurora: intense spots seen dawn northern summer hemisphere dusk southern winter hemisphere asymmetry interpreted terms inter-hemispheric currents related seasons predicted hitherto seen
