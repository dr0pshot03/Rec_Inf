cryo-em model bullet-shaped vesicular stomatitis virus
vesicular stomatitis virus vsv bullet-shaped rhabdovirus model system negative-strand rna viruses direct visualization means cryo-electron microscopy show virion contains two nested left-handed helices: outer helix matrix protein m inner helix nucleoprotein n rna m hub domain four contact sites link neighboring m n subunits providing rigidity clamping adjacent turns nucleocapsid side-by-side interactions neighboring n subunits critical nucleocapsid form bullet shape structure-based mutagenesis results support description together data suggest mechanism vsv assembly nucleocapsid spirals tip become helical trunk subsequently framed rigidified m layer
