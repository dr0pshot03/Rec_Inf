nuclear argonaute promotes multigenerational epigenetic inheritance germline immortality
epigenetic information frequently erased near start new generation cases however epigenetic information can transmitted parent progeny multigenerational epigenetic inheritance particularly notable example type epigenetic inheritance double-stranded rna-mediated gene silencing caenorhabditis elegans rna-mediated interference rnai can inherited five generations- understand process conduct genetic screen nematodes defective transmitting rnai silencing signals future generations screen identified heritable rnai defective hrde- gene hrde encodes argonaute protein associates small interfering rnas germ cells progeny animals exposed double-stranded rna nuclei germ cells hrde engages nuclear rnai defective pathway direct trimethylation histone h3 lys h3k9me3 rnai-targeted genomic loci promote rnai inheritance normal growth conditions hrde associates endogenously expressed short interfering rnas direct nuclear gene silencing germ cells hrde- nuclear rnai-deficient animals germline silencing lost generational time concurrently animals exhibit steadily worsening defects gamete formation function ultimately lead sterility results establish argonaute protein hrde directs gene-silencing events germ-cell nuclei drive multigenerational rnai inheritance promote immortality germ-cell lineage propose c elegans use rnai inheritance machinery transmit epigenetic information accrued past generations future generations regulate important biological processes
