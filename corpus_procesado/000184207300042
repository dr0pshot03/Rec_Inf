evolution key cell signaling adhesion protein families predates animal origins
evolution animals unicellular ancestor involved many innovations choanoflagellates unicellular colonial protozoa closely related metazoa provide potential window early animal evolution found choanoflagellates express representatives surprising number cell signaling adhesion protein families previously isolated nonmetazoans including cadherins c-type lectins several tyrosine kinases tyrosine kinase signaling pathway components choanoflagellates complex dynamic tyrosine phosphoprotein pro le cell proliferation selectively affected tyrosine kinase inhibitors expression choanoflagellates proteins involved cell interactions metazoa demonstrates proteins evolved origin animals later co-opted development
