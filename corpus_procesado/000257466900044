internal thermal sensor controlling temperature preference drosophila
animals flies humans able distinguish subtle gradations temperature show strong temperature preferences- animals move environments optimal temperature manipulate temperature surroundings humans using clothing shelter despite ubiquitous influence environmental temperature animal behaviour neural circuits strategies animals select preferred temperature remain largely unknown identify small set warmth activated anterior cell ac neurons located drosophila brain function critical preferred temperature selection ac neuron activation occurs just flys preferred temperature depends dtrpa1 ion channel functions amolecular sensor warmth flies selectively express dtrpa1 ac neurons select normal temperatures whereas flies dtrpa1 function reduced eliminated choose warmer temperatures internal warmth sensing pathway promotes avoidance slightly elevated temperatures acts together distinct pathway cold avoidance set flys preferred temperature thus flies select preferred temperature using thermal sensing pathway tuned trigger avoidance temperatures deviate even slightly preferred temperature provides potentially general strategy robustly selecting narrow temperature range optimal survival
