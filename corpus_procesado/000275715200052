circadian gating cell cycle revealed single cyanobacterial cells
although major progress made uncovering machinery underlies individual biological clocks much less known multiple clocks coordinate oscillations simultaneously tracked cell division events circadian phases individual cells cyanobacterium synechococcus elongatus fit data model determine cell cycle progression slows function circadian cell cycle phases infer cell cycle progression cyanobacteria slows specific circadian interval uniform across cell cycle phases model applicable quantification coupling biological oscillators organisms
