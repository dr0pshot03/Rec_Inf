e2f contributes gene silencing manner independent retinoblastoma protein family members better elucidate molecular mechanism repression e2f- purified factor cultured cells e2f found multimeric protein complex contains mga max thus complex can bind e2f-binding site also myc brachyury-binding sites moreover complex contains chromatin modifiers novel histone methyltransferase modifies lysine histone h3 hp1gamma polycomb group pcg proteins e2f complex preferentially occupies target promoters g cells rather g cells data suggest chromatin modifiers contribute silencing e2f myc-responsive genes quiescent cells
