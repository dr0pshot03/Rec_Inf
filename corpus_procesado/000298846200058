dystroglycan function requires xylosyl glucuronyltransferase activities large
posttranslational modification alpha-dystroglycan alpha-dg like-acetylglucosaminyltransferase large required function extracellular matrix ecm receptor mutations large gene identified congenital muscular dystrophy patients brain abnormalities however precise function large remains unclear found large act bifunctional glycosyltransferase xylosyltransferase glucuronyltransferase activities produced repeating units [--xylose-alpha -glucuronic acid-beta ] modification allowed alpha-dg bind laminin-g domain-containing ecm ligands
