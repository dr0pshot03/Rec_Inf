demonstration entanglement electrostatically coupled singlet-triplet qubits 
quantum computers potential solve certain problems faster classical computers exploit power necessary perform interqubit operations generate entangled states spin qubits promising candidate implementing quantum processor potential scalability miniaturization however weak interactions environment lead long coherence times make interqubit operations challenging performed controlled two-qubit operation singlet-triplet qubits using dynamically decoupled sequence maintains two-qubit coupling decoupling qubit fluctuating environment using state tomography measured full density matrix system determined concurrence fidelity generated state providing proof entanglement
