compact stable efficient all-fibre gas cells using hollow-core photonic crystal fibres
gas-phase materials used variety laser-based applications example high precision frequency measurement quantum optics nonlinear optics full potential however realized lack suitable technology creating gas cells can guide light long lengths single transverse mode still offering high level integration practical compact set-up device result solid-phase materials still often favoured even performance compares unfavourably gas-phase systems report development all-fibre gas cells meet challenges structures based gas-filled hollow-core photonic crystal fibres recently demonstrated substantially enhanced stimulated raman scattering exhibit high performance excellent long-term pressure stability ease use illustrate practical potential structures report two different devices: hydrogen-filled cell efficient generation rotational raman scattering using quasi-continuous-wave laser pulses acetylene-filled cells use absolute frequency-locking diode lasers high signal-to-noise ratios stable performance compact gas-phase devices permit example gas-phase laser devices incorporated credit card even laser pointer
