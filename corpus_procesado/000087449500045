dynamics silicon surface phase transition 
manner phase transformations occur solids determines important structural physical properties many materials main problem characterizing kinetic processes occur phase transformations difficulty observing directly real time growth one phase expense another use low-energy electron microscopy study real-time kinetics phase transformation confined silicon surface show transformation governed rate material exchanged first layer crystal surface bulk phase transformations dynamics usually governed either rate diffusion material phase boundaries structural rearrangement atoms phase boundary1 kinetic process identified bulk analogue leads domain dynamics qualitatively different expected bulk systems
