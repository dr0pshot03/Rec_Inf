integrative genomics identifies mcu essential component mitochondrial calcium uniporter
mitochondria diverse organisms capable transporting large amounts ca+ via ruthenium-red-sensitive membrane-potential-dependent mechanism called uniporter- although uniporters biophysical properties studied extensively molecular composition remains elusive recently used comparative proteomics identify micu1 also known cbara1 ef-hand-containing protein serves putative regulator uniporter use whole-genome phylogenetic profiling genome-wide rna co-expression analysis organelle-wide protein coexpression analysis predict proteins functionally related micu1 three methods converge novel predicted transmembrane protein ccdc109a now call mitochondrial calcium uniporter mcu mcu forms oligomers mitochondrial inner membrane physically interacts micu1 resides within large molecular weight complex silencing mcu cultured cells vivo mouse liver severely abrogates mitochondrial ca+ uptake whereas mitochondrial respiration membrane potential remain fully intact mcu two predicted transmembrane helices separated highly conserved linker facing intermembrane space acidic residues linker required full activity however s259a point mutation retains function confers resistance ru360 potent inhibitor uniporter genomic physiological biochemical pharmacological data firmly establish mcu essential component mitochondrial ca+ uniporter
