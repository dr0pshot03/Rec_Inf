direct experimental evidence growing length scale accompanying glass transition
understanding glass formation challenge existence true glass state distinct liquid solid remains elusive: glasses liquids become viscous flow old idea yet unproven experimentally dynamics becomes sluggish glass transition approaches increasingly larger regions material move simultaneously allow flow introduce new multipoint dynamical susceptibilities estimate quantitatively size regions provide direct experimental evidence glass formation molecular liquids colloidal suspensions accompanied growing dynamic correlation length scales
