cerebral organoids model human brain development microcephaly 
complexity human brain made difficult study many brain disorders model organisms highlighting need vitro model human brain development developed human pluripotent stem cell-derived three-dimensional organoid culture system termed cerebral organoids develop various discrete although interdependent brain regions include cerebral cortex containing progenitor populations organize produce mature cortical neuron subtypes furthermore cerebral organoids shown recapitulate features human cortical development namely characteristic progenitor zone organization abundant outer radial glial stem cells finally use rna interference patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells model microcephaly disorder difficult recapitulate mice demonstrate premature neuronal differentiation patient organoids defect help explain disease phenotype together data show three-dimensional organoids can recapitulate development disease even complex human tissue
