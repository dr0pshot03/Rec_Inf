observing atomic collapse resonances artificial nuclei graphene 
relativistic quantum mechanics predicts charge superheavy atomic nucleus surpasses certain threshold resulting strong coulomb field causes unusual atomic collapse state state exhibits electron wave function component falls toward nucleus well positron component escapes infinity graphene charge carriers behave massless relativistic particles predicted highly charged impurities exhibit resonances corresponding atomic collapse states observed formation resonances around artificial nuclei clusters charged calcium dimers fabricated gated graphene devices via atomic manipulation scanning tunneling microscope energy spatial dependence atomic collapse state measured scanning tunneling microscopy revealed unexpected behavior occupied electrons
