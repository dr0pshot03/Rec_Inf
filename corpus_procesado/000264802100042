s-nitrosylation drp1 mediates beta-amyloid-related mitochondrial fission neuronal injury
mitochondria continuously undergo two opposing processes fission fusion disruption dynamic equilibrium may herald cell injury death may contribute developmental neurodegenerative disorders nitric oxide functions signaling molecule excess mediates neuronal injury part via mitochondrial fission fragmentation however underlying mechanism nitric oxide-induced pathological fission remains unclear found nitric oxide produced response beta-amyloid protein thought key mediator alzheimers disease triggered mitochondrial fission synaptic loss neuronal damage part via s-nitrosylation dynamin-related protein forming sno-drp1 preventing nitrosylation drp1 cysteine mutation abrogated neurotoxic events sno-drp1 increased brains human alzheimers disease patients may thus contribute pathogenesis neurodegeneration
