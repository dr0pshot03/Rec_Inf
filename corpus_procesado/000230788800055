crossover mesoscopic universal phase electron transmission quantum dots
measurement phase coherent electron systems-that mesoscopic systems quantum dots-can yield information fundamental transport properties readily apparent conductance measurements phase measurements relatively large quantum dots recently revealed phase evolution electrons traversing dots exhibits universal behaviour independent dot size shape electron occupancy specifically quantum dots coulomb blockade regime transmission phase increases monotonically pi throughout conductance peak conductance valleys phase returns sharply starting value expected mesoscopic features phase evolution-related dots shape spin degeneracy exchange effects-have observed present satisfactory explanation observed universality phase behaviour report results phase measurements series small quantum dots occupancies electrons phase behaviour electron transmission principle easier interpret contrast universal behaviour observed thus far larger dots see clear mesoscopic features phase measurements dot occupancy less similar electrons occupancy increases manner phase evolution changes universal behaviour recovered electrons identification transition expected mesoscopic behaviour universal phase evolution help direct constrain theoretical models latter
