dissecting genetic basis resistance malaria parasites anopheles gambiae
ability anopheles gambiae mosquitoes transmit plasmodium parasites highly variable individuals however genetic basis variability remained unknown combined genome-wide mapping reciprocal allele-specific rna interference rasrnai identify genomic locus confers resistance malaria parasites demonstrated polymorphisms single gene encoding antiparasitic thioester-containing protein tep1 explain substantial part variability parasite killing link tep1 alleles resistance malaria may offer new tools controlling malaria transmission successful application rasrnai anopheles suggests also applied organisms rnai feasible dissect complex phenotypes level individual quantitative trait alleles
