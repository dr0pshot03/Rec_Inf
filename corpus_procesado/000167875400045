genetic benefits shape good genes invoked explain costly female choice absence direct fitness benefits- little genetic variance fitness traits expected however directional selection tends drive beneficial alleles fixation- seems little potential therefore female choice result genetic benefits giving rise lek paradox- nevertheless evidence shows genetic variance persists despite directional selection genetic benefits female choice frequently reported theoretical solution lek paradox proposed basis two assumptions: traits condition-dependent condition shows high genetic variance observed genetic variability sexual traits will accounted proportion genetic variance condition will captured expressed trait report results experiments showing male courtship rate dung beetle onthophagus taurus condition-dependent trait preferred females importantly male condition high genetic variance genetically correlated courtship rate results thereby represent significant step towards resolution lek paradox
