sleep deprivation impairs camp signalling hippocampus
millions people regularly obtain insufficient sleep given effect sleep deprivation lives understanding cellular molecular pathways affected sleep deprivation clearly social clinical importance one major effects sleep deprivation brain produce memory deficits learning models dependent hippocampus- identified molecular mechanism brief sleep deprivation alters hippocampal function sleep deprivation selectively impaired -cyclic amp camp protein kinase pka-dependent forms synaptic plasticity mouse hippocampus reduced camp signalling increased activity protein levels phosphodiesterase pde4 enzyme degrades camp treatment mice phosphodiesterase inhibitors rescued sleep-deprivation-induced deficits camp signalling synaptic plasticity hippocampus-dependent memory findings demonstrate brief sleep deprivation disrupts hippocampal function interfering camp signalling increased pde4 activity thus drugs enhance camp signalling may provide new therapeutic approach counteract cognitive effects sleep deprivation
