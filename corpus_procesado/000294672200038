aeroelastic flutter produces hummingbird feather songs 
courtship flights males hummingbird species produce diverse sounds tail feathers varying shapes show sounds produced air flowing past feather causing aeroelastically flutter generate flutter-induced sound scanning laser doppler vibrometery high-speed video individual feathers different sizes shapes wind tunnel revealed multiple vibratory modes produce range acoustic frequencies harmonic structures neighboring feathers can aerodynamically coupled flutter either frequency resulting sympathetic vibrations increase loudness different frequencies resulting audible interaction frequencies aeroelastic flutter intrinsic stiff airfoils feathers thus explains tonal sounds common bird flight
