high-temperature ferromagnetism cab2c2
report high curie-temperature ferromagnet cab2c2 although compound neither transition metal rare earth ions ferromagnetic transition temperature t-c kelvin despite high t-c magnitude ordered moment room temperatures order - bohr magneton per formula unit properties rather similar doped divalent hexaborides ca1-xlaxb6 calculated electronic states also show similarity near fermi level cab2c2 divalent hexaborides however important difference: cab2c2 crystallizes tetragonal structure equivalent pockets energy bands electrons holes-in contrast cab6 thus disputed threefold degeneracy specific cubic structure energy bands divalent hexaborides turns essential high-temperature ferromagnetism peculiar molecular orbitals near fermi level appear crucial high-t-c ferromagnetism
