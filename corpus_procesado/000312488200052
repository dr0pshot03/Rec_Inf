quasi-cylindrical wave contribution experiments extraordinary optical transmission 
metal film perforated regular array subwavelength holes shows unexpectedly large transmission particular wavelengths phenomenon known extraordinary optical transmission eot metal hole arrays eot first attributed surface plasmon polaritons stimulating renewed interest plasmonics- metallic surfaces subwavelength features- experiments soon revealed field diffracted hole slit surface plasmon polariton mode alone8 theoretical analysis predicted extra contribution quasi-cylindrical waves- also affects eot report experimental demonstration relative importance surface plasmon polaritons quasi-cylindrical waves eot considering hole arrays different hole densities measured transmission spectra determine microscopic scattering parameters allow us show quasi-cylindrical waves affect eot high densities hole spacing roughly one wavelength apart providing deeper understanding eot determination microscopic scattering parameters measurement macroscopic optical properties paves way novel design strategies
