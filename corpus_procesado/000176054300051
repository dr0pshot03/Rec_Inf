dynamics thymocyte-stromal cell interactions visualized two-photon microscopy 
thymocytes selected mature according ability interact self major histocompatibility complex mhc-peptide complexes displayed thymic stroma using two-photon microscopy performed real-time analysis cellular contacts made developing thymocytes undergoing positive selection three-dimensional thymic organ culture large fraction thymocytes within cultures highly motile mhc recognition found increase duration thymocyte-stromal cell interactions occurred long-lived cellular associations displaying stable cell-cell contacts shorter highly dynamic contacts results identify diversity dynamics thymocyte interactions positive selection
