mx2 interferon-induced inhibitor hiv infection 
hiv replication can inhibited type interferon ifn expression number gene products anti-hiv activity induced type ifn1 however none known antiretroviral proteins can account ability type ifn inhibit early preintegration phases hiv replication cycle human cells comparing gene expression profiles cell lines differ ability support inhibitory action ifn-alpha early steps hiv replication cycle identify myxovirus resistance mx2 interferon-induced inhibitor hiv infection expression mx2 reduces permissiveness variety lentiviruses whereas depletion mx2 using rna interference reduces anti-hiv potency ifn-alpha hiv reverse transcription proceeds normally mx2-expressing cells long terminal repeat circular forms hiv dna less abundant suggesting mx2 inhibits hiv nuclear import destabilizes nuclear hiv dna consistent notion mutations hiv capsid protein known suspected alter nuclear import pathways used hiv confer resistance mx2 whereas preventing cell division increases mx2 potency overall findings indicate mx2 effector anti-hiv activity type-i ifn suggest mx2 inhibits hiv infection inhibiting capsid-dependent nuclear import subviral complexes
