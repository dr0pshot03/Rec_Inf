mutations pivotal functions onset genetic diseases fundamental substrate evolution however present estimates spontaneous mutation rate spectrum derived indirect biased measurements instance mutation rate estimates caenorhabditis elegans extrapolated observations genetic loci visible phenotypes vary order magnitude alternative approaches mammals relying phylogenetic comparisons pseudogene loci fourfold degenerate codon positions suffer uncertainties actual number generations separating compared species inability exclude biases associated natural selection provide direct unbiased estimate nuclear mutation rate molecular spectrum set c elegans mutation-accumulation lines reveal mutation rate tenfold higher previous indirect estimates excess insertions deletions deletions dominate patterns c elegans pseudogene variation observations indicate natural selection might significant promoting small genome size challenge prevalent assumption pseudogene divergence accurately reflects spontaneous mutation spectrum
