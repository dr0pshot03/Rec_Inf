sphingolipid transporter spns2 functions migration zebrafish myocardial precursors
sphingosine--phosphate s1p secreted lipid mediator functions vascular development however remains unclear s1p secretion regulated embryogenesis identified zebrafish mutant ko157 displays cardia bifida two hearts resembling s1p receptor mutant migration defect myocardial precursors ko157 mutant due mutation multipass transmembrane protein spns2 can rescued s1p injection show export s1p cells requires spns2 spns2 expressed extraembryonic tissue yolk syncytial layer ysl introduction spns2 mrna ysl restored cardiac defect ko157 mutant thus spns2 ysl functions s1p transporter s1p secretion thereby regulating myocardial precursor migration
