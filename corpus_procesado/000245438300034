global warming climate forcing recent albedo changes mars 
hundreds years scientists tracked changing appearance mars first hand drawings later photographs historical record many classical albedo patterns long known shift appearance time decadal variations martian surface albedo generally attributed removal deposition small amounts relatively bright dust surface large swaths surface million km observed darken brighten per cent more- unknown however albedo changes affect wind circulation dust transport feedback processes martian climate present predictions mars general circulation model indicating observed interannual albedo alterations strongly influence martian environment results indicate enhanced wind stress recently darkened areas decreased wind stress brightened areas producing positive feedback system albedo changes strengthen winds generate changes simulations also predict net annual global warming surface air temperatures similar k enhancing dust lifting increasing likelihood dust devil generation increase global dust lifting wind stress dust devils may affect mechanisms trigger large dust storm initiation poorly understood phenomenon unique mars addition predicted increases summertime air temperatures high southern latitudes contribute rapid steady scarp retreat observed south polar residual ice past four mars years- results suggest documented albedo changes affect recent climate change large-scale weather patterns mars thus albedo variations necessary component future atmospheric climate studies
