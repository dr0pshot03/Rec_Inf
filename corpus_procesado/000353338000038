life-threatening influenza impaired interferon amplification human irf7 deficiency
severe influenza disease strikes otherwise healthy children remains unexplained report compound heterozygous null mutations irf7 encodes transcription factor interferon regulatory factor otherwise healthy child suffered life-threatening influenza primary infection response influenza virus patients leukocytes plasmacytoid dendritic cells produced little type iii interferons ifns moreover patients dermal fibroblasts induced pluripotent stem cell ipsc-derived pulmonary epithelial cells produced reduced amounts type ifn displayed increased influenza virus replication findings suggest irf7-dependent amplification type iii ifns required protection primary infection influenza virus humans also show severe influenza may result single-gene inborn errors immunity
