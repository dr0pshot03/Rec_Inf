transgenic strategies combinatorial expression fluorescent proteins nervous system
detailed analysis neuronal network architecture requires development new methods present strategies visualize synaptic circuits genetically labelling neurons multiple distinct colours brainbow transgenes cre/lox recombination used create stochastic choice expression three fluorescent proteins xfps integration tandem brainbow copies transgenic mice yielded combinatorial xfp expression thus many colours thereby providing way distinguish adjacent neurons visualize cellular interactions demonstration reconstructed hundreds neighbouring axons multiple synaptic contacts one small volume cerebellar lobe exhibiting approximately colours expression lines also allowed us map glial territories follow glial cells neurons time vivo ability brainbow system label uniquely many individual cells within population may facilitate analysis neuronal circuitry large scale
