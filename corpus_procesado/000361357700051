cryo-em shows polymerase structures nonspooled genome within dsrna virus 
double-stranded rna dsrna viruses possess segmented dsrna genome number rna-dependent rna polymerases rdrps enclosed capsid now precise structures genomes rdrps within capsids unknown report structures rdrps associated rnas within nontranscribing transcribing cypoviruses ncpv tcpv respectively using combination cryo-electron microscopy cryo-em symmetry-mismatch reconstruction method rdrps associated rnas appear exhibit pseudo-d- symmetric organization ncpv tcpv however molecular interactions rdrps genomic rna found differ states work provides insight mechanisms replication transcription dsrna viruses paves way structural determination lower-symmetry complexes enclosed higher-symmetry structures
