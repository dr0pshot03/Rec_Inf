perovskite oxides visible-light-absorbing ferroelectric photovoltaic materials 
ferroelectrics recently attracted attention candidate class materials use photovoltaic devices coupling light absorption functional properties- materials strong inversion symmetry breaking due spontaneous electric polarization promotes desirable separation photo-excited carriers allows voltages higher bandgap may enable efficiencies beyond maximum possible conventional p-n junction solar cell- ferroelectric oxides also stable wide range mechanical chemical thermal conditions can fabricated using low-cost methods sol-gel thin-film deposition sputtering recent work shown decrease ferroelectric layer thickness judicious engineering domain structures ferroelectric-electrode interfaces can greatly increase current harvested ferroelectric absorber materials increasing power conversion efficiency - per cent improvements photovoltaic efficiency inhibited wide bandgaps electronvolts ferroelectric oxides allow use per cent solar spectrum describe family single-phase solid oxide solutions made low-cost non-toxic elements using conventional solid-state methods: [knbo3]-x[bani1/2nb1/2o3-delta]x kbnno oxides exhibit ferroelectricity wide variation direct bandgaps range - electronvolts particular x composition polar room temperature direct bandgap electronvolts photocurrent density approximately times larger classic ferroelectric pblazrtio material ability kbnno absorb three six times solar energy current ferroelectric materials suggests route viable ferroelectric semiconductor-based cells solar energy conversion applications
