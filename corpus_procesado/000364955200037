bidirectional notch signaling regulates drosophila intestinal stem cell multipotency
drosophila intestinal stem cells iscs generate enterocytes ecs enteroendocrine ee cells previous work suggests different levels notch ligand delta dl iscs unidirectionally activate notch daughters control multipotency however mechanisms driving different outcomes remain unknown found ee cell formation ee cell marker prospero localizes basal side dividing iscs asymmetric division ee daughter cell acts source dl induces low notch activity isc maintain identity alternatively iscs expressing dl induce high notch activity daughter cells promote ec formation data reveal conserved role notch drosophila mammalian isc maintenance suggest bidirectional notch signaling may regulate multipotency systems
