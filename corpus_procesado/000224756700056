plant cuticular lipid export requires abc transporter
waxy protective cuticle coats primary aerial plant tissues synthesis requires extensive export lipids epidermal cells plant surface arabidopsis cer5 mutants reduced stem cuticular wax loads accumulated sheetlike inclusions cytoplasm wax-secreting cells inclusions represented abnormal deposits cuticular wax resembled inclusions found human disorder caused defective peroxisomal adenosine triphosphate binding cassette abc transporter found cer5 gene encodes abc transporter localized plasma membrane epidermal cells conclude required wax export cuticle
