lrp4 retrograde signal presynaptic differentiation neuromuscular synapses 
motor axons receive retrograde signals skeletal muscle essential differentiation stabilization motor nerve terminals identification retrograde signals proved elusive production muscle depends receptor tyrosine kinase musk muscle skeletal receptor tyrosine-protein kinase lrp4 low-density lipoprotein receptor ldlr-related protein ldlr family member forms complex musk binds neural agrin stimulates musk kinase activity- show lrp4 also functions direct muscle-derived retrograde signal early steps presynaptic differentiation demonstrate lrp4 necessary independent musk activation presynaptic differentiation vivo show lrp4 binds motor axons induces clustering synaptic-vesicle active-zone proteins thus lrp4 acts bidirectionally coordinates synapse formation binding agrin activating musk stimulating postsynaptic differentiation functioning turn muscle-derived retrograde signal necessary sufficient presynaptic differentiation
