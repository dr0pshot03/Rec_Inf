periodically active pulsar giving insight magnetospheric physics 
psr + + behaves ordinary isolated radio pulsar active phases days long however radio emission ceases switches less seconds remains undetectable next days switches pattern repeats quasi-periodically origin behavior unclear even remarkably pulsar rotation slows % faster indicates massive increase magnetospheric currents pulsar switches proving pulsar wind plays substantial role pulsar spin-down allows us first time estimate magnetospheric currents pulsar magnetosphere occurrence radio emission
