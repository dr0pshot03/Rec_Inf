modelling myc inhibition cancer therapy
myc pleiotropic basic helix loop helix leucine zipper transcription factor coordinates expression diverse intracellular extracellular programs together necessary growth expansion somatic cells principle makes inhibition myc attractive pharmacological approach treating diverse types cancer however enthusiasm muted lack direct evidence myc inhibition therapeutically efficacious concerns induce serious side effects inhibiting proliferation normal tissues practical difficulties designing myc inhibitory drugs modelled genetically therapeutic impact side effects systemic myc inhibition preclinical mouse model ras induced lung adenocarcinoma reversible systemic expression dominant interfering myc mutant show myc inhibition triggers rapid regression incipient established lung tumours defining unexpected role endogenous myc function maintenance ras dependent tumours vivo systemic myc inhibition also exerts profound effects normal regenerating tissues however effects well tolerated extended periods rapidly completely reversible data demonstrate feasibility targeting myc common downstream conduit many oncogenic signals effective efficient tumour specific cancer therapy
