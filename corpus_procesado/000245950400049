species can maximize growth reproduction competitive ability across environments success invasive species habitat-dependent nutrient-rich habitats often experience invasion resource-poor habitats- pattern consistent traits generally associated successful invaders high growth rates early reproduction many offspring- however invaders colonize resource-poor environments mechanisms allow success systems poorly understood traits associated resource conservation widespread among species adapted resource-poor environments- invasive species may succeed low-resource environments employing resource conservation traits high resource-use efficiency rue carbon assimilation per unit resource investigated rue invasive native species three habitats hawaii light water nutrient availability limiting plant growth show across multiple growth forms broad taxonomic diversity invasive species generally efficient native species using limiting resources short timescales similarly efficient rue measures integrated leaf lifespans data challenge idea native species generally outperform invasive species conditions low resource availability suggest managing resource levels always effective strategy invasive species control
