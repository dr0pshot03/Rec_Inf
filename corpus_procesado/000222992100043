grain boundary-mediated plasticity nanocrystalline nickel 
plastic behavior crystalline materials mainly controlled nucleation motion lattice dislocations report situ dynamic transmission electron microscope observations nanocrystalline nickel films average grain size nanometers show grain boundary-mediated processes become prominent deformation mode additionally trapped lattice dislocations observed individual grains following deformation change deformation mode arises grain size-dependent competition deformation controlled nucleation motion dislocations deformation controlled diffusion-assisted grain boundary processes
