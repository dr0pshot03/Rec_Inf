mu transpososome structure sheds light dde recombinase evolution
studies bacteriophage mu transposition paved way understanding retroviral integration vdj recombination well many dna transposition reactions report structure mu transpososome-mu transposase mua complex bacteriophage dna ends target dna-determined data extend anisotropically angstrom angstrom angstrom resolution conjunction previously determined structures individual domains highly intertwined structure illustrates chemical activity depends formation synaptic complex reveals individual domains different roles bound different sites structure also provides explanations increased stability final product complex preferential recognition atp-dependent unfoldase clpx although mua many recombinases share structurally conserved dde catalytic domain comparisons among limited set available complex structures indicate conserved features catalysis trans target dna bending arose convergent evolution important function
