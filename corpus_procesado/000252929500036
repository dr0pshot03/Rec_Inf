updatable holographic three-dimensional display 
holographic three dimensional 3d displays provide realistic images without need special eyewear making valuable tools applications require situational awareness medical industrial military imaging currently commercially available holographic 3d displays use photopolymers lack image updating capability resulting restricted use high cost photorefractive polymers- dynamic holographic recording materials allow updating images wide range applications including optical correlation imaging scattering media optical communication suitable 3d displays photorefractive polymers need nearly % diffraction efficiency fast writing time hours image persistence rapid erasure large area combination properties shown report updatable holographic 3d display based photorefractive polymers properties capable recording displaying new images every minutes largest photorefractive 3d display date 4x4 inches size can recorded within minutes viewed several hours without need refreshing can completely erased updated new images desired
