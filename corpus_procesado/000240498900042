high gamma power phase-locked theta oscillations human neocortex
observed robust coupling high low-frequency bands ongoing electrical activity human brain particular phase low-frequency theta hertz rhythm modulates power high gamma hertz band electrocorticogram stronger modulation occurring higher theta amplitudes furthermore different behavioral tasks evoke distinct patterns theta/high gamma coupling across cortex results indicate transient coupling low high-frequency brain rhythms coordinates activity distributed cortical areas providing mechanism effective communication cognitive processing humans
