polony multiplex analysis gene expression pmage mouse hypertrophic cardiomyopathy 
describe sensitive mrna profiling technology pmage "polony multiplex analysis gene expression" detects messenger rnas mrnas rare one transcript per three cells pmage incorporates improved ligation-based method sequence -nucleotide tags derived individual mrna molecules one sequence tag mrna molecule amplified onto separate -micrometer bead denoted polymerase colony polony million polonies arrayed flow cell parallel sequencing using pmage identified early transcriptional changes preceded pathological manifestations hypertrophic cardiomyopathy mice carrying disease-causing mutation pmage provided comprehensive profile cardiac mrnas including low-abundance mrnas encoding signaling molecules transcription factors likely participate disease pathogenesis
