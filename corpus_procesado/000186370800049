crystal structure zinc-finger rna complex reveals two modes molecular recognition
zinc-finger proteins classical cyshis type frequently used class transcription factor account % genes human genome zinc-finger motif discovered biochemical studies transcription factor tfiiia regulates 5s ribosomal rna genes xenopus laevis zinc-fingers mostly interact dna tfiiia binds specifically promoter dna also 5s rna itself- increasing evidence indicates zinc-fingers widely used recognize rna- numerous structural studies dna binding none rna binding zinc-finger proteins report crystal structure three-finger complex bases rna derived central regions complete nine-finger tfiiia 5s rna complex structure reveals two modes zinc-finger binding differ common use dna: first zinc-fingers interact backbone double helix second zinc-fingers specifically recognize individual bases positioned access otherwise intricately folded loop regions rna
