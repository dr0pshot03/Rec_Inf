meis1 regulates postnatal cardiomyocyte cell cycle arrest 
neonatal mammalian heart capable substantial regeneration following injury cardiomyocyte proliferation however regenerative capacity lost postnatal day mechanisms cardiomyocyte cell cycle arrest remain unclear homeodomain transcription factor meis1 required normal cardiac development role cardiomyocytes unknown identify meis1 critical regulator cardiomyocyte cell cycle meis1 deletion mouse cardiomyocytes sufficient extension postnatal proliferative window cardiomyocytes re-activation cardiomyocyte mitosis adult heart deleterious effect cardiac function contrast overexpression meis1 cardiomyocytes decreased neonatal myocyte proliferation inhibited neonatal heart regeneration finally show meis1 required transcriptional activation synergistic cdk inhibitors p15 p16 p21 results identify meis1 critical transcriptional regulator cardiomyocyte proliferation potential therapeutic target heart regeneration
