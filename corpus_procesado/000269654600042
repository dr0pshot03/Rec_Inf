importance niches maintenance species diversity 
ecological communities characteristically contain wide diversity species important functional economic aesthetic value ecologists long questioned diversity maintained- classic theory shows stable coexistence requires competitors differ niches- motivated numerous investigations ecological differences presumed maintain diversity- niche differences key coexistence however recently challenged neutral theory biodiversity explains coexistence equivalence competitors ensuing controversy motivated calls better understanding collective importance niche differences diversity observed ecological communities integrate theory experimentation show niche differences collectively stabilize dynamics experimental communities serpentine annual plants used field-parameterized population models develop null expectation community dynamics without stabilizing effects niche differences population growth rates predicted null model varied several orders magnitude species sufficient rapid competitive exclusion moreover two generations community change field shannon diversity per cent greater communities stabilized niche differences relative exhibiting dynamics predicted null model finally experiment manipulating species relative abundances population growth rates increased species became rare-the demographic signature niche differences work thus provides strong evidence species differences critical role stabilizing species diversity
