fall earths magnetic field erratic 
earths magnetic field decayed % per century since measurements began directional measurements predate intensity years combined global model directions paleomagnetic intensity measurements estimate fall strength earlier period d found magnetic field strength nearly constant throughout time contrast later period extrapolating core surface showed fall strength originated patches reverse magnetic flux southern hemisphere patches detectable directional data alone pre model showed little evidence supporting conclusion steady dipole
