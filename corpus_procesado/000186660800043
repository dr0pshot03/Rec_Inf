group metabotropic glutamate receptors consisting mglur1 mglur5 g-protein-coupled neurotransmitter receptors found perisynaptic region postsynaptic membrane receptors activated single synaptic volleys rather require bursts activity- implicated many forms neural plasticity including hippocampal long-term potentiation depression- cerebellar long-term depression- associative learning cocaine addiction activated group mglurs engage two g-protein-dependent signalling mechanisms: stimulation phospholipase c activation unidentified mixed-cation excitatory postsynaptic conductance epsc displaying slow activation plasma membrane- report mglur1-evoked slow epsc mediated trpc1 cation channel trpc1 expressed perisynaptic regions cerebellar parallel fibre-purkinje cell synapse physically associated mglur1 manipulations interfere trpc1 block mglur1-evoked slow epsc purkinje cells however fast transmission mediated ampa-type glutamate receptors remains unaffected furthermore co-expression mglur1 trpc1 heterologous system reconstituted mglur1-evoked conductance closely resembles slow epsc purkinje cells
