au-: tetrahedral cluster 
photoelectron spectroscopy revealed atom gold cluster extremely large energy gap even greater c- electron affinity comparable c- observation suggests au cluster highly stable chemically inert using relativistic density functional calculations found au possesses tetrahedral structure fragment face-centered cubic lattice bulk gold small structural relaxation au thus unique molecule atomic packing similar bulk gold different properties
