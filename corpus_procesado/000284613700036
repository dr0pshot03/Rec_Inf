renewable chemical commodity feedstocks integrated catalytic processing pyrolysis oils
fast pyrolysis lignocellulosic biomass produces renewable liquid fuel called pyrolysis oil cheapest liquid fuel produced biomass today show pyrolysis oils can converted industrial commodity chemical feedstocks using integrated catalytic approach combines hydroprocessing zeolite catalysis hydroprocessing increases intrinsic hydrogen content pyrolysis oil producing polyols alcohols zeolite catalyst converts hydrogenated products light olefins aromatic hydrocarbons yield much three times higher produced pure pyrolysis oil yield aromatic hydrocarbons light olefins biomass conversion zeolite proportional intrinsic amount hydrogen added biomass feedstock hydroprocessing total product yield can adjusted depending market values chemical feedstocks relative prices hydrogen biomass
