accelerated speciation colour-polymorphic birds
colour polymorphism exemplifies extreme morphological diversity within populations taxonomically widespread generally rare theory suggests colour polymorphism occur processes generating maintaining can promote speciation generality claim unclear confirm using species-level molecular phylogenies five families non-passerine birds colour polymorphism associated accelerated speciation rates three groups polymorphism prevalent five groups colour polymorphism lost significantly greater rate gained thus general rarity phylogenetic dispersion colour polymorphism accounted combination higher speciation rate higher transition rate polymorphism monomorphism consistent theoretical models speciation driven fixation one morphs corroborated evidence species-level molecular phylogeny passerines incorporating % extant species polymorphic species tend younger monomorphic species results provide empirical support general proposition dating classical evolutionary theory- colour polymorphism can increase speciation rates
