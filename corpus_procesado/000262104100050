mott insulating state ultraclean carbon nanotubes
mott insulating state manifestation strong electron interactions nominally metallic systems using transport spectroscopy showed energy gap exists nominally metallic carbon nanotubes occurs addition band gap small band gap nanotubes indicating carbon nanotubes never metallic gap magnitude similar milli electron volts nanotube radius r dependence similar /r good agreement predictions nanotube mott insulating state also observed neutral excitations within gap predicted state results underscore nanotubes exceptional capabilities use studying correlated electron phenomena one dimension
