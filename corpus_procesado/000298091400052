tricarboxylic acid cycle cyanobacteria 
generally accepted cyanobacteria incomplete tricarboxylic acid tca cycle lack oxoglutarate dehydrogenase thus convert oxoglutarate succinyl-coenzyme coa genes encoding novel oxoglutarate decarboxylase succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase identified cyanobacterium synechococcus sp pcc together two enzymes convert oxoglutarate succinate thus functionally replace oxoglutarate dehydrogenase succinyl-coa synthetase genes present cyanobacterial genomes except prochlorococcus marine synechococcus species closely related genes occur genomes methanogens anaerobic bacteria also thought incomplete tca cycles
