gtp-dependent twisting dynamin implicates constriction tension membrane fission 
dynamin crucial factor endocytosis- member family gtpases participates membrane fission- initially proposed act machine constricts cuts neck nascent vesicles gtp-hydrolysis-dependent reaction subsequent studies suggested alternative models monitored effect nucleotides dynamin-coated lipid tubules real time addition gtp gdp gtp-gamma s resulted twisting tubules supercoiling suggesting rotatory movement helix turns relative gtp hydrolysis rotation confirmed movement beads attached tubules twisting activity produced longitudinal tension released tubule breakage ends tubule anchored fission also occurred dynamin gtp added lipid tubules generated liposomes motor activity kinesin microtubules fission events observed absence longitudinal tension findings demonstrate mechanoenzyme activity dynamin endocytosis also imply constriction sufficient fission short necks endocytic vesicles factors leading tension may cooperate constricting activity dynamin induce fission-
