protein insertion mitochondrial inner membrane twin-pore translocase 
mitochondrial inner membrane imports numerous proteins span multiple times using membrane potential deltapsi external energy source purified protein insertion complex tim22 complex twin-pore translocase mediated insertion precursor proteins three-step process precursor tethered translocase without losing energy deltapsi two energy-requiring steps needed first deltapsi acted precursor protein promoted docking translocase complex deltapsi internal signal peptide together induced rapid gating transitions one pore closing pore drove membrane insertion completion thus protein insertion driven coordinated action twin-pore complex two voltage-dependent steps
