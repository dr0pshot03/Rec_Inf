structural basis modular recognition single-stranded rna ppr proteins
pentatricopeptide repeat ppr proteins represent large family sequence-specific rna-binding proteins involved multiple aspects rna metabolism ppr proteins found exceptionally large numbers mitochondria chloroplasts terrestrial plants- recognize single-stranded rna ssrna modular fashion- maize chloroplast protein ppr10 binds two similar rna sequences atpi-atph psaj-rpl33 intergenic regions referred atph psaj respectively protecting target rna elements exonucleases ppr10 defines corresponding messenger rna termini- despite rigorous functional characterizations structural basis sequence-specific ssrna recognition ppr proteins remains elucidated report crystal structures ppr10 rna-free rna-bound states resolutions angstrom respectively absence rna binding nineteen repeats ppr10 assembled right-handed superhelical spiral ppr10 forms antiparallel intertwined homodimer exhibits considerable conformational changes upon binding target ssrna nucleotide psaj element six nucleotides psaj specifically recognized six corresponding ppr10 repeats following predicted code molecular basis specific modular recognition rna bases g u revealed structural elucidation rna recognition ppr proteins provides important framework potential biotechnological applications ppr proteins rna-related research areas
