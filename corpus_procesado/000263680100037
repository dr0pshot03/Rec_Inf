friction laws nanoscale 
macroscopic laws friction generally apply nanoscale contacts although continuum mechanics models predicted break nanoscale1 continue applied lack better theory understanding friction force depends applied load contact area scales essential design miniaturized devices optimal mechanical performance23 use large-scale molecular dynamics simulations realistic force fields establish friction laws dry nanoscale contacts show friction force depends linearly number atoms chemically interact across contact defining contact area proportional number interacting atoms show macroscopically observed linear relationship friction force contact area can extended nanoscale model predicts adhesion contacting surfaces reduced transition takes place nonlinear linear dependence friction force load transition consistent results several nanoscale friction experiments4- demonstrate breakdown continuum mechanics can understood result rough multi-asperity nature contact show roughness theories8- friction can applied nanoscale
