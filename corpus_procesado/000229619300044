anchorless prion protein results infectious amyloid disease without clinical scrapie 
prion alzheimers diseases roles played amyloid versus nonamyloid deposits brain damage remain unresolved scrapie-infected transgenic mice expressing prion protein prp lacking glycosylphosphatidylinositol gpi membrane anchor abnormal protease-resistant prpres deposited amyloid plaques rather usual nonamyloid form prpres although prpres amyloid plaques induced brain damage reminiscent alzheimers disease clinical manifestations minimal contrast combined expression anchorless wild-type prp produced accelerated clinical scrapie thus prp gpi anchor may play role pathogenesis prion diseases
