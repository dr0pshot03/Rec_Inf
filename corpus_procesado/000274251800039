abundance ribosomal rna gene copies maintains genome integrity 
ribosomal rna rdna gene repeats essential housekeeping genes found organisms gene amplification system maintains large clusters tandemly repeated copies chromosome species specific number copies yeast many untranscribed rdna copies extra copies found lost cells become sensitive dna damage induced mutagens show sensitivity dependent rdna transcriptional activity interferes cohesion rdna loci sister chromatids extra rdna copies facilitate condensin association sister-chromatid cohesion thereby facilitating recombinational repair results suggest high concentrations heavily transcribed genes toxic cells therefore amplified genes rdna evolved
