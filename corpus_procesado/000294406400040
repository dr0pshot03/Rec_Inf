synthetic biology: integrated gene circuits
major goal synthetic biology develop deeper understanding biological design principles bottom building circuits studying behavior cells investigators initially sought design circuits scratch functioned independently possible underlying cellular system recently researchers begun develop new generation synthetic circuits integrate closely endogenous cellular processes approaches providing fundamental insights regulatory architecture dynamics evolution genetic circuits enabling new levels control across diverse biological systems
