selective inhibition nf-kappa b activation peptide blocks interaction nemo kappa b kinase complex
activation transcription factor nuclear factor nf-kappa b proinflammatory stimuli leads increased expression genes involved inflammation activation nf-kappa b requires activity inhibitor kappa b kappa b-kinase ikk complex containing two kinases ikk alpha ikk beta regulatory protein nemo nf-kappa b essential modifier amino-terminal alpha-helical region nemo associated carboxyl-terminal segment ikk alpha ikk beta term nemo-binding domain nbd cell-permeable nbd peptide blocked association nemo ikk complex inhibited cytokine-induced nf-kappa b activation nf-kappa b-dependent gene expression peptide also ameliorated inflammatory responses two experimental mouse models acute inflammation nbd provides target development drugs block proinflammatory activation ikk complex without inhibiting basal nf-kappa b activity
