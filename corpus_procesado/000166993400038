human transcriptome map: clustering highly expressed genes chromosomal domains
chromosomal position human genes rapidly established integrated mapping data genome-wide messenger rna expression profiles provided sage serial analysis gene expression million sage transcript tags including tags neuroblastomas presently known tissue types developed algorithms assign tags unigene clusters chromosomal position resulting human transcriptome map generates gene expression profiles ant chromosomal region normal pathologic tissue types map reveals clustering highly expressed genes specific chromosomal regions provides tool search genes overexpressed silenced cancer
