improper ferroelectricity perovskite oxide artificial superlattices
ferroelectric thin films superlattices currently subject intensive research interest raise technological applications also properties fundamental scientific importance- ferroelectric superlattices allow tuning ferroelectric properties maintaining perfect crystal structure coherent strain even throughout relatively thick samples tuning achieved practice adjusting strain- enhance polarization composition interpolate properties combined compounds- show superlattices short periods possess new form interface coupling based rotational distortions gives rise improper ferroelectricity observations suggest approach based interface engineering produce artificial materials unique properties considering ferroelectric/paraelectric pbtio3/srtio3 multilayers first show first principles groundstate system purely ferroelectric also primarily involves antiferrodistortive rotations oxygen atoms way compatible improper ferroelectricity demonstrate experimentally contrast pure pbtio3 srtio3 compounds multilayer system indeed behaves like prototypical improper ferroelectric exhibits large dielectric constant epsilonrapproximate also fairly temperature-independent behaviour practical interest technological applications distinct normal ferroelectrics dielectric constant typically large strongly evolves around phase transition temperature also differs previously known improper ferroelectrics exhibit temperature-independent small dielectric constant
