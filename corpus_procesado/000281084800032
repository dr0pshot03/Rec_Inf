evidence recent thrust faulting moon revealed lunar reconnaissance orbiter camera 
lunar reconnaissance orbiter camera images reveal previously undetected lobate thrust-fault scarps associated meter-scale secondary tectonic landforms include narrow extensional troughs graben splay faults multiple low-relief terraces lobate scarps among youngest landforms moon based generally crisp appearance lack superposed large-diameter impact craters existence crosscut small-diameter impact craters identification previously known scarps limited high-resolution apollo panoramic camera images confined equatorial zone fourteen lobate scarps identified seven latitudes greater +/ degrees indicating thrust faults globally distributed detection coupled young apparent age faults suggests global late-stage contraction moon
