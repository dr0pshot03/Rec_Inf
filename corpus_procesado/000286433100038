supracolloidal reaction kinetics janus spheres 
clusters form aggregates small number elemental units display structural thermodynamic dynamic properties different bulk materials studied kinetic pathways self-assembly "janus spheres" hemispherical hydrophobic attraction found key differences characteristic molecular amphiphiles experimental visualization combined theory molecular dynamics simulation shows small kinetically favored isomers fuse equilibrate fibrillar triple helices six nearest neighbors per particle time scales colloidal rearrangement combined directional interactions resulting janus geometry make prototypical system elucidate mechanistic level single-particle kinetic resolution chemical anisotropy reaction kinetics coordinate generate highly ordered structures
