erythrocyte g protein-coupled receptor signaling malarial infection 
erythrocytic mechanisms involved malarial infection poorly understood found signaling via erythrocyte beta2-adrenergic receptor heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide binding protein galphas regulated entry human malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum agonists stimulate cyclic adenosine -monophosphate production led increase malarial infection blocked specific receptor antagonists moreover peptides designed inhibit galphas protein function reduced parasitemia p falciparum cultures vitro beta-antagonists reduced parasitemia p berghei infections vivo mouse model thus signaling via erythrocyte beta2-adrenergic receptor galphas may regulate malarial infection across parasite species
