reverse engineering giant muscle protein titin 
study single molecules become possible explain function many complex molecular assemblies found cells- protein titin provides muscle passive elasticity titin molecule extends half sarcomere extensibility studied situ- level single molecules- studies suggested titin simple entropic spring complex structure-dependent elasticity use protein engineering single-molecule atomic force microscopy examine mechanical components form elastic region human cardiac titin show mechanical elements combined explain macroscopic behaviour titin intact muscle studies show functional reconstitution protein sum parts
