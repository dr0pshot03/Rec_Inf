wnt7b mediates macrophage-induced programmed cell death patterning vasculature 
macrophages critical role inflammatory immune responses ability recognize engulf apoptotic cells show macrophages initiate cell-death programme target cells activating canonical wnt pathway show mice macrophage wnt7b short-range paracrine signal required wnt-pathway responses programmed cell death vascular endothelial cells temporary hyaloid vessels developing eye findings indicate macrophages can use wnt ligands influence cell-fate decisions including cell death adjacent cells raise possibility many different cellular contexts
