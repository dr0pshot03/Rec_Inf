reinforcement drives rapid allopatric speciation
allopatric speciation results geographic isolation populations absence gene flow reproductive isolation arises gradually incidentally result mutation genetic drift indirect effects natural selection driving local adaptation- contrast speciation reinforcement driven directly natural selection maladaptive hybridization gives individuals choose traits lineage greater fitness potentially leading rapid speciation lineages reinforcing natural selection population one lineages mosaic contact zone also result divergence population allopatric range lineage outside zone- test molecular data experimental crosses field measurements mate choice experiments mosaic contact zone two lineages rainforest frog show reinforcing natural selection resulted significant premating isolation population contact zone lineage also incidentally closely related main range lineage thus show potential reinforcement drive rapid allopatric speciation
