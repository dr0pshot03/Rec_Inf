giant-stroke superelastic carbon nanotube aerogel muscles 
improved electrically powered artificial muscles needed generating force moving objects accomplishing work carbon nanotube aerogel sheets sole component new artificial muscles provide giant elongations elongation rates % x % per second respectively operating temperatures kelvin solid-state-fabricated sheets enthalpic rubbers gaslike density specific strength one direction higher steel plate actuation decreases nanotube aerogel density can permanently frozen device applications transparent electrodes poissons ratios reach factor higher conventional rubbers giant poissons ratios explain observed opposite sign width length actuation result rare properties: negative linear compressibility stretch densification
