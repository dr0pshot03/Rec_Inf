non-radial oscillation modes long lifetimes giant stars 
towards end lives stars like sun greatly expand become red giant stars evolved stars provide stringent tests stellar theory many uncertainties internal stellar structure accumulate age important examples convective overshooting rotational mixing central hydrogen-burning phase determine mass helium core well understood principle analysis radial non-radial stellar oscillations can used constrain mass helium core although giants expected oscillate hitherto unclear whether non-radial modes observable red giants whether oscillation modes short long mode lifetime- determines observational precision frequencies report presence radial non-radial oscillations giant stars least giants mode lifetimes order month observe giant stars equally spaced frequency peaks fourier spectrum time series well giants spectrum seems complex satisfactory theoretical explanation currently exists observations
