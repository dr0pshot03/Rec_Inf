beta peptide vaccination prevents memory loss animal model alzheimers disease 
vaccinations amyloid-beta peptide ab can dramatically reduce amyloid deposition transgenic mouse model alzheimers disease1 determine vaccinations deleterious beneficial functional consequences tested eight months beta vaccination different transgenic model alzheimers disease mice develop learning deficits amyloid accumulates23 show vaccination beta protects transgenic mice learning age-related memory deficits normally occur mouse model alzheimers disease testing potential deleterious effects vaccine mice performed superbly radial-arm water-maze test working memory later age untreated transgenic mice show memory deficits beta vaccinated transgenic mice showed cognitive performance superior control transgenic mice ultimately performed well nontransgenic mice beta vaccinated mice also partial reduction amyloid burden end study therapeutic approach may thus prevent possibly treat alzheimers dementia
