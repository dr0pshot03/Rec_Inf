generation leaf shape early patterns growth tissue polarity
major challenge biology understand buds comprising cells can give rise complex plant animal appendages like leaves limbs address problem combination time-lapse imaging clonal analysis computational modeling arrive model shows leaf shape can arise feedback early patterns oriented growth tissue deformation experimental tests partial leaf ablation support model allow reevaluation previous experimental studies model allows range observed leaf shapes generated predicts observed clone patterns different species thus experimentally validated model may underlie development evolution diverse organ shapes
