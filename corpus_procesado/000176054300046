homologies leaf form inferred knoxi gene expression development
knottedi-like homeobox knoxi genes regulate development leaf shoot apical meristem sam may regulate leaf form examined knoxi expression sams various vascular plants found knoxi expression correlated complex leaf primordia however complex primordia may mature simple leaves therefore simple leaves develop similarly final leaf morphology may adequate predictor homology
