prediction emperor-hawaii seamount locations revised model global plate motion mantle flow 
bend hawaiian-emperor seamount chain prominent feature usually attributed change pacific plate motion similar to47 myr ago however global plate motion reconstructions fail predict bend show geometry hawaiian-emperor chain hotspot tracks can explained combine global plate motions intraplate deformation movement hotspot plumes distortion global mantle flow global mantle flow models predict southward motion hawaiian hotspot combination plate motion reconstruction connecting pacific african plates antarctica predicts hawaiian track correctly since date bend predicts chain far west reconstruction australia lord howe rise used instead track predicted correctly back 65myr ago including bend difference two predictions indicates effect intraplate deformation yet recognized else recorded ocean floor remaining misfit myr ago can attributed additional intraplate deformation similar magnitude
