learning induces long-term potentiation hippocampus 
years intensive investigation yielded sophisticated understanding long-term potentiation ltp induced hippocampal area ca1 high-frequency stimulation hfs efforts motivated belief similar synaptic modifications occur memory formation never shown learning actually induces ltp ca1 found one-trial inhibitory avoidance learning rats produced changes hippocampal glutamate receptors induction ltp hfs caused spatially restricted increase amplitude evoked synaptic transmission ca1 vivo learning-induced synaptic potentiation occluded hfs-induced ltp conclude inhibitory avoidance training induces ltp ca1
