secondary craters europa implications cratered surfaces 
several decades planetary researchers regarded impact crater populations solid-surfaced planets smaller bodies predominantly reflecting direct primary impacts asteroids comets estimates relative absolute ages geological units objects based assumption present analysis comparatively sparse crater population jupiters icy moon europa suggest assumption incorrect small craters find secondaries craters formed material ejected large primary impact craters comprise per cent small craters diameters less km europa therefore conclude large primary impacts solid surface example ice rock produce far secondaries previously believed implying small crater populations moon mars large bodies must dominated secondaries moreover results indicate small comets less m diameter passing jovian system recent times consistent dynamical simulations
