vital involvement natural killer cell activation receptor resistance viral infection 
natural killer nk cells lymphocytes can distinguished t b cells involvement innate immunity lack rearranged antigen receptors although nk cells receptors initially characterized terms tumor killing vitro determined nk cell activation receptor ly-49h critically involved resistance murine cytomegalovirus vivo ly-49h requires immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif itam-containing transmembrane molecule expression signal transduction thus nk cells use receptors functionally resembling itam-coupled t b cell antigen receptors provide vital innate host defense
