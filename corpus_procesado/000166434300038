non-detection venus high-frequency radio signals characteristic terrestrial lightning
detection impulsive low-frequency khz radio signals separate very-low-frequency similar hz radio whistler signals- provided first evidence lightning atmosphere venus later small number impulsive high-frequency khz mhz radio signals possibly due lightning also detected existence lightning venus however remained controversial- report results search high-frequency mhz radio signals two close fly-bys venus cassini spacecraft signals characteristic terrestrial lightning commonly heard amplitude-modulated radios thunderstorms although instrument easily detected signals terrestrial lightning later fly-by earth global flash rate estimated s- consistent rate expected terrestrial lightning similar signals detected venus lightning exists venusian atmosphere either extremely rare different terrestrial lightning
