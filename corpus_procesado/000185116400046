beta-arrestin mediates endocytosis type iii tgf-beta receptor down-regulation signaling 
beta-arrestins bind activated seven transmembrane-spanning 7tms receptors g protein-coupled receptors receptors phosphorylated g protein-coupled receptor kinases grks thereby regulating signaling internalization demonstrate unexpected analogous role beta-arrestin betaarr2 single transmembrane-spanning type iii transforming growth factor-beta tgf-beta receptor tbetariii also referred betaglycan binding betaarr2 tbetariii also triggered phosphorylation receptor cytoplasmic domain likely threonine however phosphorylation mediated type ii tgf-beta receptor tbetarii kinase rather grk association betaarr2 led internalization receptors down-regulation tgf-beta signaling thus regulatory actions beta-arrestins broader previously appreciated extending tgf-beta receptor family well
