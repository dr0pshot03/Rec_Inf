crossmodal interactions olfactory visual learning drosophila
different modalities sensation interact synergistic antagonistic manner sensory perception whether also interaction memory acquisition largely unknown drosophila reinforcement learning found conditioning concurrent visual olfactory cues reduced threshold unimodal memory retrieval furthermore bimodal preconditioning followed unimodal conditioning either visual olfactory cue led crossmodal memory transfer crossmodal memory acquisition drosophila may contribute significantly learning natural environment
