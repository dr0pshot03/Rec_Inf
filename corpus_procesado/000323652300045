intraflagellar transport ift ciliary precursors tubulin cytoplasm ciliary tip involved construction cilium hairlike organelle found eukaryotic cells however molecular mechanisms ift poorly understood found two core ift proteins ift74 ift81 form tubulin-binding module mapped interaction calponin homology domain ift81 highly basic domain ift74 knockdown ift81 rescue experiments point mutants showed tubulin binding ift81 required ciliogenesis human cells
