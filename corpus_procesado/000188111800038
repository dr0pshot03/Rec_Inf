siberian peatlands net carbon sink global methane source since early holocene
interpolar methane gradient ipg data ice cores suggest switching major northern hemisphere methane source early holocene extensive data russias west siberian lowland show explosive widespread peatland establishment thousand years ago predating comparable development north america synchronous increased atmospheric methane concentrations ipgs ii larger carbon stocks previously thought petagrams similar % terrestrial carbon accumulated since last glacial maximum iii little evidence catastrophic oxidation suggesting region represents long-term carbon dioxide sink global methane source since early holocene
