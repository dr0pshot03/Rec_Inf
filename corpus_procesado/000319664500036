enantio di aereodivergent dual catalysis: alpha-allylation branched aldehydes 
important challenge asymmetric synthesis development fully stereodivergent strategies access full complement stereoisomers products bearing multiple stereocenters ideal case four products possible applying distinct catalysts set starting materials identical conditions single step afford given stereoisomer herein describe realization concept fully stereodivergent dual-catalytic synthesis gammadelta-unsaturated aldehydes bearing vicinal quaternary/tertiary stereogenic centers reaction enabled chiral iridium amine catalysts activate allylic alcohol aldehyde substrates respectively catalyst exerts high local stereocontrol irrespective others inherent preference
