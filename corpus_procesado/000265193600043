reprogramming somatic cells pluripotency thereby creating induced pluripotent stem ips cells promises transform regenerative medicine instances direct reprogramming achieved forced expression defined factors using multiple viral vectors- however ips cells contain large number viral vector integrations one cause unpredictable genetic dysfunction whereas c-myc dispensable reprogramming complete elimination exogenous factors also desired ectopic expression either oct4 also known pou5f1 klf4 can induce dysplasia two transient transfection-reprogramming methods published address issue however efficiency approaches extremely low neither applied successfully human cells far show non-viral transfection single multiprotein expression vector comprises coding sequences c-myc klf4 oct4 sox2 linked 2a peptides can reprogram mouse human fibroblasts moreover transgene can removed reprogramming achieved ips cells produced nonviral vector show robust expression pluripotency markers indicating reprogrammed state confirmed functionally vitro differentiation assays formation adult chimaeric mice single-vector reprogramming system combined piggybac transposon succeeded establishing reprogrammed human cell lines embryonic fibroblasts robust expression pluripotency markers system minimizes genome modification ips cells enables complete elimination exogenous reprogramming factors efficiently providing ips cells applicable regenerative medicine drug screening establishment disease models
