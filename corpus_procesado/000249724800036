coupling superconducting qubits via cavity bus 
superconducting circuits promising candidates constructing quantum bits qubits quantum computer; single-qubit operations now routine12 several examples3- two-qubit interactions gates demonstrated experiments show two nearby qubits can readily coupled local interactions performing gate operations arbitrary pair distant qubits highly desirable quantum computer architecture yet demonstrated efficient way achieve goal couple qubits quantum bus distributes quantum information among qubits show implementation quantum bus using microwave photons confined transmission line cavity couple two superconducting qubits opposite sides chip interaction mediated exchange virtual rather real photons avoiding cavity-induced loss using fast control qubits switch coupling effectively demonstrate coherent transfer quantum states qubits cavity also used perform multiplexed control measurement qubit states approach can expanded two qubits attractive architecture quantum information processing chip
