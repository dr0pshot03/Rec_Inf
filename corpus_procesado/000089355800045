suppression mutations mitochondrial dna trnas imported cytoplasm
mitochondrial import cytoplasmic transfer rna trna yeast requires preprotein import machinery cytosolic factors investigated whether trna import pathway can used correct respirator deficiencies due mutations mitochondrial dna whether system can transferred human cells show cytoplasmic trnas altered aminoacylation identity can specifically targeted mitochondria participate mitochondrial translation also show human mitochondria normally import trnas able internalize yeast trna derivatives vitro import requires essential yeast import factor
