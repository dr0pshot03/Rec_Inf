energy input response prompt early optical afterglow emission gamma-ray bursts 
taxonomy optical emission detected critical first minutes onset gamma-ray burst grb defines two broad classes: prompt optical emission correlated prompt gamma-ray emission early optical afterglow emission uncorrelated gamma-ray emission standard theoretical interpretation attributes prompt emission internal shocks ultrarelativistic outflow generated internal engine- early afterglow emission attributed shocks generated interaction surrounding medium- report observations bright grb first time clearly show temporal relationship relative strength two optical components observations indicate early afterglow emission can understood reverberation energy input measured prompt emission measurements early afterglow reverberations therefore probe structure environment around burst whereas subsequent response late-time impulsive energy releases reveals earlier flaring episodes altered jet environment parameters many grbs generated death massive stars born died universe ten per cent current age grb afterglow reverberations provide clues environments around first stars
