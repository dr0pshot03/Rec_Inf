protein structures forming shell primitive bacterial organelles 
bacterial microcompartments primitive organelles composed entirely protein subunits genomic sequence databases reveal widespread occurrence microcompartments across diverse microbes prototypical bacterial microcompartment carboxysome protein shell sequestering carbon fixation reactions report three-dimensional crystal structures multiple carboxysome shell proteins revealing hexameric unit basic microcompartment building block showing hexamers assemble form flat facets polyhedral shell structures suggest molecular transport across shell may controlled structural variations might govern assembly architecture subcellular compartments
