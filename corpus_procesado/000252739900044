dbc1 negative regulator sirt1 
nad dependent protein deacetylase sir2 silent information regulator regulates lifespan several organisms- sirt1 mammalian orthologue yeast sir2 participates various cellular functions- possibly tumorigenesis whereas cellular functions sirt1 extensively investigated less known regulation sirt1 activity show deleted breast cancer dbc1 initially cloned region 8p21 homozygously deleted breast cancers forms stable complex sirt1 dbc1 directly interacts sirt1 inhibits sirt1 activity vitro vivo downregulation dbc1 expression potentiates sirt1 dependent inhibition apoptosis induced genotoxic stress results shed new light regulation sirt1 important implications understanding molecular mechanism ageing cancer
