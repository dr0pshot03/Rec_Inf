global topology analysis escherichia coli inner membrane proteome 
protein complement cellular membranes notoriously resistant standard proteomic analysis structural studies result membrane proteomes remain ill-defined report global topology analysis escherichia coli inner membrane proteome using c-terminal tagging alkaline phosphatase green fluorescent protein established periplasmic cytoplasmic locations c termini inner membrane proteins constraining topology prediction algorithm data derived high-quality topology models proteins providing firm foundation future functional studies membrane proteomes also estimated overexpression potential green fluorescent protein fusions; results suggest large fraction inner membrane proteins can produced sufficient quantities biochemical structural work
