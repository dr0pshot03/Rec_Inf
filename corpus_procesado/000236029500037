fuel-powered artificial muscles
artificial muscles electric motors found autonomous robots prosthetic limbs typically battery-powered severely restricts duration performance can necessitate long inactivity battery recharge help solve problems demonstrated two types artificial muscles convert chemical energy high-energy-density fuels mechanical energy first type stores electrical charge uses changes stored charge mechanical actuation contrast electrically powered electrochemical muscles half actuator cycle electrochemical second type fuel-powered muscle provides demonstrated actuator stroke power density comparable natural skeletal muscle generated stresses hundred times higher
