polyamine sensing nascent ornithine decarboxylase antizyme stimulates decoding mrna 
polyamines essential organic polycations multiple cellular functions relevant cell division cancer ageing- regulation polyamine synthesis mainly achieved controlling activity ornithine decarboxylase odc unusual mechanism involving odc antizyme binding disrupts homodimeric odc targets ubiquitin-independent degradation 26s proteasome whereas mammals express several antizyme genes identified single orthologue termed oaz1 saccharomyces cerevisiae similar mammalian counterparts oaz1 synthesis induced rising intracellular polyamine concentrations also inhibit ubiquitin-dependent degradation oaz1 protein together mechanisms contribute homeostatic feedback regulation polyamines antizyme synthesis involves conserved + ribosomal frameshifting rfs event internal stop codon decoding messenger rna- used s cerevisiae oaz1 dissect enigmatic mechanism underlying polyamine regulation rfs contrast previous assumptions report nascent antizyme polypeptide relevant polyamine sensor operates cis negatively regulate upstream rfs polysomes mrna translated low polyamine levels emerging antizyme polypeptide inhibits completion synthesis causing ribosome pile-up antizyme mrna whereas polyamine binding nascent antizyme promotes completion synthesis thus study reveals novel autoregulatory mechanism binding small metabolite nascent sensor protein stimulates latters synthesis co-translationally
