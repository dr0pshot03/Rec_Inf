cd40 agonists alter tumor stroma show efficacy pancreatic carcinoma mice humans 
immunosuppressive tumor microenvironments can restrain antitumor immunity particularly pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma pda cd40 activation can reverse immune suppression drive antitumor t cell responses tested combination agonist cd40 antibody gemcitabine chemotherapy small cohort patients surgically incurable pda observed tumor regressions patients reproduced treatment effect genetically engineered mouse model pda found unexpectedly tumor regression required macrophages t cells gemcitabine cd40-activated macrophages rapidly infiltrated tumors became tumoricidal facilitated depletion tumor stroma thus cancer immune surveillance necessarily depend therapy-induced t cells; rather findings demonstrate cd40-dependent mechanism targeting tumor stroma treatment cancer
