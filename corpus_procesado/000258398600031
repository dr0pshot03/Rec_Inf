fullerenes aromatic precursors surface-catalysed cyclodehydrogenation
graphite vaporization provides uncontrolled yet efficient means producing fullerene molecules however fullerene derivatives unusual fullerene species might accessible rational controlled synthesis methods recently approach used produce isolable amounts fullerene c commercially available starting materials overall process required steps generate suitable polycyclic aromatic precursor molecule dehydrogenated gas phase yield one per cent report formation c triazafullerene cn aromatic precursors using highly efficient surface-catalysed cyclodehydrogenation process find deposition onto platinum surface heating k precursors transformed corresponding fullerene triazafullerene molecules per cent yield expect approach will allow production range fullerenes heterofullerenes suitable precursors available also process carried atmosphere containing guest species might even allow encapsulation atoms small molecules form endohedral fullerenes
