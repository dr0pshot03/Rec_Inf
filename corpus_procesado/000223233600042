complex auditory behaviour emerges simple reactive steering 
recognition localization sound signals fundamental acoustic communication complex neural mechanisms thought underlie processing species-specific sound patterns even animals simple auditory pathways female crickets orient towards males calling song current models propose pattern recognition mechanisms based temporal structure song- furthermore thought localization achieved comparing output left right recognition networks directs female pattern closely resembles species-specific song- show using highly sensitive method measuring movements female crickets walking flying sound pulse communication signal releases rapid steering response thus auditory orientation emerges reactive motor responses individual sound pulses although reactive motor responses based song structure pattern recognition process may modulate gain responses longer timescale findings relevant concepts insect auditory behaviour development biologically inspired robots performing cricket-like auditory orientation-
