development pituitary development: regulatory codes mammalian organogenesis
mammalian pituitary gland development distinct cell types emerge common primordium appearance specific cell types occurs response opposing signaling gradients emanate distinct organizing centers signals induce expression interacting transcriptional regulators including dna binding-dependent activators dna binding-independent transrepressors temporally spatially overlapping patterns together synergistically regulate precursor proliferation induction distinct cell types terminal cell type differentiation requires selective gene activation strategies long-term active repression mediated cell type-specific promoter-specific recruitment coregulatory complexes mechanisms imply potential flexibility ultimate identity differentiated cell types
