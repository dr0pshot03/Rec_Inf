moesin functions antagonistically rho pathway maintain epithelial integrity
two prominent characteristics epithelial cells apical-basal polarity highly ordered cytoskeleton depend existence precisely localized protein complexes associated apical plasma membrane separate machinery regulates spatial order actin assembly erm ezrin radixin moesin proteins proposed link transmembrane proteins actin cytoskeleton apical domain suggesting structural role epithelial cells implicated signalling pathways show sole drosophila erm protein moesin functions promote cortical actin assembly apical-basal polarity result cells lacking moesin lose epithelial characteristics adopt invasive migratory behaviour data demonstrate moesin facilitates epithelial morphology providing essential structural function rather antagonizing activity small gtpase rho thus moesin functions maintaining epithelial integrity regulating cell-signalling events affect actin organization polarity furthermore results show negative feedback erm activation activity rho pathway
