reactive oxygen species causal role multiple forms insulin resistance
insulin resistance cardinal feature type diabetes characteristic wide range clinical experimental settings little known insulin resistance occurs many contexts various insults trigger insulin resistance act common mechanism suggested use distinct cellular pathways report genomic analysis two cellular models insulin resistance one induced treatment cytokine tumour-necrosis factor-alpha glucocorticoid dexamethasone gene expression analysis suggests reactive oxygen species ros levels increased models confirmed measures cellular redox state ros previously proposed involved insulin resistance although evidence causal role scant tested hypothesis cell culture using six treatments designed alter ros levels including two small molecules four transgenes ameliorated insulin resistance varying degrees one treatments tested obese insulin-resistant mice shown improve insulin sensitivity glucose homeostasis together findings suggest increased ros levels important trigger insulin resistance numerous settings
