drying-mediated self-assembly nanoparticles
systems far equilibrium can exhibit complex transitory structures even equilibrium fluctuations mundane dramatic example phenomenon recently demonstrated thin-film solutions passivated nanocrystals irreversible evaporation solvent- relatively weak attractions nanocrystals efficiently screened solution become manifest solvent evaporates initiating assembly intricate slowly evolving structures although certain aspects aggregation process can explained using thermodynamic arguments alone principle non-equilibrium process representation process arising phase separation dense nanocrystal liquid dilute nanocrystal vapour captures behaviour observed experiments neglects entirely role solvent fluctuations can considerable nanometre length scale present coarse-grained model nanoparticle self-assembly explicitly includes dynamics evaporating solvent simulations using model account observed spatial temporal patterns also predict network structures yet explored two distinct mechanisms ordering emerge corresponding homogeneous heterogeneous limits evaporation dynamics calculations show different choices solvent nanoparticle size identity thermodynamic state give rise various morphologies final structures resulting guide designing statistically patterned arrays nanoparticles suggests possibility fabricating spontaneously organized nanoscale devices
