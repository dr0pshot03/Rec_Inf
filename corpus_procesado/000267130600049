merkel cells essential light-touch responses 
peripheral nervous system detects different somatosensory stimuli including pain temperature touch merkel cell-neurite complexes touch receptors composed sensory afferents merkel cells role merkel cells play light-touch responses center controversy years used cre-loxp technology conditionally delete transcription factor atoh1 body skin foot pads mice merkel cells absent areas atoh1cko animals ex vivo skin/nerve preparations atoh1cko animals demonstrate complete loss characteristic neurophysiologic responses normally mediated merkel cell-neurite complexes merkel cells therefore required proper encoding merkel receptor responses suggesting cells form indispensible part somatosensory system
