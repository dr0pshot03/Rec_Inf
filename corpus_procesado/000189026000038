clarifying glass-transition behaviour water comparison hyperquenched inorganic glasses 
formation glasses normal substances remain liquid wide temperature range good glassformers can induced liquids cooling fast enough bypass crystallization reheating still melting point good glassformers exhibit glass transitions abruptly transform supercooled liquids whereas substances transform directly glassy crystalline state whether water exhibits glass transition crystallization much debated five decades- last years existence glass transition k ref widely accepted- transition exhibits qualities difficult reconcile current knowledge glass transitions report detailed calorimetric characterizations hyperquenched inorganic glasses heated crystallize reaching glass transition temperatures compare results behaviour glassy water find small endothermic effects one attributed glass transition water shadow real glass transition occurring higher temperatures thus substantiating conclusion glass transition water probed directly
