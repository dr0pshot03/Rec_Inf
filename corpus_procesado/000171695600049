lattice effects observed chaotic dynamics experimental populations 
animals many plants counted discrete units collection possible values state space population numbers thus nonnegative integer lattice despite fact many mathematical population models assume continuum system states complex dynamics chaos often displayed continuous-state models stimulated much ecological research; yet discrete-state models bounded population size can display cyclic behavior motivated data population experiment compared predictions discrete-state continuous-state population models neither discrete continuous-state models completely account data rather observed dynamics explained stochastic blending chaotic dynamics predicted continuous-state model cyclic dynamics predicted discrete-state models suggest lattice effects important component natural population fluctuations
