annexin ii light chain regulates sensory neuron-specific sodium channel expression
tetrodotoxin-resistant sodium channel nav/sns expressed exclusively sensory neurons appears important role pain pathways unlike sodium channels nav poorly expressed cell lines even presence accessory beta-subunits identify annexin ii light chain p11 regulatory factor facilitates expression nav p11 binds directly amino terminus nav promotes translocation nav plasma membrane producing functional channels endogenous nav current sensory neurons inhibited antisense downregulation p11 expression direct association p11 required functional expression nav disrupting interaction may useful new approach downregulating nav effecting analgesia
