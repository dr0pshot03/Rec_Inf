sustained microtubule treadmilling arabidopsis cortical arrays
plant cells create highly structured microtubule arrays cell cortex without central organizing center anchor microtubule ends vivo imaging individual microtubules arabidopsis plants revealed new microtubules initiated cell cortex exhibit dynamics ends polymerization-biased dynamic instability one end slow depolymerization end result sustained microtubule migration across cell cortex hybrid treadmilling mechanism motility causes widespread microtubule repositioning contributes changes array organization microtubule reorientation bundling
