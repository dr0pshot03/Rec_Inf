transformation temporal rate coding somatosensory thalamocortical pathway 
anatomical connections whiskers rodent somatosensory barrel cortex form two parallel lemniscal paralemniscal pathways unclear whether paralemniscal pathway directly involved tactile processing paralemniscal neuronal responses show poor spatial resolution labile latencies strong dependence cortical feedback- show paralemniscal system can transform temporally encoded vibrissal information rate code recorded representations frequency whisker movement along two pathways anaesthetized rats response varying stimulus frequencies lemniscal neurons exhibited amplitude modulations constant latencies contrast paralemniscal neurons thalamus cortex coded input frequency changes latency onset latencies increased offset latencies remained constant latency increments translated rate code: increasing onset latencies led lower spike counts thalamocortical loop includes cortical oscillations thalamic gating can account results thus variable latencies effective cortical feedback paralemniscal system can serve processing temporal sensory cues encode object location whisking contrast fixed time locking lemniscal system crucial reliable spatial processing
