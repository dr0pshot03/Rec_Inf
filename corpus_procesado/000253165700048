mouse model mitochondrial disease reveals germline selection severe mtdna mutations 
majority mitochondrial dna mtdna mutations cause human disease mild moderately deleterious yet many random mtdna mutations expected severe determine fate severe mtdna mutations introduced mtdnas containing two mutations affect oxidative phosphorylation female mouse germ line severe nd6 mutation selectively eliminated oogenesis within four generations whereas milder coi mutation retained throughout multiple generations even though offspring consistently developed mitochondrial myopathy cardiomyopathy thus severe mtdna mutations appear selectively eliminated female germ line thereby minimizing impact population fitness
