multi-colour organic light-emitting displays solution processing 
organic light-emitting diodes oleds show promise applications high-quality self-emissive displays portable devices cellular phones personal organizers1- although monochrome operation sufficient applications extension multi-colour devices-such rgb red green blue matrix displays-could greatly enhance technological impact multi-colour oleds successfully fabricated vacuum deposition small electroluminescent molecules solution processing larger molecules electroluminescent polymers result cheaper simpler manufacturing process however proved difficult combine solution processing approach high-resolution patterning techniques required produce pixelated display recent attempts focused modification standard printing techniques screen printing5- ink jetting8 still technical drawbacks report class electroluminescent polymers can patterned way similar standard photoresist materials-soluble polymers oxetane sidegroups can crosslinked photochemically produce insoluble polymer networks desired areas resolution process sufficient fabricate pixelated matrix displays consecutive deposition polymers luminescent three rgb colours yielded device efficiencies comparable state-of-the-art oleds even slightly reduced onset voltages
