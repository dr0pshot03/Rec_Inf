high-transition-temperature superconductivity absence magnetic-resonance mode 
fundamental mechanism gives rise high-transition-temperature high-t-c superconductivity copper oxide materials debated since discovery phenomenon recent work focused sharp kink kinetic energy spectra electrons possible signature force creates superconducting state- kink related magnetic resonance- also phonons report infrared spectra bi2sr2cacu2o8+delta bi- shows sharp feature can separated broad background interestingly weakens doping disappearing completely critical doping level holes per copper atom superconductivity still strong terms transition temperature doping t-c approximate k results rule magnetic resonance peak phonons principal cause high-t-c superconductivity broad background hand universal property copper-oxygen plane provides good candidate signature glue binds electrons
