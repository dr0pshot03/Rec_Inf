mutant motor protein kinesin moves directions microtubules 
molecular motors move directionally either plus minus end microtubules actin filaments kinesin moves towards microtubule plus ends whereas kinesin-related ncd motor moves minus ends neck-the region stalk motor domain-is required ncd move microtubule minus ends12 mechanism underlying directional motor movement understood show single amino-acid change ncd neck causes motor reverse directions move wild-type velocities towards plus minus end; thus neck functional directionality defective mutation motor-core residue touches neck residue crystal structures23 also results movement directions indicating directed movement minus end requires interactions neck motor core low-density laser-trap assays show conformational change working stroke ncd motor directional biased towards minus end whereas neck mutant occurs either direction conclude directional bias working stroke dependent neck/motor core interactions absence interactions removes directional constraints permits movement either direction
