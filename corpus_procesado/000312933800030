vast thin plane corotating dwarf galaxies orbiting andromeda galaxy
dwarf satellite galaxies thought remnants population primordial structures coalesced form giant galaxies like milky way previously suspected dwarf galaxies may isotropically distributed around galaxy several correlated streams h emission may form coplanar groups suspicions supported recent analyses- claimed apparently planar distribution satellites predicted within standard cosmology simply represent memory past coherent accretion however studies dispute conclusion- report existence planar subgroup satellites andromeda galaxy m comprising half population structure least kiloparsecs diameter also extremely thin perpendicular scatter less kiloparsecs radial velocity measurements- reveal satellites structure sense rotation host shows conclusively substantial numbers dwarf satellite galaxies share dynamical orbital properties direction angular momentum intriguingly plane identify approximately aligned pole milky ways disk vector milky way andromeda
