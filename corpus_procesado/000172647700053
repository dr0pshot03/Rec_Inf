central role cnga4 channel subunit ca2+-calmodulin-dependent odor adaptation 
heteromultimeric cyclic nucleotide-gated cng channels play central role transduction odorant signals subsequent adaptation contributions individual subunits native channel function olfactory receptor neurons remain unclear show targeted deletion mouse cnga4 gene encodes modulatory cng subunit results defect odorant-dependent adaptation channels excised membrane patches cnga4 null mouse exhibited slower ca2+-calmodulin-mediated channel desensitization thus cnga4 subunit accelerates ca2+-mediated negative feedback olfactory signaling allows rapid adaptation sensory system
