host-derived nitrate boosts growth e coli inflamed gut
changes microbial community structure observed individuals intestinal inflammatory disorders changes often characterized depletion obligate anaerobic bacteria whereas relative abundance facultative anaerobic enterobacteriaceae increases mechanisms host response shapes microbial community structure however remain unknown show nitrate generated by-product inflammatory response conferred growth advantage commensal bacterium escherichia coli large intestine mice mice deficient inducible nitric oxide synthase support growth e coli nitrate respiration suggesting nitrate generated inflammation host-derived thus inflammatory host response selectively enhances growth commensal enterobacteriaceae generating electron acceptors anaerobic respiration
