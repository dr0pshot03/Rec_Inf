inducing magnetic monopole topological surface states 
existence magnetic monopole compatible fundamental laws nature however elusive particle yet detected experimentally show theoretically electric charge near topological surface state induces image magnetic monopole charge due topological magneto-electric effect magnetic field generated image magnetic monopole may experimentally measured inverse square law field dependence can determined quantitatively propose effect can used experimentally realize gas quantum particles carrying fractional statistics consisting bound states electric charge image magnetic monopole charge
