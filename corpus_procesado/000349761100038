confining state light quantum manifold engineered two-photon loss 
physical systems usually exhibit quantum behavior superpositions entanglement sufficiently decoupled lossy environment paradoxically specially engineered interaction environment can become resource generation protection quantum states notion can generalized confinement system manifold quantum states consisting coherent superpositions multiple stable steady states confined state superconducting resonator quantum manifold spanned two coherent states opposite phases observed schrodinger cat state spontaneously squeeze vacuum decaying classical mixture experiment points toward robustly encoding quantum information inmultidimensional steady-state manifolds
