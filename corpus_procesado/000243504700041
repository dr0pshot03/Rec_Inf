seasonal characteristics indian ocean dipole holocene epoch 
indian ocean dipole iod oscillatory mode coupled ocean atmosphere variability causes climatic extremes socio-economic hardship throughout tropical indian ocean region- much debate iod interacts el nino/southern oscillation enso asian monsoon recent changes historic enso monsoon relationship raise possibility properties iod may also evolving improving understanding iod events climatic impacts thus requires development records defining iod activity different climatic settings including prehistoric times enso asian monsoon behaved differently present day use coral geochemical records equatorial eastern indian ocean reconstruct surface-ocean cooling drought individual iod events past similar years find iod events middle holocene characterized longer duration strong surface ocean cooling together droughts peaked later expected el nino forcing alone climate model simulations suggest enhanced cooling drying result strong cross-equatorial winds driven strengthened asian monsoon middle holocene iod monsoon connections imply socioeconomic impacts projected future changes asian monsoon strength may extend throughout australasia
