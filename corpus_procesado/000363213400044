ubiquitin facilitates quality-control pathway removes damaged chloroplasts 
energy production chloroplasts mitochondria causes constant oxidative damage functioning photosynthetic cell requires quality-control mechanisms turn degrade chloroplasts damaged reactive oxygen species ros generated conditionally lethal arabidopsis mutant accumulated excess protoporphyrin ix chloroplast produced singlet oxygen damaged chloroplasts subsequently ubiquitinated selectively degraded genetic screen identified plant u-box pub4 e3 ubiquitin ligase necessary process pub4- mutants defects stress adaptation longevity thus identified signal leads targeted removal ros-overproducing chloroplasts
