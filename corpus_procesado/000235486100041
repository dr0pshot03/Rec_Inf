counterfactual quantum computation quantum interrogation 
logic underlying coherent nature quantum information processing often deviates intuitive reasoning leading surprising effects counterfactual computation constitutes striking example: potential outcome quantum computation can inferred even computer run1 relying similar arguments interaction-free measurements2 quantum interrogation3 counterfactual computation accomplished putting computer superposition running running states interfering two histories conditional as-yet-unknown outcome computation sometimes possible counterfactually infer information solution demonstrate counterfactual computation implementing grovers search algorithm all-optical approach4 believed overall probability counterfactual inference intrinsically limited15 perform better average random guesses however using novel chained version quantum zeno effect6 show boost counterfactual inference probability unity thereby beating random guessing limit methods general apply physical system illustrated discussion trapped-ion systems finally briefly show certain circumstances counterfactual computation can eliminate errors induced decoherence
