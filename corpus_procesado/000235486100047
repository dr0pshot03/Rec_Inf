facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy mice overexpressing frg1 
facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy fshd autosomal dominant neuromuscular disorder due classical mutation within protein-coding gene instead almost fshd patients carry deletions integral number tandem -kilobase repeat units termed d4z4 located chromosome 4q35 ref d4z4 contains transcriptional silencer whose deletion leads inappropriate overexpression fshd skeletal muscle 4q35 genes located upstream d4z4 ref identify gene responsible fshd pathogenesis generated transgenic mice selectively overexpressing skeletal muscle 4q35 genes frg1 frg2 ant1 find frg1 transgenic mice develop muscular dystrophy features characteristic human disease contrast frg2 ant1 transgenic mice seem normal frg1 nuclear protein several lines evidence suggest involved pre-messenger rna splicing- find muscle frg1 transgenic mice fshd patients specific pre-mrnas undergo aberrant alternative splicing collectively results suggest fshd results inappropriate overexpression frg1 skeletal muscle leads abnormal alternative splicing specific pre-mrnas
