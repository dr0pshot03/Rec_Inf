origin gabaergic neurons human neocortex
mammalian neocortex contains two major classes neurons projection local circuit neurons- projection neurons contain excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate local circuit neurons inhibitory containing gaba complex function neocortical circuitry depends number diversity gabaergic gamma-aminobutyric-acid-releasing local circuit neurons- using retroviral labelling organotypic slice cultures embryonic human forebrain demonstrate existence two distinct lineages neocortical gabaergic neurons one lineage expresses dlx1/ mash1 transcription factors represents % neocortical gabaergic neurons humans originates mash1-expressing progenitors neocortical ventricular subventricular zone dorsal forebrain second lineage characterized expression dlx1/ mash1 forms around % gabaergic neurons originates ganglionic eminence ventral forebrain suggest modifications expression pattern transcription factors forebrain may underlie species-specific programmes generation neocortical local circuit neurons- distinct lineages cortical interneurons may differentially affected genetic acquired diseases human brain
