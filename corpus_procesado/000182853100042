attractor dynamics network states neocortex 
cerebral cortex receives input lower brain regions function traditionally considered processing input successive stages reach appropriate output however cortical circuit contains many interconnections including feeding back higher centres- continuously active even absence sensory inputs- spontaneous firing structure reflects coordinated activity specific groups neurons- moreover membrane potential cortical neurons fluctuates spontaneously resting depolarized state- may also coordinated elevated firing rate state follows sensory stimulation provides substrate persistent activity network state might mediate working memory- using two-photon calcium imaging reconstructed dynamics spontaneous activity neurons slices mouse visual cortex report occurrence synchronized state transitions cortical flashes occur spatially organized ensembles involving small numbers neurons stereotyped spatiotemporal dynamics conclude network states circuit attractors-emergent features feedback neural networks implement memory states solutions computational problems
