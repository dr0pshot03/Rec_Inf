first-photon imaging 
imagers use illumination can capture three-dimensional 3d structure reflectivity information photon-counting detectors images can acquired extremely low photon fluxes suppress poisson noise inherent low-flux operation imagers typically require hundreds detected photons per pixel accurate range reflectivity determination introduce low-flux imaging technique called first-photon imaging computational imager exploits spatial correlations found real-world scenes physics low-flux measurements technique recovers 3d structure reflectivity first detected photon pixel demonstrate simultaneous acquisition sub-pulse duration range -bit reflectivity information presence high background noise first-photon imaging may considerable value microscopy remote sensing
