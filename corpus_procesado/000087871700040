structural basis fracture toughness shell conch strombus gigas 
natural composite materials renowned mechanical strength toughness: despite highly mineralized organic component constituting per cent composite material fracture toughness exceeds single crystals pure mineral two three orders magnitude judicious placement organic matrix relative mineral phase hierarchical structural architecture extending several distinct length scales play crucial roles mechanical response natural composites external loads- use transmission electron microscopy studies beam bending experiments show resistance shell conch strombus gigas catastrophic fracture can understood quantitatively invoking two energy-dissipating mechanisms: multiple microcracking outer layers low mechanical loads crack bridging shells tougher middle layers higher loads mechanisms intimately associated so-called crossed lamellar microarchitecture shell provides channel cracking outer layers uncracked structural features bridge crack surfaces thereby significantly increasing work fracture hence toughness material despite high mineral content % volume aragonite shell strombus gigas can thus considered ceramic plywood can guide biomimetic design tough lightweight structures
