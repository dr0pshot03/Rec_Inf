biodegradation oil uplifted basins prevented deep-burial sterilization 
biodegradation crude oil bacterial activity-which occurred majority earths oil reserves-is known reduce greatly quality petroleum reservoirs economically successful prospecting oil therefore important understand processes conditions geological formations lead oil biodegradation although recent studies speculate bacterial activity can potentially occur temperatures high degreesc refs generally accepted effective petroleum biodegradation geological timescales generally occurs reservoirs temperatures degreesc ref appears however odds observation non-degraded oils can still found reservoirs temperature compile data regarding extent oil biodegradation several oil reservoirs rnd extensive occurrence non-biodegraded oil shallow cool basins restricted uplifted deeper hotter regions earth suggest petroleum reservoirs sterilized heating temperature around degreesc deep burial inactivating hydrocarbon-degrading organisms occur deep biosphere even reservoirs subsequently uplifted much cooler regions filled oil degradation occur implying sterilized sediments recolonized hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria
