combustion-free methodology synthesizing zeolites zeolite-like materials 
zeolites mainly used adsorption separation ions small molecules heterogeneous catalysts recently materials receiving attention applications medical diagnosis components electronic devices modern synthetic methodologies preparing zeolites zeolite-like materials typically involve use organic molecules direct assembly pathway ultimately fill pore space- removal enclathrated species normally requires high temperature combustion destroys high cost component associated energy release combination formed water can extremely detrimental inorganic structure report synthetic methodology avoids difficulties creating organic structure-directing agents sdas can disassembled within zeolite pore space allow removal fragments possible use reassembly methodology shown synthesis zeolite zsm using sda contains cyclic ketal group removed sda inside zeolite without destruction inorganic framework approach applicable synthesis wide variety inorganic organometallic structures
