olfactory plasticity regulated pheromonal signaling caenorhabditis elegans 
population density-dependent dispersal well-characterized strategy animal behavior dispersal rate increases population density higher caenorhabditis elegans shows positive chemotaxis set odorants chemotaxis switches attraction dispersal prolonged exposure odorants show plasticity olfactory behavior dependent population density regulation mediated pheromonal signaling show peptide suppressor nep- snet- negatively regulates olfactory plasticity expression down-regulated pheromone nep- homolog extracellular peptidase neprilysin antagonizes snet- function essential olfactory plasticity results suggest population density information transmitted external pheromone endogenous peptide signaling modulate chemotactic behavior
