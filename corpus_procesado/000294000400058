aneuploidy drives genomic instability yeast
aneuploidy decreases cellular fitness yet also associated cancer disease enhanced proliferative capacity investigate one mechanism aneuploidy contribute tumorigenesis examined effects aneuploidy genomic stability analyzed budding yeast strains carry extra copies single chromosomes found aneuploid strains exhibited one forms genomic instability strains displayed increased chromosome loss mitotic recombination well defective dna damage repair aneuploid fission yeast strains also exhibited defects mitotic recombination aneuploidy-induced genomic instability facilitate development genetic alterations drive malignant growth cancer
