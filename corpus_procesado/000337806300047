decoding regulatory landscape medulloblastoma using dna methylation sequencing 
epigenetic alterations disruption dna methylation chromatin architecture now acknowledged universal feature tumorigenesis medulloblastoma clinically challenging malignant childhood brain tumour exception despite much progress recent genomics studies recurrent changes identified four distinct tumour subgroupswnt-pathway-activated shh-pathway-activated less-well-characterized group group - many cases still lack obvious genetic driver present whole-genome bisulphite-sequencing data thirty-four human five murine tumours plus eight human three murine normal controls augmented matched whole-genome rna chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing data comprehensive data set allowed us decipher several features underlying interplay genome epigenome transcriptome effects medulloblastoma pathophysiology notable highly prevalent regions hypomethylation correlating increased gene expression extending tens kilobases downstream transcription start sites focal regions low methylation linked transcription-factor-binding sites shed light differential transcriptional networks subgroups whereas increased methylation due re-normalization repressed chromatin dna methylation valleys positively correlated gene expression large partially methylated domains affecting one-third genome showed increased mutation rates gene silencing subgroup-specific fashion epigenetic alterations also affected novel medulloblastoma candidate genes example lin28b resulting alternative promoter usage and/or differential messenger rna/microrna expression analysis mouse medulloblastoma precursor-cell methylation demonstrated somatic origin many alterations data provide insights epigenetic regulation transcription genome organization medulloblastoma pathogenesis probably also importance wider developmental disease context
