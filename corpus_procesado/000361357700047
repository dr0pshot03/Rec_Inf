x-ray-driven reaction front dynamics calcite-water interfaces
interface minerals aqueous solutions hosts globally important biogeochemical processes growth dissolution carbonate minerals understanding processes requires spatially temporally resolved observations experimental controls precisely manipulate interfacial thermodynamic state using intense radiation fields focused synchrotron x-ray beam drove dissolution calcite/water interface simultaneously probed dynamics propagating reaction fronts using surface x-ray microscopy evolving surface structures controlled time-dependent solution composition characterized kinetic reaction model extreme disequilibria observed onset reaction front instabilities velocities > nanometers per second instabilities serve signature transport-limited dissolution calcite extreme disequilibrium
