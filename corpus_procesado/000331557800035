designing collective behavior termite-inspired robot construction team
complex systems characterized many independent components whose low-level actions produce collective high-level results predicting high-level results given low-level rules key open challenge inverse problem finding low-level rules give specific outcomes present multi-agent construction system inspired mound-building termites solving inverse problem user specifies desired structure system automatically generates low-level rules independent climbing robots guarantee production structure robots use local sensing coordinate activity via shared environment demonstrate approach via physical realization three autonomous climbing robots limited onboard sensing work advances aim engineering complex systems achieve specific human-designed goals
