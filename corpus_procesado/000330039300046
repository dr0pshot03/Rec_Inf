different form color vision mantis shrimp 
one complex eyes animal kingdom can found species stomatopod crustaceans mantis shrimp different photoreceptor types sampling narrow set wavelengths ranging deep ultraviolet far red nanometers - functionally chromatic complexity presented mystery - use color channels three four sufficient fine color discrimination behavioral wavelength discrimination tests delta lambda functions stomatopods revealed surprisingly poor performance ruling color vision makes use conventional color-opponent coding system - instead experiments suggest stomatopods use previously unknown color vision system based temporal signaling combined scanning eye movements enabling type color recognition rather discrimination
