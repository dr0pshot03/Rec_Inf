synthetic homing endonuclease-based gene drive system human malaria mosquito 
genetic methods manipulating eradicating disease vector populations long discussed attractive alternative existing control measures potential advantages terms effectiveness species specificity- development genetically engineered malaria-resistant mosquitoes shown proof principle possibility targeting mosquitos ability serve disease vector- translation achievements control measures requires effective technology spread genetic modification laboratory mosquitoes field populations suggested previously homing endonuclease genes hegs class simple selfish genetic elements exploited purpose demonstrate synthetic genetic element consisting mosquito regulatory regions homing endonuclease gene i-scei- can substantially increase transmission progeny transgenic mosquitoes human malaria vector anopheles gambiae show i-scei element able invade receptive mosquito cage populations rapidly validating mathematical models transmission dynamics hegs molecular analyses confirm expression i-scei male germline induces high rates site-specific chromosomal cleavage gene conversion results gain i-scei gene underlies observed genetic drive findings demonstrate new mechanism genetic control measures can implemented results also show principle sequence-specific genetic drive elements like hegs used take step genetic engineering individuals genetic engineering populations
