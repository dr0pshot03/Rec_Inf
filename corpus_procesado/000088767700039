colorimetric sensor array odour visualization
array-based vapour-sensing devices used detect differentiate chemically diverse analytes systems based cross-responsive sensor elements-aim mimic mammalian olfactory system- producing composite responses unique odorant previous work concentrated variety non-specific chemical interactions- detect non-coordinating organic vapours odiferous toxic compounds often bind readily metal ions report simple optical chemical sensing method utilizes colour change induced array metalloporphyrin dyes upon ligand binding minimizing need extensive signal transduction hardware chemoselective response library immobilized vapour-sensing metalloporphyrin dyes permits visual identification wide range ligating alcohols amines ethers phosphines phosphites thioethers thiols even weakly ligating arenes halocarbons ketones vapours water geometrical correlation length consequently purely diffusive large-scale behaviour force therefore conclude results certainly applicable disordered packings cohesionless soils sand piles contrast particular case non-random textured packings biased long-range correlated q-series along force transmission tree likely encountered thus altering previous purely diffusive behaviour
