insect herbivores drive real-time ecological evolutionary change plant populations 
insect herbivores hypothesized major factors affecting ecology evolution plants tested prediction suppressing insects replicated field populations native plant oenothera biennis reduced seed predation altered interspecific competitive dynamics resulted rapid evolutionary divergence comparative genotyping phenotyping nearly o biennis individuals revealed plots protected insects resistance herbivores declined time owing changes flowering time lower defensive ellagitannins fruits whereas plant competitive ability increased independent real-time evolution plant resistance competitive ability field resulted relaxation direct selective effects insects plant defense indirect effects due reduced herbivory plant competitors
