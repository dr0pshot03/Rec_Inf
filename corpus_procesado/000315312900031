foxo3a directs protective autophagy program haematopoietic stem cells 
blood production ensured rare self-renewing haematopoietic stem cells hscs hscs accommodate diverse cellular stresses associated life-long activity remains elusive identify autophagy essential mechanism protecting hscs metabolic stress show mouse hscs contrast short-lived myeloid progeny robustly induce autophagy ex vivo cytokine withdrawal vivo calorie restriction demonstrate foxo3a critical maintain gene expression program poises hscs rapid induction autophagy upon starvation notably find old hscs retain intact foxo3a-driven pro-autophagy gene program ongoing autophagy needed mitigate energy crisis allow survival results demonstrate autophagy essential life-long maintenance hsc compartment supporting old failing blood system
