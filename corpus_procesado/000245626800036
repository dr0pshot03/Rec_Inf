rapid reversible shape changes molecular crystals photoirradiation
development actuators based materials reversibly change shape and/or size response external stimuli attracted interest time particularly intriguing possibility offered light-responsive materials allow remote operation without need direct contact actuator photo-response materials based photoisomerization constituent molecules typically trans cis isomerization azobenzene chromophores gives rise molecular motions thereby deforms bulk material effect used create light-deformable polymer films gels- response systems relatively slow report molecular crystals based diarylethene chromophores sizes ranging micrometres exhibit rapid reversible macroscopic changes shape size induced ultraviolet visible light find exposure ultraviolet light single crystal -bis-ethyl--phenyl--thienyl perfluorocyclopentene changes square shape lozenge shape whereas rectangular single crystal -bis-methyl--phenyl thiazolyl perfluorocyclopentene contracts per cent deformed crystals thermally stable switch back original state irradiation visible light find crystals respond microseconds five orders magnitude faster response time azobenzene-based polymer systems- can move microscopic objects making promising materials possible light-driven actuator applications
