natural anthropogenic variations methane sources past two millennia
methane important greenhouse gas emitted multiple natural anthropogenic sources atmospheric methane concentrations varied number time scales past caused variations always well understood- different sources sinks methane specific isotopic signatures isotopic composition methane can therefore help identify environmental drivers variations atmospheric methane concentrations present high-resolution carbon isotope data delta c content methane two ice cores greenland past two millennia find delta c content underwent pronounced centennial-scale variations bc ad help two-box model calculations show centennial-scale variations isotope ratios can attributed changes pyrogenic biogenic sources find correlations source changes natural climate variability-such medieval climate anomaly little ice age-and changes human population land use decline roman empire han dynasty population expansion medieval period
