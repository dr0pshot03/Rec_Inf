bayesian networks approach predicting protein-protein interactions genomic data
developed approach using bayesian networks predict protein-protein interactions genome-wide yeast method naturally weights combines reliable predictions genomic features weakly associated interaction eg messenger rna coexpression coessentiality colocalization addition de novo predictions can integrate often noisy experimental interaction data sets observe given levels sensitivity predictions accurate existing high-throughput experimental data sets validate predictions tap tandem affinity purification tagging experiments analysis gives comprehensive view yeast interactions available genecensusorg/intint
