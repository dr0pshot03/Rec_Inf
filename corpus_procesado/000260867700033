photosynthetic control atmospheric carbonyl sulfide growing season
climate models incorporate photosynthesis climate feedbacks yet lack robust tools large scale assessments processes recent work suggests carbonyl sulfide cos trace gas consumed plants provide valuable constraint photosynthesis analyze airborne observations cos carbon dioxide concentrations growing season north america three dimensional atmospheric transport model successfully modeled persistent vertical drawdown atmospheric cos using quantitative relation cos photosynthesis measured plant chamber experiments furthermore drawdown driven plant uptake rather continental oceanic fluxes model results provide quantitative evidence cos gradients continental growing season may broad use measurement based photosynthesis tracer
