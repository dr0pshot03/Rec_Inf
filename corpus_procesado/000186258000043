direct atom-resolved imaging oxides grain boundaries 
using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy obtained structure images strontium titanate srtio3 clearly resolved oxygen sublattice along different crystallographic directions bulk lattice sigma3 tilt grain boundary comparison image simulations showed grain boundary contains oxygen vacancies measurements atom displacements near grain boundary revealed close correspondence theoretical calculations
