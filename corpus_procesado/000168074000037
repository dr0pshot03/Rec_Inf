single-molecule studies heterogeneous dynamics polymer melts near class transition retracted article see vol pg 
single-molecule spectroscopy used follow orientation single probe molecule polymer film real time broad spatially heterogeneous dynamics observed long time scales result simple diffusive rotational motions short time scales diffusive behavior persists many rotations molecules local environment changes one characterized new time scale environmental exchange occurs instantaneously time scale experiment may arise large-scale collective motions distribution exchange times environments measured several temperatures near glass transition
