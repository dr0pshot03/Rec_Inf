interpretation sonic hedgehog morphogen gradient temporal adaptation mechanism 
morphogens act developing tissues control spatial arrangement cellular differentiation activity morphogen generally viewed concentration-dependent response diffusible signal duration morphogen signalling can also affect cellular responses one example morphogen sonic hedgehog shh vertebrate central nervous system limbs pattern cellular differentiation controlled amount time shh exposure- two parameters interpreted cellular level unclear provide evidence changing concentration duration shh equivalent effect intracellular signalling chick neural cells convert different concentrations shh time-limited periods signal transduction signal duration proportional shh concentration depends gradual desensitization cells ongoing shh exposure mediated shh-dependent upregulation patched ptc1 ligand-binding inhibitor shh signalling thus addition role shaping shh gradient- ptc1 participates cell autonomously gradient sensing together data reveal novel strategy morphogen interpretation temporal adaptation cells morphogen integrates concentration duration signal control differential gene expression
