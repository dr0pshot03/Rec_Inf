ceria maintains smaller metal catalyst particles strong metal-support bonding
energies silver ag atoms ag nanoparticles supported different cerium magnesium oxide surfaces determined previous calorimetric measurements metal adsorption energies analyzed respect particle size stability found increase particle size atoms per particle silver nanoparticles given size atoms much higher stability kilojoules per mole silver atoms reduced ceo mgo effect result large adhesion energy similar joules per square meter ag nanoparticles reduced ceo found result strong bonding defects ceo terraces apparently localized lattice strain results explain unusual sinter resistance late transition metal catalysts supported ceria
