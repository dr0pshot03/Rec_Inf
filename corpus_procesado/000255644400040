reconstitution contractile ftsz rings liposomes
ftsz tubulin homolog major cytoskeletal protein bacterial cell division assembles z ring contains ftsz dozen division proteins constricts divide cell constructed membrane targeted ftsz ftsz mts splicing amphipathic helix c terminus mixed lipid vesicles ftsz mts incorporated interior tubular vesicles formed multiple z rings move laterally directions along length liposome coalesce brighter z rings brighter z rings produced visible constrictions liposome suggesting ftsz can assemble z ring generate force proteins needed assembly force generation
