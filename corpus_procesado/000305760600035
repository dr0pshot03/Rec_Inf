map nucleosome positions yeast base-pair resolution 
exact positions nucleosomes along genomic dna can influence many aspects chromosome function however existing methods mapping nucleosomes provide necessary single-base-pair accuracy determine positions develop apply new approach direct mapping nucleosome centres basis chemical modification engineered histones resulting map locates nucleosome positions genome-wide unprecedented detail accuracy shows new aspects vivo nucleosome organization linked transcription factor binding rna polymerase pausing higher-order structure chromatin fibre
