marine radiocarbon evidence mechanism deglacial atmospheric co rise 
reconstructed radiocarbon activity intermediate waters eastern north pacific past years radiocarbon activity paralleled atmosphere except deglaciation intermediate-water values fell per mil large decrease requires deglacial injection old waters deep-ocean carbon reservoir previously well isolated atmosphere timing intermediate-water radiocarbon depletion closely matches atmospheric carbon dioxide rise effectively traces redistribution carbon deep ocean atmosphere deglaciation
