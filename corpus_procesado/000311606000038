over-massive black hole compact lenticular galaxy ngc 
massive galaxies supermassive black holes centres masses black holes believed correlate properties host-galaxy bulge component several explanations proposed existence locally established empirical relationships including non-causal statistical process galaxy-galaxy merging direct feedback black hole host galaxy galaxy-galaxy merging subsequent violent relaxation dissipation empirical scaling relations therefore important distinguishing various theoretical models galaxy evolution furthermore form basis black-hole mass measurements large distances observations shown mass black hole typically per cent mass stellar bulge galaxy now galaxy largest known fraction mass central black hole per cent small galaxy ngc 4486b report observations stellar kinematics ngc compact lenticular galaxy mass x solar masses data determine mass central black hole x solar masses per cent bulge mass also show observations five compact galaxies properties similar ngc therefore may also contain over-massive black holes yet known galaxies represent tail distribution disk-dominated galaxies fail follow usual black-hole mass scaling relations
