latitudinal gradient recent speciation extinction rates birds mammals
although tropics harbor greater numbers species temperate zones known whether rates speciation extinction also follow latitudinal gradient sampling birds mammals found distribution evolutionary ages sister species-pairs species others closest relative-adheres latitudinal gradient time divergence sister species shorter high latitudes longer tropics birth-death models fitting data estimate highest recent speciation extinction rates occur high latitudes decline toward tropics results conflict prevailing view links high tropical diversity elevated tropical speciation rates instead findings suggest faster turnover high latitudes contributes latitudinal diversity gradient
