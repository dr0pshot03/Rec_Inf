argonaute hits-clip decodes microrna-mrna interaction maps 
micrornas mirnas critical roles regulation gene expression however mirna activity requires base pairing nucleotides messenger rna predicting target mrnas major challenge recently high-throughput sequencing rnas isolated crosslinking immunoprecipitation hits-clip identified functional protein-rna interaction sites use hits-clip covalently crosslink native argonaute ago also called eif2c protein-rna complexes mouse brain produced two simultaneous data sets-ago-mirna ago-mrna binding sites-that combined bioinformatic analysis identify interaction sites mirna target mrna validated genome-wide interaction maps mir- generated additional maps abundant mirnas present p13 mouse brain ago hits-clip provides general platform exploring specificity range mirna action vivo identifies precise sequences targeting clinically relevant mirna-mrna interactions
