p53 mutant mice display early ageing-associated phenotypes
p53 tumour suppressor activated numerous stressors induce apoptosis cell cycle arrest senescence study biological effects altered p53 function generated mice deletion mutation first six exons p53 gene express truncated rna capable encoding carboxy-terminal p53 fragment mutation confers phenotypes consistent activated p53 rather inactivated p53 mutant p53+/m mice exhibit enhanced resistance spontaneous tumours compared wild-type p53+/+ littermates p53+/m mice age display early onset phenotypes associated ageing include reduced longevity osteoporosis generalized organ atrophy diminished stress tolerance second line transgenic mice containing temperature-sensitive mutant allele p53 also exhibits early ageing phenotypes data suggest p53 role regulating organismal ageing
