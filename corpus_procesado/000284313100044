l1 retrotransposition neurons modulated mecp2
long interspersed nuclear elements line l1s abundant retrotransposons comprise approximately % mammalian genomes- active l1 retrotransposons can impact genome variety ways creating insertions deletions new splice sites gene expression fine-tuning- shown previously l1 retrotransposons capable mobilization neuronal progenitor cells rodents humans evidence massive l1 insertions observed adult brain tissues somatic tissues addition l1 mobility adult hippocampus can influenced environment neuronal specificity somatic l1 retrotransposition neural progenitors partially due transition sox2/hdac1 repressor complex wnt-mediated t-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor tcf/lef transcriptional activator transcriptional switch accompanies chromatin remodelling neuronal differentiation allowing transient stimulation l1 transcription activity l1 retrotransposons brain development can impact gene expression neuronal function thereby increasing brain-specific genetic mosaicism understanding molecular mechanisms regulate l1 expression provide new insights role l1 retrotransposition brain development show l1 neuronal transcription retrotransposition rodents increased absence methyl-cpg-binding protein mecp2 protein involved global dna methylation human neurodevelopmental diseases using neuronal progenitor cells derived human induced pluripotent stem cells human tissues revealed patients rett syndrome rtt carrying mecp2 mutations increased susceptibility l1 retrotransposition data demonstrate l1 retrotransposition can controlled tissue-specific manner disease-related genetic mutations can influence frequency neuronal l1 retrotransposition findings add new level complexity molecular events can lead neurological disorders
