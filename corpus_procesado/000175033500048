proteasomal atpase subunit recognizes polyubiquitin degradation signal 
26s proteasome chief site regulatory protein turnover eukaryotic cells comprises one 20s catalytic complex composed four stacked rings seven members two axially positioned 19s regulatory complexes containing subunits control substrate access catalytic chamber cases targeting 26s proteasome depends tagging substrate specific type polyubiquitin chain- recognition signal followed substrate unfolding translocation presumably catalysed one six distinct aaa atpases located base-a ring-like 19s subdomain abuts axial pore 20s complex exhibits chaperone activity vitro- despite importance polyubiquitin chain recognition proteasome function site signals interaction 19s complex identified previously use crosslinking reactive polyubiquitin chain show specific atpase subunit s6 also known rpt5 contacts bound chain interaction signal 26s proteasomes modulated atp hydrolysis results suggest productive recognition proteolytic signal well proteasome assembly substrate unfolding atp-dependent events
