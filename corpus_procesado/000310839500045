bateman nature: predation offspring reduces potential sexual selection 
sexual selection driven competition mates advantage competitor determined number offspring produces early experiments angus bateman characterized interaction quantitative relationship males number mates number offspring known bateman slope sexual dimorphism one obvious results sexual selection largely requires positive bateman relationship slope provides estimate potential sexual selection however natural selection environment can also influence male success can random effects argued inclusion latter calculations mate success data pronghorn antilocapra americana reveal presence positive bateman slope year year study found evidence random effects skewed male mating success however substantial yearly variation bateman slope due predation fawns evident results support validity bateman relationship yet also demonstrate environmental extrinsic influences can limit potential sexual selection
