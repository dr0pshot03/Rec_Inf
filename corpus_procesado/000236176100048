human chromosome dna sequence analysis including novel gene identification 
chromosome although average size one gene disease-rich chromosomes human genome initial gene annotation indicates average gene density genes per megabase including protein-coding genes identified using novel methods pseudogenes one-quarter protein-coding genes shows overlap genes olfactory receptor genes human genome % located single multi-gene clusters along chromosome disorders currently attributed chromosome remain underlying molecular basis yet known including several mendelian traits cancer susceptibility loci high-quality data presented here-nearly million base pairs representing % coverage euchromatic sequence-provide scientists solid foundation understanding genetic basis disorders biological phenomena
