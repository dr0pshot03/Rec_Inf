experimental realization quantum universal gate 
classical computation bit information can flipped changed value zero one vice versa using logical gate; quantum analogue process much complicated quantum bit qubit can exist simultaneously superposition two logical states complex amplitudes impossible1- find universal transformation flip original superposed state perpendicular state values amplitudes although perfect flipping qubit prepared arbitrary state universal operation prohibited rules quantum mechanics exists optimal approximation2 procedure report experimental realization universal quantum machine4 performs best possible approximation universal transformation system adopted optical parametric amplifier entangled photon states also enabled us investigate universal quantum cloning
