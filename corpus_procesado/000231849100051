river plumes source large-amplitude internal waves coastal ocean
satellite images long revealed surface expression large amplitude internal waves propagate along density interfaces beneath sea surface- internal waves typically energetic high-frequency events coastal ocean- displacing water parcels m generating strong currents turbulence mix nutrients near-surface waters biological utilization internal waves known generated tidal currents ocean-bottom topography- also observed frequently absence apparent tide topography interactions present repeated measurements velocity density acoustic backscatter across columbia river plume front show internal waves can generated river plume flows gravity current coastal ocean find convergence horizontal velocities plume front causes frontal growth subsequent displacement downward near-surface waters individual freely propagating waves released river plume front fronts propagation speed decreases wave speed water ahead mechanism generates internal waves similar amplitude steepness internal waves tide topography interactions observed elsewhere therefore important understanding coastal ocean mixing
