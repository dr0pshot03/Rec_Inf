ataxia telangiectasia mutated atm protein kinase critical component dna-damage response network configured maintain genomic integrity abundance essential downstream effecter pathway tumor suppressor protein p53 tightly regulated controlled degradation cop1 e3 ubiquitin ligases mdm2 pirh2 however signal transduction pathway regulates cop1-p53 axis following dna damage remains enigmatic observed response dna damage atm phosphorylated cop1 ser stimulated rapid autodegradation mechanism ionizing radiation triggered atm-dependent movement cop1 nucleus cytoplasm atm-dependent phosphorylation cop1 ser necessary sufficient disrupt cop1-p53 complex subsequently abrogate ubiquitination degradation p53 furthermore phosphorylation cop1 ser required permit p53 become stabilized exert tumor suppressor properties response dna damage
