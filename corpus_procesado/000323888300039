video game training enhances cognitive control older adults
cognitive control defined set neural processes allow us interact complex environment goal-directed manner humans regularly challenge control processes attempting simultaneously accomplish multiple goals multitasking generating interference result fundamental information processing limitations clear multitasking behaviour become ubiquitous todays technologically dense world substantial evidence accrued regarding multitasking difficulties cognitive control deficits ageing population show multitasking performance assessed custom-designed three-dimensional video game neuroracer exhibits linear age-related decline years age playing adaptive version neuroracer multitasking training mode older adults years old reduced multitasking costs compared active control group no-contact control group attaining levels beyond achieved untrained year-old participants gains persisting months furthermore age-related deficits neural signatures cognitive control measured electroencephalography remediated multitasking training enhanced midline frontal theta power frontal-posterior theta coherence critically training resulted performance benefits extended untrained cognitive control abilities enhanced sustained attention working memory increase midline frontal theta power predicting training-induced boost sustained attention preservation multitasking improvement months later findings highlight robust plasticity prefrontal cognitive control system ageing brain provide first evidence knowledge custom-designed video game can used assess cognitive abilities across lifespan evaluate underlying neural mechanisms serve powerful tool cognitive enhancement
