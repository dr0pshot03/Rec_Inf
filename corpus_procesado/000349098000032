transport domain unlocking sets uptake rate aspartate transporter 
glutamate transporters terminate neurotransmission clearing synaptically released glutamate extracellular space allowing repeated rounds signalling preventing glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity crystallographic studies glutamate transporter homologue archaeon pyrococcus horikoshii gltph showed distinct transport domains translocate substrates cytoplasm moving across membrane within central trimerization scaffold report direct observations elevator-like transport domain motions context reconstituted proteoliposomes physiological ion gradients using single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer smfret imaging show gltph bearing two mutations introduced impart characteristics human transporter exhibits markedly increased transport domain dynamics parallels increased rate substrate transport thereby establishing direct temporal relationship transport domain motion substrate uptake crystallographic computational investigations corroborated findings revealing humanizing mutations favour structurally unlocked intermediate states transport cycle exhibiting increased solvent occupancy interface transport domain trimeric scaffold
