d-amino acids govern stationary phase cell wall remodeling bacteria
known organisms amino acids predominantly thought synthesized used l-enantiomers found bacteria produce diverse d-amino acids well accumulate millimolar concentrations supernatants stationary phase cultures vibrio cholerae dedicated racemase produced d-met d-leu whereas bacillus subtilis generated d-tyr d-phe unusual d-amino acids appear modulate synthesis peptidoglycan strong elastic polymer serves stress-bearing component bacterial cell wall d-amino acids influenced peptidoglycan composition amount strength means incorporation polymer regulating enzymes synthesize modify thus synthesis d-amino acids may common strategy bacteria adapt changing environmental conditions
