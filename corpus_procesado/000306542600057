high-resolution protein structure determination serial femtosecond crystallography
structure determination proteins macromolecules historically required growth high-quality crystals sufficiently large diffract x-rays efficiently withstanding radiation damage applied serial femtosecond crystallography sfx using x-ray free-electron laser xfel obtain high-resolution structural information microcrystals less micrometer micrometer micrometers well-characterized model protein lysozyme agreement synchrotron data demonstrates immediate relevance sfx analyzing structure large group difficult-to-crystallize molecules
