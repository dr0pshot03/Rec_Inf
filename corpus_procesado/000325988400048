galaxy rapidly forming stars million years big bang redshift
several dozen galaxies observed spectroscopically candidates redshift z excess seven five redshifts confirmed via lyman alpha emission z refs small fraction confirmed galaxies may indicate neutral fraction intergalactic medium rises quickly z > given lyman alpha resonantly scattered neutral gas- small samples limited depth previous observations however makes conclusions tentative report deep near-infrared spectroscopic survey photometrically-selected galaxies z > detect near-infrared emission line single galaxy confirming process making lyman alpha difficult detect detected emission line wavelength micrometres likely lyman alpha emission placing galaxy redshift z epoch million years big bang galaxys colours consistent significant metal content implying galaxies become enriched rapidly calculate surprisingly high star-formation rate solar masses per year factor greater seen milky way galaxy unexpected survey size suggesting early universe may harbour larger number intense sites star formation expected
