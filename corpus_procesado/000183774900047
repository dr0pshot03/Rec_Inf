facilitation spinal nmda receptor currents spillover synaptically released glycine 
mammalian cns n-methyl-d-aspartate nmda receptors serve prominent roles many physiological pathophysiological processes including pain transmission full activation nmda receptors require binding glycine known whether brain uses changes extracellular glycine modulate synaptic nmda responses show synaptically released glycine facilitates nmda receptor currents superficial dorsal horn area critically involved pain processing high presynaptic activity glycine released inhibitory interneurons escapes synaptic cleft reaches nearby nmda receptors so-called spillover vivo process may contribute development inflammatory hyperalgesia
