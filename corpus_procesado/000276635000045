long non-coding rna hotair reprograms chromatin state promote cancer metastasis
large intervening non-coding rnas lincrnas pervasively transcribed genome- yet potential involvement human disease well understood recent studies dosage compensation imprinting homeotic gene expression suggest individual lincrnas can function interface dna specific chromatin remodelling activities- show lincrnas hox loci become systematically dys-regulated breast cancer progression lincrna termed hotair increased expression primary breast tumours metastases hotair expression level primary tumours powerful predictor eventual metastasis death enforced expression hotair epithelial cancer cells induced genome-wide re-targeting polycomb repressive complex prc2 occupancy pattern resembling embryonic fibroblasts leading altered histone h3 lysine methylation gene expression increased cancer invasiveness metastasis manner dependent prc2 conversely loss hotair can inhibit cancer invasiveness particularly cells possess excessive prc2 activity findings indicate lincrnas active roles modulating cancer epigenome may important targets cancer diagnosis therapy
