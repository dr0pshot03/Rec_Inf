efficient mixing low reynolds numbers using polymer additives 
mixing fluids rapidly developing area fluid mechanics1- important industrial environmental problem mixing liquids low reynolds numbers usually quite weak simple flows requires special devices efficient recently problem mixing solved analytically simple case random flow known batchelor regime4- demonstrate experimentally viscous liquids containing small amount high-molecular-weight polymers can mixed quite efficiently low reynolds numbers simple flow curved channel polymer concentration % suffices presence polymers leads elastic instability9 irregular flow10 velocity spectra corresponding batchelor regime4- detailed observations mixing regime enable us confirm several important theoretical predictions: probability distributions concentration exhibit exponential tails68 moments distribution decay exponentially along flow spatial correlation function concentration decays logarithmically
