efficient mixing low reynolds numbers using polymer additives
mixing fluids rapidly developing area fluid mechanics- important industrial environmental problem mixing liquids low reynolds numbers usually quite weak simple flows requires special devices efficient recently problem mixing solved analytically simple case random flow known batchelor regime- demonstrate experimentally viscous liquids containing small amount high-molecular-weight polymers can mixed quite efficiently low reynolds numbers simple flow curved channel polymer concentration % suffices presence polymers leads elastic instability irregular flow velocity spectra corresponding batchelor regime- detailed observations mixing regime enable us confirm several important theoretical predictions: probability distributions concentration exhibit exponential tails moments distribution decay exponentially along flow spatial correlation function concentration decays logarithmically
