marine tubeworm metamorphosis induced arrays bacterial phage tail-like structures 
many benthic marine animal populations established maintained free-swimming larvae recognize cues surface-bound bacteria settle metamorphose larvae tubeworm hydroides elegans important biofouling agent require contact surface-bound bacteria undergo metamorphosis; however mechanisms underpin microbially mediated developmental transition enigmatic show marine bacterium pseudoalteromonas luteoviolacea produces arrays phage tail-like structures trigger metamorphosis h elegans arrays comprise contractile structures outward-facing baseplates linked tail fibers dynamic hexagonal net arrays suggest novel form bacterium-animal interaction provide entry point understanding marine biofilms can trigger animal development
