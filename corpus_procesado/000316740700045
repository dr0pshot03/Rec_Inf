phosphorylation dishevelled protein kinase ripk4 regulates wnt signaling
receptor-interacting protein kinase ripk4 required epidermal differentiation mutated bartsocas-papas syndrome ripk4 binds protein kinase c signaling mechanisms largely unknown ectopic ripk4 catalytically inactive bartsocas-papas ripk4 mutants induced accumulation cytosolic beta-catenin transcriptional program similar caused wnt3a xenopus embryos ripk4 synergized coexpressed xwnt8 whereas ripk4 morpholinos catalytic inactive ripk4 antagonized wnt signaling ripk4 interacted constitutively adaptor protein dvl2 wnt3a stimulation co-receptor lrp6 phosphorylation dvl2 ripk4 favored canonical wnt signaling wnt-dependent growth xenografted human tumor cells suppressed ripk4 knockdown suggesting ripk4 overexpression may contribute growth certain tumor types
