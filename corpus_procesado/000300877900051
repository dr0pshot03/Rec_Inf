repetitive motor learning induces coordinated formation clustered dendritic spines vivo
many lines evidence suggest memory mammalian brain stored distinct spatiotemporal patterns despite recent progresses identifying neuronal populations involved memory coding- synapse-level mechanism still poorly understood computational models electrophysiological data shown functional clustering synapses along dendritic branches leads nonlinear summation synaptic inputs greatly expands computing power neural network- however whether neighbouring synapses involved encoding similar memory task-specific cortical networks develop learning remain elusive using transcranial two-photon microscopy followed apical dendrites layer pyramidal neurons motor cortex mice practised novel forelimb skills show third new dendritic spines postsynaptic structures excitatory synapses formed acquisition phase learning emerge clusters clusters neighbouring spine pairs clustered new spines likely persist throughout prolonged learning sessions even long training stops non-clustered counterparts moreover formation new spine clusters requires repetition motor task emergence succedent new spines accompanies strengthening first new spine cluster also show control conditions new spines appear avoid existing stable spines rather uniformly added along dendrites however succedent new spines clusters overcome spatial constraint form close vicinity neighbouring stable spines findings suggest clustering new synapses along dendrites induced repetitive activation cortical circuitry learning providing structural basis spatial coding motor memory mammalian brain
