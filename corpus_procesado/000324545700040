efficient planar heterojunction perovskite solar cells vapour deposition
many different photovoltaic technologies developed large-scale solar energy conversion- wafer-based first-generation photovoltaic devices followed thin-film solid semiconductor absorber layers sandwiched two charge-selective contacts nanostructured mesostructured solar cells rely distributed heterojunction generate charge transport positive negative charges spatially separated phases- although many materials used nanostructured devices goal attaining high-efficiency thin-film solar cells way yet achieved organometal halide perovskites recently emerged promising material high-efficiency nanostructured devices- show nanostructuring necessary achieve high efficiencies material: simple planar heterojunction solar cell incorporating vapour-deposited perovskite absorbing layer can solar-to-electrical power conversion efficiencies per cent measured simulated full sunlight demonstrates perovskite absorbers can function highest efficiencies simplified device architectures without need complex nanostructures
