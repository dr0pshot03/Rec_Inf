neural correlates perception 3d surface orientation texture gradient
goal visual neuroscience reveal visual system reconstructs three-dimensional 3d representation world two-dimensional retinal images although importance texture gradient cues process 3d vision pointed studies concentrate neural process based binocular disparity report neural correlates depth perception texture gradient cortex caudal part lateral bank intraparietal sulcus many neurons selective 3d surface orientation defined texture gradient response invariant different types texture pattern neurons also sensitive disparity gradient suggesting integrate texture disparity gradient signals construct generalized representation 3d surface orientation
