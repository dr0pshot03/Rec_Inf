solvent-free electrolytes aqueous solution like conductivities 
aqueous solutions generally assumed superior electrolytic conductors unique dielectric fluid properties water show conductivities can matched liquid electrolytes contain solvent proton transfer salts liquid ambient temperature high conductivities due high fluidity ionicity rather sort grotthus mechanism although certain cases mobile proton population may make non-negligible contribution highest conductivities obtained cations anions contain protons 25degreesc values > millisiemens per centimeter ms cm- appear possible 100degreesc ms cm- measured combination high ionicity proton exchange kinetics low vapor pressure systems describe also make excellent fuel cell electrolytes
