small interfering rna-induced transcriptional gene silencing human cells
small interfering rna sirna rnicrorna silence genes transcriptional posttranscriptional and/or translational level using human tissue culture cells show promoter-directed sirna inhibits transcription integrated proviral elongation factor alpha ef1a promoter-green fluorescent protein reporter gene endogenous ef1a silencing associated dna methylation targeted sequence required either active transport sirna nucleus permeabilization nuclear envelope lentiviral transduction results demonstrate sirna-directed transcriptional silencing conserved mammals providing means inhibit mammalian gene function
