solvent-free oxidation primary alcohols aldehydes using au-pd/tio2 catalysts 
oxidation alcohols aldehydes o- place stoichiometric oxygen donors crucial process synthesis fine chemicals however catalysts identified far relatively inactive primary alkyl alcohols showed au/pd-tio2 catalysts give high turnover frequencies turnovers per hour oxidation alcohols including primary alkyl alcohols addition au pd nanocrystals improved overall selectivity using scanning transmission electron microscopy combined x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy showed au-pd nanocrystals made au-rich core pd-rich shell indicating au electronically influences catalytic properties pd
