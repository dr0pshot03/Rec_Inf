myosin motor muscle generates smaller slower working stroke higher load
muscle contraction driven motor protein myosin ii binds transiently actin filament generates unitary filament displacement working stroke detaches repeats cycle stroke size measured previously using isolated myosin ii molecules low load rather variable results- higher loads motor works muscle contraction used novel x-ray-interference technique measure working stroke myosin ii constant load intact muscle cell preserving native structure function motor show stroke smaller slower higher load stroke size low load likely set structural limit higher loads motor detaches actin reaching limit load dependence myosin ii stroke primary molecular determinant mechanical performance efficiency skeletal muscle
