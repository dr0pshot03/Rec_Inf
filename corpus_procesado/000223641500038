negative intrinsic resistivity individual domain wall epitaxial gamnas microdevices
magnetic domains boundaries separate domain walls dws play central role science magnetism understanding controlling domains important many technological applications spintronics may lead new devices although theoretical efforts elucidated several mechanisms underlying resistance single dw3- various experiments- report conflicting results even overall sign dw resistance question whether individual dw gives rise increase decrease resistance therefore remains open report approach dw studies class ferromagnetic semiconductors opposed metals offer promise spintronics experiments involve microdevices patterned monocrystalline ga mn epitaxial layers giant planar hall effect previously observed material enables direct real-time observation propagation individual magnetic dw along multiprobe devices apply steady pulsed magnetic fields trap carefully position individual dw within separate device studied protocol reproducibly enables high-resolution magnetoresistance measurements across individual wall consistently observe negative intrinsic dw resistance scales channel width appears originate sizeable quantum corrections magnetoresistance
