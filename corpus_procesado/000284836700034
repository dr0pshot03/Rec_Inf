u1 snrnp protects pre-mrnas premature cleavage polyadenylation 
eukaryotes u1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein snrnp forms spliceosomes equal stoichiometry u2 u4 u5 u6 snrnps; however abundance human far exceeds snrnps used antisense morpholino oligonucleotide u1 snrna achieve functional u1 snrnp knockdown hela cells identified accumulated unspliced pre-mrnas genomic tiling microarrays addition inhibiting splicing u1 snrnp knockdown caused premature cleavage polyadenylation numerous pre-mrnas cryptic polyadenylation signals frequently introns near < kilobases start transcript occur splicing inhibited u2 snrna antisense morpholino oligonucleotide u2-snrnp-inactivating drug spliceostatin unless u1 antisense morpholino oligonucleotide also included show u1 snrna-pre-mrna base pairing required suppress premature cleavage polyadenylation nearby cryptic polyadenylation signals located introns findings reveal critical splicing-independent function u1 snrnp protecting transcriptome propose explains overabundance
