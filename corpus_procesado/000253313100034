stem-cell therapy cardiac disease 
heart failure leading cause death worldwide current therapies delay progression disease laboratory experiments recent clinical trials suggest cell-based therapies can improve cardiac function implications cardiac regeneration causing great excitement bone-marrow-derived progenitor cells progenitor cells can differentiate vascular cell types restoring blood flow recently resident cardiac stem cells shown differentiate multiple cell types present heart including cardiac muscle cells indicating heart terminally differentiated new findings stimulated optimism progression heart failure can prevented even reversed cell-based therapy
