hyperelasticity governs dynamic fracture critical length scale 
elasticity solid can vary depending state deformation example metals will soften polymers may stiffen deformed levels approaching failure deformation infinitesimally small elastic moduli can considered constant hence elasticity linear yet many existing theories model fracture using linear elasticity despite fact materials will experience extreme deformations crack tips show large-scale atomistic simulations elastic behaviour observed large strains-hyperelasticity-can play governing role dynamics fracture linear theory incapable fully capturing fracture phenomena introduce concept characteristic length scale energy flux near crack tip demonstrate local hyperelastic wave speed governs crack speed hyperelastic zone approaches energy length scale
