origin protein interactions allostery colocalization 
two fundamental principles can account regulated networks interacting proteins originated cells law mass action holds binding one molecule another increases concentration fact colocalization molecules vastly increases local concentrations follows colocalization can amplify effect one protein random mutations another protein can therefore natural selection lead interactions proteins startling variety complex allosteric controls also follows allostery common homologous proteins can different allosteric mechanisms thus regulated protein networks organisms seem inevitable consequence natural selection operating physical laws
