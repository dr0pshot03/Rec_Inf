human dna ligase completely encircles partially unwinds nicked dna
end-joining reaction catalysed dna ligases required organisms serves ultimate step dna replication repair recombination processes one three well characterized mammalian dna ligases dna ligase joins okazaki fragments dna replication report crystal structure human dna ligase residues complex nicked adenylated dna intermediate structure shows enzyme redirects path double helix expose nick termini strand-joining reaction also reveals unique feature mammalian ligases: dna-binding domain allows ligase encircle dna substrate stabilizes dna distorted structure positions catalytic core nick similarities toroidal shape dimensions dna ligase proliferating cell nuclear antigen sliding clamp suggestive extensive protein-protein interface may coordinate joining okazaki fragments
