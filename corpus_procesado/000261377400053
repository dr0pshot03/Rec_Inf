centromere-associated female meiotic drive entails male fitness costs monkeyflowers 
female meiotic drive paired chromosomes compete access egg potentially powerful rarely documented evolutionary force interspecific monkeyflower mimulus hybrids driving m guttatus allele d exhibits : transmission advantage via female meiosis show extreme interspecific drive likely caused divergence centromere associated repeat domains document cytogenetic functional polymorphism drive within population m guttatus conspecific crosses d : transmission advantage nondriving alternative alleles however individuals homozygous driving allele suffered reduced pollen viability fitness effects molecular population genetic data suggest balancing selection prevents fixation loss d selfish chromosomal transmission may affect individual fitness population genetic load
