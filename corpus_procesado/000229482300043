simultaneous inhibition redistribution spontaneous light emission photonic crystals 
inhibiting spontaneous light emission redistributing energy useful forms desirable objectives advances various fields including photonics illuminations displays solar cells even quantum-information systems demonstrate inhibition redistribution spontaneous light emission using two-dimensional 2d photonic crystals refractive index changed two-dimensionally overall spontaneous emission rate found reduced factor result 2d photonic bandgap effect simultaneously light energy redistributed 2d plane direction normal photonic crystal
