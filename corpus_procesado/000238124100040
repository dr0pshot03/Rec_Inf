coherent state evolution superconducting qubit partial-collapse measurement 
measurement one fundamental building blocks quantum-information processing systems partial measurement full wavefunction collapse outcome provides detailed test measurement process introduce quantum-state tomography superconducting qubit exhibits high-fidelity single-shot measurement two probabilistic outcomes partial measurement find either full collapse coherent yet nonunitary evolution state latter behavior explicitly confirms modern quantum-measurement theory may prove important error-correction algorithms quantum computation
