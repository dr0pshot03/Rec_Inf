beating crystallization glass-forming metals millisecond heating processing 
development metal alloys form glasses modest cooling rates stimulated broad scientific technological interest however intervening crystallization liquid even robust bulk metallic glass-formers orders magnitude faster many common polymers silicate glass-forming liquids crystallization limits experimental studies undercooled liquid hampers efforts plastically process metallic glasses developed method rapidly uniformly heat metallic glass rates kelvin per second temperatures spanning undercooled liquid region liquid properties subsequently measured millisecond time scales previously inaccessible temperatures near-adiabatic conditions rapid thermoplastic forming undercooled liquid complex net shapes implemented rheological conditions typically used molding plastics operating millisecond regime able "beat" intervening crystallization successfully process even marginal glass-forming alloys limited stability crystallization processable conventional heating
