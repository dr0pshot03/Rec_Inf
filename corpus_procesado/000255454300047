phosphorylation p38 mapk alternative pathway gsk3 beta inactivation
glycogen synthase kinase beta gsk3 beta involved metabolism neurodegeneration cancer inhibition gsk3 beta activity primary mechanism regulates widely expressed active kinase although protein kinase akt inhibits gsk3 beta phosphorylation n terminus preventing akt mediated phosphorylation affect cell survival pathway activated gsk3 beta substrate beta catenin show p38 mitogen activated protein kinase mapk also inactivates gsk3 beta direct phosphorylation c terminus inactivation can lead accumulation beta catenin p38 mapk mediated phosphorylation gsk3 beta occurs primarily brain thymocytes activation beta catenin mediated signaling gsk3 beta inhibition provides potential mechanism p38 mapk mediated survival specific tissues
