coherence-incoherence dimensional crossover layered strongly correlated metals 
properties interacting electron system depend electron correlations effective dimensionality example coulomb repulsion electrons may inhibit completely block conduction intersite electron hopping thereby determining whether material metal insulator furthermore correlation effects increase number effective dimensions decreases three-dimensional systems low-energy electronic states behave quasiparticles whereas one-dimensional systems even weak interactions break quasiparticles collective excitations dimensionality particularly important exotic low-dimensional materials one two-dimensional building blocks loosely connected three-dimensional whole examine two layered metallic systems angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy electronic transport measurements find crossover number effective dimensions-from two three-with decreasing temperature apparent observation direction perpendicular layers materials insulating character high temperatures become metal-like low temperatures whereas transport within layers remains metallic whole temperature range propose change effective dimensionality correlates presence coherent quasiparticles within layers
