absence junctional glutamate receptor clusters drosophila mutants lacking spontaneous transmitter release
little known functional significance spontaneous miniature synaptic potentials result vesicular exocytosis nerve terminals using drosophila mutants specific defects presynaptic function found glutamate receptors clustered normally neuromuscular junctions mutants retained spontaneous transmitter secretion lost ability release transmitter response action potential contrast receptor clustering defective mutants spontaneous evoked vesicle exocytosis absent thus spontaneous vesicle exocytosis appears tightly linked clustering glutamate receptors development
