animal versus wind dispersal robustness tree species deforestation
studies suggest populations different species decline equally habitat loss however empirical tests confined fine spatiotemporal scales rarely included plants using data forest survey plots covering peninsular spain explored common tree species relationship probability occurrence local cover remaining forest twenty-four species showed significant negative response forest loss decreased forest cover negative effect tree diversity responses individual species highly variable animal-dispersed species less vulnerable forest loss six showing positive responses decreased forest cover results imply plant-animal interactions help prevent collapse forest communities suffer habitat destruction
