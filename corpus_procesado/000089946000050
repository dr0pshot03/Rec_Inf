acute sensitivity landslide rates initial soil porosity
landslides move imperceptibly downslope whereas others accelerate catastrophically experimental landslides triggered rising pore water pressure moved sharply contrasting rates due small differences initial porosity wet sandy soil porosity contracted slope failure partially liquefied accelerated within second speeds meter per second soil porosity dilated failure slipped episodically rates averaging meter per second repeated slip episodes induced gradually rising pore water pressure arrested pore dilation attendant pore pressure decline
