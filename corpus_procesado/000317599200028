gating trkh ion channel associated rck protein trka 
trkh belongs superfamily k+ transport proteins required growth bacteria low external k+ concentrations crystal structure trkh vibrio parahaemolyticus showed trkh resembles k+ channel may gating mechanism substantially different k+ channels trkh assembles trka cytosolic protein comprising two rck regulate conductance k+ domains found certain k+ channels control gating however fundamental questions whether trkh ion channel regulated trka remain unresolved show single-channel activity trkh upregulated atp via trka report two structures tetrameric trka ring one complex trkh one isolation ring assumes two markedly different conformations results suggest mechanism atp increases trkh activity inducing conformational changes trka
