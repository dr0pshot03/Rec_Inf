homologue engagement controls meiotic dna break number distribution 
meiotic recombination promotes genetic diversification well pairing segregation homologous chromosomes double-strand breaks dsbs initiate recombination dangerous lesions can cause mutation meiotic failure cells control dsbs balance beneficial deleterious outcomes well understood test hypothesis dsb control involves network intersecting negative regulatory circuits using multiple complementary methods show dsbs form greater numbers saccharomyces cerevisiae cells lacking zmm proteins suite recombination-promoting factors traditionally regarded acting strictly downstream dsb formation zmm-dependent dsb control genetically distinct pathway tying break formation meiotic progression ndt80 transcription factor counterintuitive findings suggest homologous chromosomes successfully engaged one another stop making breaks genome-wide dsb maps uncover distinct responses different subchromosomal domains zmm mutation zip3 also known cst9 show zip3 required previously unexplained tendency dsb density vary chromosome size thus feedback tied zmm function contributes unexpected ways spatial patterning recombination
