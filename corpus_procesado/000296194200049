saccharomyces cerevisiae thi4p suicide thiamine thiazole synthase 
thiamine pyrophosphate essential cofactor living systems biosynthesis involves separate syntheses pyrimidine thiazole precursors coupled two biosynthetic routes thiamine thiazole identified prokaryotes five enzymes act three substrates produce thiazole via complex oxidative condensation reaction mechanistic details now well established- contrast one gene product involved thiazole biosynthesis eukaryotes thi4p saccharomyces cerevisiae report preparation fully active recombinant wild-type thi4p identification iron-dependent sulphide transfer reaction conserved cysteine residue protein reaction intermediate demonstration thi4p suicide enzyme undergoing single turnover
