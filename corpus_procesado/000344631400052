three-dimensional human neural cell culture model alzheimers disease 
alzheimers disease common form dementia characterized two pathological hallmarks: amyloid-beta plaques neurofibrillary tangles1 amyloid hypothesis alzheimers disease posits excessive accumulation amyloid-beta peptide leads neurofibrillary tangles composed aggregated hyperphosphorylated tau23 however date single disease model serially linked two pathological events using human neuronal cells mouse models familial alzheimers disease fad mutations exhibit amyloid-beta-induced synaptic memory deficits fully recapitulate key pathological events alzheimers disease including distinct neurofibrillary tangle pathology45 human neurons derived alzheimers disease patients shown elevated levels toxic amyloid-beta species phosphorylated tau demonstrate amyloid-beta plaquesor neurofibrillary tangles6- report fad mutations beta-amyloid precursor protein presenilin able induce robust extracellular deposition amyloid-beta including amyloid-beta plaques human neural stem-cell-derived three-dimensional 3d culture system importantly 3d-differentiated neuronal cells expressing fad mutations exhibited high levels detergent-resistant silver-positive aggregates phosphorylated tau soma neurites well filamentous tau detected immunoelectron microscopy inhibition amyloidb beta generation beta gamma-secretase inhibitors decreased amyloid-beta pathology also attenuated tauopathy also found glycogen synthase kinase gsk3 regulated amyloid-beta-mediated tau phosphorylation successfully recapitulated amyloid-beta tau pathology single 3d human neural cell culture system unique strategy recapitulating alzheimers disease pathology 3d neural cell culture model also serve facilitate development precise human neural cell models neurodegenerative disorders
