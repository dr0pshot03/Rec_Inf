multiple roles arabidopsis vrn1 vernalization flowering time control
arabidopsis vrn genes mediate vernalization process long period cold induces mitotically stable state leads accelerated flowering later development vrn1 encodes protein binds dna vitro non sequence-specific manner functions stable repression major target vernalization pathway oral repressor flc overexpression vrn1 reveals vernalization-independent function vrn1 mediated predominantly oral pathway integrator ft demonstrates vrn1 requires vernalization-specific factors target flc
