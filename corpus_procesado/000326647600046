identification genetic variants affect histone modifications human cells
histone modifications important markers function chromatin state yet dna sequence elements direct specific genomic locations poorly understood identify hundreds quantitative trait loci genome-wide affect histone modification rna polymerase ii pol ii occupancy yoruba lymphoblastoid cell lines lcls many cases variant associated quantitative changes multiple histone marks pol ii well deoxyribonuclease sensitivity nucleosome positioning transcription factor binding site polymorphisms correlated overall differences local histone modification identify specific transcription factors whose binding leads histone modification lcls furthermore variants affect chromatin distal regulatory sites frequently also direct changes chromatin gene expression associated promoters
