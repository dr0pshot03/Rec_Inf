electrical anisotropy slow fast-moving plates: paleoflow upper mantle
upper mantle electrical conductivities can explained hydrogen diffusivity hydrous olivine diffusivity enhances conductivity olivine anisotropically making axis conductive three axes therefore hypothesis plate motion induces lattice-preferred orientation olivine can tested use long-period electromagnetic array measurements compared electrical anisotropies stow-moving fennoscandian fast-moving australian plates degree olivine alignment greater mantle fennoscandian plate australian plate finding may indicate convection rather plate motion dominant deformation mechanism
