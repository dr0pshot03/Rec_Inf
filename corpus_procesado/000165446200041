resistance spikes transitions quantum hall ferromagnets
report manifestation first-order magnetic transitions two-dimensional electron systems phenomenon occurs aluminum arsenide quantum wells sufficiently low carrier densities appears set hysteretic spikes resistance sample placed crossed parallel perpendicular magnetic fields spike occurring transition states different partial magnetizations experiments thus indicate presence magnetic domains transition starkly increases dissipation effect also suspected ferromagnetic materials analysis positions transition spikes allows us deduce change exchange-correlation energy across magnetic transition turn will help improve understanding metallic ferromagnetism
