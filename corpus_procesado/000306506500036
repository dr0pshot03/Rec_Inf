high velocity dispersion rare grand-design spiral galaxy redshift z 
although grand-design spiral galaxies relatively common local universe one spectroscopically confirmed lie redshift z > hdfx z may prove major merger simply resembles spiral projection rarity spirals explained result disks dynamically hot z > refs may instead favour formation commonly observed clumpy structures- alternatively current instrumentation may simply sensitive enough detect spiral structures comparable modern universe z < velocity dispersion disks decreases spiral galaxies numerous z approximate refs report observations grand-design spiral galaxy q2343-bx442 z spectroscopy ionized gas shows disk dynamically hot implying uncertain origin spiral structure kinematics galaxy consistent thick disk undergoing minor merger can drive formation short-lived spiral structure- duty cycle < myr tidally induced spiral structure hot massive disk consistent rarity
