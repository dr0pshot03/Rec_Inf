structures ccr5 n terminus tyrosine-sulfated antibody hiv gp120 cd4 
ccr5 co-receptor binds hiv gp120 envelope glycoprotein facilitates hiv entry cells n terminus tyrosine-sulfated many antibodies react co-receptor binding site gp120 applied nuclear magnetic resonance crystallographic techniques analyze structure ccr5 n terminus tyrosine-sulfated antibody 412d complex gp120 cd4 conformations tyrosine-sulfated regions ccr5 alpha-helix 412d extended-loop surprisingly different nonetheless critical sulfotyrosine ccr5 412d induces similar structural rearrangements gp120 results now provide framework understanding hiv interactions ccr5 n terminus viral entry define conserved site gp120 whose recognition sulfotyrosine engenders posttranslational mimicry immune system
