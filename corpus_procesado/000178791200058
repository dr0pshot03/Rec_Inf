network motifs: simple building blocks complex networks 
complex networks studied across many fields science uncover structural design principles defined network motifs patterns interconnections occurring complex networks numbers significantly higher randomized networks found motifs networks biochemistry neurobiology ecology engineering motifs shared ecological food webs distinct motifs shared genetic networks escherichia coli saccharomyces cerevisiae found world wide web similar motifs found networks perform information processing even though describe elements different biomolecules within cell synaptic connections neurons caenorhabditis elegans motifs may thus define universal classes networks approach may uncover basic building blocks networks
