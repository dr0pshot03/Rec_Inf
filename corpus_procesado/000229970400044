contact force measurements stress-induced anisotropy granular materials 
interparticle forces granular media form inhomogeneous distribution filamentary force chains understanding forces spatial correlations specifically response forces system boundaries represents fundamental goal granular mechanics problem relevance civil engineering geophysics physics- important understanding jamming shear-induced yielding mechanical response report measurements normal tangential grain-scale forces inside two-dimensional system photoelastic disks subject pure shear isotropic compression various statistical measures show underlying differences two stress states differences appear distributions normal forces rounded compression shear although distributions tangential forces exponential cases sheared systems show anisotropy distributions contact network contact forces anisotropy also occurs spatial correlations forces provide quantitative replacement idea force chains sheared systems long-range correlations direction force chains whereas isotropically compressed systems short-range correlations regardless direction
