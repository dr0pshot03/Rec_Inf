large neutral fraction cosmic hydrogen billion years big bang 
fraction ionized hydrogen left big bang provides evidence time formation first stars quasar black holes early universe objects provide high-energy photons necessary ionize hydrogen spectra two distant known quasars show nearly complete absorption photons wavelengths shorter lyman alpha transition neutral hydrogen indicating hydrogen intergalactic medium igm completely ionized redshift z approximate one billion years big bang show igm surrounding quasars neutral hydrogen fraction tens per cent quasar activity started much higher previous lower limits similar to0 per cent results combined recent inference large cumulative optical depth electron scattering cosmological recombination therefore suggest presence second peak mean ionization history universe
