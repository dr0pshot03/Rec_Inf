disruptive coloration background pattern matching 
effective camouflage renders target indistinguishable irrelevant background objects two interrelated logically distinct mechanisms background pattern matching crypsis disruptive coloration: former animals colours random sample background latter bold contrasting colours animals periphery break outline latter long proposed explanation apparently conspicuous coloration animals standard textbook material surprisingly one quantitative test theory exists one experimental test effectiveness non-human predators test two key predictions: patterns bodys outline particularly effective promoting concealment highly contrasting colours enhance disruptive effect artificial moth-like targets exposed bird predation field experimental colour patterns wings dead mealworm edible body survival analysis supported predictions indicating disruptive coloration effective means camouflage beyond background pattern matching
