futile protein folding cycles er terminated unfolded protein o-mannosylation pathway 
newly synthesized polypeptides fold assemble assistance protein chaperones full maturation can take multiple attempts exchanging chaperones round improperly folded molecules must exit folding cycles degraded endoplasmic reticulum er prolonged substrate cycling detrimental expends chaperone energy resources increases toxic reactive oxygen species budding yeast found unfolded protein o-mannosylation terminated failed folding attempts pmt1/pmt2 complex o-mannosylation incapacitated target molecule folding removed folding cycles reducing engagement kar2 chaperone vitro protein refolding assay modification intrinsically irreversibly disabled folding potential substrate thus protein folding termination can involve covalent glycosylation event
