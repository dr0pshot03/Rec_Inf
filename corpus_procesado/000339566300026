topoisomerase ii mediates meiotic crossover interference 
spatial patterning ubiquitous feature biological systems meiotic crossovers provide interesting example defined classic phenomenon crossover interference identify molecular pathway interference analysing crossover patterns budding yeast topoisomerase ii plays central role thus identifying new function critical molecule sumoylation topoisomerase ii axis component red1 ubiquitin-mediated removal sumoylated proteins also required findings support hypothesis crossover interference involves accumulation relief redistribution mechanical stress along protein/ dna meshwork meiotic chromosome axes topoisomerase ii required adjust spatial relationships among dna segments
