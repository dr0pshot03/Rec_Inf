efficient photoelectric x-ray polarimeter study black holes neutron stars 
study astronomical objects using electromagnetic radiation involves four basic observational approaches: imaging spectroscopy photometry accurate counting photons received polarimetry measurement polarizations observed photons contrast observations wavelengths lack sensitivity prevented x-ray astronomy making use polarimetry yet technique provide direct picture state matter extreme magnetic gravitational fields1- potential resolve internal structures compact sources otherwise remain inaccessible even x-ray interferometry7 binary pulsars example directly see rotation magnetic field determine emission form fan pencil beam18 also observation characteristic twisting polarization angle compact sources reveal presence black hole9- report development instrument makes x-ray polarimetry possible factor improvement sensitivity achieved will allow direct exploration dramatic objects x-ray sky
