tunneling electrons potential barrier fundamental chemical reactions electronic transport semiconductors superconductors magnetism devices terahertz oscillators whereas tunneling typically controlled electric fields completely different approach bind electrons bosonic quasiparticles photonic component quasiparticles made light-matter microcavity polaritons recently demonstrated bose-condense superfluids whereas spatially separated coulomb-bound electrons holes possess strong dipole interactions use tunneling polaritons connect two realms producing bosonic quasiparticles static dipole moments resulting three-state system yields dark polaritons analogous atomic systems optical waveguides thereby offering new possibilities electromagnetically induced transparency room-temperature condensation adiabatic photon-to-electron transfer
