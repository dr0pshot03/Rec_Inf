germanium nanowire growth eutectic temperature
nanowires conventionally assumed grow via vapor-liquid-solid process material vapor incorporated growing nanowire via liquid catalyst commonly low-melting point eutectic alloy however nanowires observed grow eutectic temperature state catalyst remains controversial using situ microscopy showed classic ge/au system nanowire growth can occur eutectic temperature either liquid solid catalysts temperature found unexpectedly catalyst state depends growth pressure thermal history suggest phenomena may due kinetic enrichment eutectic alloy composition expect results relevant nanowire systems
