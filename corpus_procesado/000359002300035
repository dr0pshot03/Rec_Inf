conversion amides esters nickel-catalysed activation amide c-n bonds 
amides common functional groups studied century1 key building blocks proteins present broad range natural synthetic compounds amides known poor electrophiles typically attributed resonance stability amide bond12 although amides can readily cleaved enzymes proteases3 difficult selectively break carbon-nitrogen bond amide using synthetic chemistry demonstrate amide carbon-nitrogen bonds can activated cleaved using nickel catalysts use methodology convert amides esters challenging underdeveloped transformation reaction methodology proceeds exceptionally mild reaction conditions avoids use large excess alcohol nucleophile density functional theory calculations provide insight thermodynamics catalytic cycle amide-to-ester transformation results provide way harness amide functional groups synthetic building blocks expected lead use amides construction carbon-heteroatom carbon-carbon bonds using non-precious-metal catalysis
