controlling anisotropic nanoparticle growth plasmon excitation
inorganic nanoparticles exhibit size-dependent properties interest applications ranging biosensing- catalysis optics data storage readily available wide variety discrete compositions sizes- shape-selective synthesis strategies now also yield shapes nanospheres anisotropic metal nanostructures interesting optical properties- demonstrate previously described photoinduced method converting silver nanospheres triangular silver nanocrystals-so-called nanoprisms-can extended synthesize relatively mono-disperse nanoprisms desired edge lengths nm range particle growth process controlled using dual-beam illumination nanoparticles appears driven surface plasmon excitations find depending illumination wavelengths chosen plasmon excitations lead either fusion nanoprisms edge-selective manner growth nanoprisms reach light-controlled final size
