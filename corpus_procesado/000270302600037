remote triggering fault-strength changes san andreas fault parkfield 
fault strength fundamental property seismogenic zones temporal changes can increase decrease likelihood failure ultimate triggering seismic events although changes fault strength suggested explain various phenomena remote triggering seismicity means actually monitoring important property situ argue similar years observation - parkfield area san andreas fault revealed means monitoring fault strength identified two occasions long-term changes fault strength probably induced remotely large seismic events namely magnitude m sumatra-andaman earthquake earlier m landers earthquake cases change possessed two manifestations: temporal variations properties seismic scatterers-probably reflecting stress-induced migration fluids-and systematic temporal variations characteristics repeating-earthquake sequences consistent changes fault strength case landers earthquake period reduced strength probably triggered parkfield aseismic transient- well accompanying cluster four m> earthquakes parkfield fault-strength changes produced distant sumatra-andaman earthquake especially important suggest largest earthquakes may global influence strength earths fault systems perturbation bring many fault zones closer failure lead temporal clustering global seismicity hypothesis seems supported unusually high number m > earthquakes occurring years following sumatra-andaman earthquake
