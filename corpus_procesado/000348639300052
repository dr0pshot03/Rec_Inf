expansion microscopy
optical microscopy fine structural details resolved using refraction magnify images specimen discovered synthesizing swellable polymer network within specimen can physically expanded resulting physical magnification covalently anchoring specific labels located within specimen directly polymer network labels spaced closer optical diffraction limit can isotropically separated optically resolved process call expansion microscopy exm thus process can used perform scalable superresolution microscopy diffraction-limited microscopes demonstrate exm apparent similar nanometer lateral resolution cultured cells brain tissue performing three-color superresolution imaging similar cubic micrometers mouse hippocampus conventional confocal microscope
