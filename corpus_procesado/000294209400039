polar actomyosin contractility destabilizes position cytokinetic furrow 
cytokinesis physical separation daughter cells end mitosis requires precise regulation mechanical properties cell periphery although studies cytokinetic mechanics mostly focus equatorial constriction ring contractile actomyosin cortex also present poles dividing cells whether polar forces influence cytokinetic cell shape furrow positioning remains open question demonstrate polar cortex makes cytokinesis inherently unstable show limited asymmetric polar contractions occur cytokinesis perturbing polar cortex leads cell shape oscillations resulting furrow displacement aneuploidy theoretical model based competition cortex turnover contraction dynamics accurately accounts oscillations propose membrane blebs commonly form poles dividing cells whose role cytokinesis long enigmatic stabilize cell shape acting valves releasing cortical contractility findings reveal inherent instability shape dividing cell unveil novel spindle-independent mechanism ensuring stability cleavage furrow positioning
