basal transcription factor activates represses transcription 
identified activity required transcription downstream promoter element dpe-containing core promoters vitro purified factor found drosophila homolog transcriptional repressor known nc2 dr1-drap1 purified recombinant dnc2 activates dpe-driven promoters represses tata-driven promoters mutant version dnc2 can activate dpe promoters unable repress tata promoters thus activation repression functions distinct studies reveal nc2 dr1-drap1 bifunctional basal transcription factor differentially regulates gene transcription dpe tata box motifs
