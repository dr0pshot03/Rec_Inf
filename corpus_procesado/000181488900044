growth dynamics underlying petal shape asymmetry 
development commonly involves generation complex shapes simpler ones one way following process use landmarks track fate particular points developing organ- limited time can monitored use alternative method clonal analysis whereby dividing cells genetically marked descendants identified visually observe development antirrhinum snapdragon petals clonal analysis previously used estimate growth parameters leaves- drosophila wings- results integrated within dynamic growth model develop model use show key aspect shape-petal asymmetry-in petal lobe antirrhinum depends direction growth rather regional differences growth rate direction growth maintained parallel proximodistal axis flower irrespective changes shape implying long-range signals orient growth along petal whole signals may provide general mechanism orienting growth growing structures
