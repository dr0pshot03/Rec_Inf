reconstructing dna methylation maps neandertal denisovan
ancient dna sequencing recently provided high-coverage archaic human genomes however evolution epigenetic regulation along human lineage remains largely unexplored reconstructed full dna methylation maps neandertal denisovan harnessing natural degradation processes methylated unmethylated cytosines comparing ancient methylation maps present-day humans identified similar differentially methylated regions dmrs particularly found substantial methylation changes hoxd cluster may explain anatomical differences archaic present-day humans additionally found dmrs significantly likely associated diseases study provides insight epigenetic landscape closest evolutionary relatives opens window explore epigenomes extinct species
