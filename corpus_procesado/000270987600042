trench-parallel anisotropy produced serpentine deformation hydrated mantle wedge 
seismic anisotropy powerful tool detecting geometry style deformation earths interior primarily reflects deformation-induced preferred orientation anisotropic crystals12 although seismic anisotropy uppermantle generally attributed crystal-preferred orientation olivine3 strong trench-parallel anisotropy delay time one two seconds observed several subduction systems45 difficult explain terms olivine anisotropy even entire mantle wedge act anisotropic source show crystal-preferred orientation serpentine main hydrous mineral upper mantle can produce strong trench-parallel seismic anisotropy observed subduction systems high-pressure deformation experiments reveal serpentine c-axis tends rotate orientation normal shear plane deformation; consequently seismic velocity propagating normal shear plane plate interface much slower directions seismic anisotropy estimated deformed serpentine aggregates order magnitude greater olivine6 therefore alignment serpentine hydrated mantle wedge results strong trench-parallel seismic anisotropy case steeply subducting slab hypothesis also consistent presence hydrous phase mantle wedge inferred anomalously low seismic-wave velocities7
