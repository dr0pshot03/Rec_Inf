electron transport molecular wire junctions 
molecular conductance junctions structures single molecules small groups molecules conduct electrical current two electrodes junctions connection molecule electrodes greatly affects current-voltage characteristics despite several experimental theoretical advances including understanding simple systems still limited correspondence experimental theoretical studies systems
