role prolyl isomerase pin1 protecting age-dependent neurodegeneration
neuropathological hallmarks alzheimers disease tauopathies include senile plaques and/or neurofibrillary tangles- although mouse models created overexpressing specific proteins including beta-amyloid precursor protein presenilin tau- model generated gene knockout phosphorylation tau proteins serine threonine residues preceding proline seems precede tangle formation neurodegeneration alzheimers disease- notably phosphoser/thr-pro motifs exist two distinct conformations whose conversion proteins catalysed pin1 prolyl isomerase- pin1 activity can directly restore conformation function phosphorylated tau can indirectly promoting dephosphorylation suggests pin1 involved neurodegeneration however genetic evidence lacking show pin1 expression inversely correlated predicted neuronal vulnerability actual neurofibrillary degeneration alzheimers disease pin1 knockout mice causes progressive age-dependent neuropathy characterized motor behavioural deficits tau hyperphosphorylation tau filament formation neuronal degeneration thus pin1 pivotal protecting age-dependent neurodegeneration providing insight pathogenesis treatment alzheimers disease tauopathies
