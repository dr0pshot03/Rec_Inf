role prolyl isomerase pin1 protecting age-dependent neurodegeneration 
neuropathological hallmarks alzheimers disease tauopathies include senile plaques and/or neurofibrillary tangles1- although mouse models created overexpressing specific proteins including beta-amyloid precursor protein presenilin tau1- model generated gene knockout phosphorylation tau proteins serine threonine residues preceding proline seems precede tangle formation neurodegeneration alzheimers disease11- notably phosphoser/thr-pro motifs exist two distinct conformations whose conversion proteins catalysed pin1 prolyl isomerase15- pin1 activity can directly restore conformation function phosphorylated tau can indirectly promoting dephosphorylation suggests pin1 involved neurodegeneration141819; however genetic evidence lacking show pin1 expression inversely correlated predicted neuronal vulnerability actual neurofibrillary degeneration alzheimers disease pin1 knockout mice causes progressive age-dependent neuropathy characterized motor behavioural deficits tau hyperphosphorylation tau filament formation neuronal degeneration thus pin1 pivotal protecting age-dependent neurodegeneration providing insight pathogenesis treatment alzheimers disease tauopathies
