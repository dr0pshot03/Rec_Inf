quality control ribosome following peptide bond formation 
overall fidelity protein synthesis thought rely combined accuracy two basic processes: aminoacylation transfer rnas cognate amino acid aminoacyl trna synthetases selection cognate aminoacyl trnas ribosome cooperation gtpase elongation factor ef tu two processes together ensure specific acceptance correctly charged cognate trna aminoacyl site operate peptide bond formation report identification additional mechanism contributes high fidelity protein synthesis peptidyl transfer using well defined vitro bacterial translation system retrospective quality control step incorporation amino acid non cognate trna growing polypeptide chain leads general loss specificity site ribosome thus propagation errors results abortive termination protein synthesis
