individual cell migration serves driving force optic vesicle evagination
cellular mechanisms underlying organ formation largely unknown visualized early vertebrate eye morphogenesis single-cell resolution vivo imaging medaka oryzias latipes optic vesicle evagination retinal progenitor cells rpcs modulate convergence fate-specific manner presumptive forebrain cells converge toward midline whereas medial rpcs remain stationary predetermining site evagination subsequent optic vesicle evagination driven active migration individual rpcs analysis mutants demonstrated retina-specific transcription factor rx3 determines convergence migration behaviors rpcs hence migration individual cells mediates essential steps organ morphogenesis
