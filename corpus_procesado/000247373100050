energy-dependent regulation cell structure amp-activated protein kinase
amp-activated protein kinase ampk also known snf1a primarily studied metabolic regulator activated response energy deprivation although relatively ample information biochemical characteristics ampk enough data exist vivo function kinase using drosophila model system generated first animal model ampk activity discovered physiological functions kinase surprisingly ampk-null mutants lethal severe abnormalities cell polarity mitosis similar lkb1-null mutants constitutive activation ampk restored many phenotypes lkb1-null mutants suggesting ampk mediates polarity mitosis-controlling functions lkb1 serine/threonine kinase interestingly regulatory site non-muscle myosin regulatory light chain mrlc also known mlc2 directly phosphorylated ampk moreover phosphomimetic mutant mrlc3 rescued ampk-null defects cell polarity mitosis suggesting mrlc critical downstream target ampk furthermore activation ampk energy deprivation sufficient cause dramatic changes cell shape inducing complete polarization brush border formation human ls174t cell line phosphorylation mrlc taken together results demonstrate ampk highly conserved roles across metazoan species control metabolism also regulation cellular structures
