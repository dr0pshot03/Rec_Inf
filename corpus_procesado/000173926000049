midbrain control three-dimensional head orientation 
little known neural mechanisms controlling head posture fait clinical syndromes like torticollis well established however brain controls eye position integrating eye velocity commands electrically stimulating reversibly inactivating midbrain sites head-free nonimmobilized monkey found interstitial nucleus cajal functions neural integrator head posture suggest bilateral imbalance structure either direct damage inappropriate input one mechanisms underlying torticollis
