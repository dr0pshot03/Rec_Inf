multiple phosphorylation sites confer reproducibility rods single-photon responses 
although signals controlled single molecules expected inherently variable rod photoreceptors generate reproducible responses single absorbed photons show unexpected reproducibility consistency amplitude duration rhodopsin activity varies graded systematic manner number identity phosphorylation sites rhodopsins c terminus results indicate phosphorylation site provides independent step rhodopsin deactivation collectively steps tightly control rhodopsins active lifetime g protein cascades may exploit similar mechanism encode accurately timing number receptor activation
