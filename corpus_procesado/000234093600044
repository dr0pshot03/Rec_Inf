island biogeography populations: introduced species transforms survival patterns
population phenomena provide much underlying basis theoretical structure island biogeography received little direct study determined key population trait-survival-in bahamian lizard anolis sagrei islands experimentally introduced predatory lizard neighboring unmanipulated islands unmanipulated islands survival declined several variables notably vegetation height: island shortest vegetation nearly highest survival recorded lizard islands introduced predator forages mostly ground sagrei shifted taller vegetation unlike unmanipulated islands survival low islands shortest vegetation higher others thus species introduction radically changed resident species relation survival key island-biogeogriphical variable
