enantioselective construction remote quaternary stereocentres 
small molecules contain all-carbon quaternary stereocentres-carbon atoms bonded four distinct carbonsubstituentsare found many secondary metabolites pharmaceutical agents construction compounds enantioselective fashion remains long-standing challenge synthetic organic chemists particular methods synthesizing quaternary stereocentres remote functional groups underdeveloped report catalytic enantioselective intermolecular heck-type reaction trisubstituted-alkenyl alcohols aryl boronic acids method provides direct access quaternary all-carbon-substituted beta- gamma- delta- epsilon-or zeta-aryl carbonyl compounds unsaturation alkene relayed alcohol resulting formation carbonyl group scope process also includes incorporation pre-existing stereocentres along alkyl chain links alkene alcohol stereocentre preserved method described allows access diverse molecular building blocks containing enantiomerically enriched quaternary centre
