osteoblast: sophisticated fibroblast central surveillance 
study biology osteoblasts bone-forming cells illustrates mammalian genetics profoundly modified understanding cell differentiation physiologic processes indeed genetic-based studies past years revealed osteoblast differentiation controlled growth transcription factors likewise recent identification using mutant mouse models central component regulation bone formation expands understanding control bone remodeling regulatory loop involves hormone leptin may help explain protective effect obesity bone mass humans addition provides novel physiologic concept may shed light etiology osteoporosis help identify new therapeutic targets
