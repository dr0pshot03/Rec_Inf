salinity temperature delta o glacial deep ocean
use pore fluid measurements chloride concentration oxygen isotopic composition ocean drilling program cores reconstruct salinity temperature deep ocean last glacial maximum lgm data show temperatures deep pacific southern atlantic oceans lgm relatively homogeneous within error freezing point seawater oceans surface chloride data show glacial strati cation dominated salinity variations contrast modern ocean temperature plays primary role lgm southern ocean contained saltiest water deep ocean reversal modern salinity contrast north south atlantic implies freshwater budget poles must quite different strict conversion mean salinity lgm equivalent sea-level change yields value excess meters however storage fresh water ice shelves and/or groundwater reserves implies glacial salinity poor predictor mean sea level
