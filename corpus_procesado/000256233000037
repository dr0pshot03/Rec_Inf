massive horizontal gene transfer bdelloid rotifers 
horizontal gene transfer metazoans documented species usually associated endosymbiosis parasitism contrast bdelloid rotifers found many genes appear originated bacteria fungi plants concentrated telomeric regions along diverse mobile genetic elements bdelloid proximal gene rich regions however appeared lack foreign genes thereby resembling model metazoan organisms foreign genes defective whereas others intact transcribed latter contained functional spliceosomal introns one gene apparently bacterial origin overexpressed escherichia coli yielded active enzyme capture functional assimilation exogenous genes may represent important force bdelloid evolution
