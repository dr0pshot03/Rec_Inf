bioinspired design assembly platelet reinforced polymer films
although strong stiff human made composites long developed microstructure todays advanced composites yet achieve order sophisticated hierarchy hybrid materials built living organisms nature clay based nanocomposites layered structure can reach notable stiffness strength properties usually accompanied ductility flaw tolerance found structures generated natural hybrid materials using principles found natural composites showed layered hybrid films combining high tensile strength ductile behavior can obtained bottom colloidal assembly strong submicrometer thick ceramic platelets within ductile polymer matrix
