simultaneous state measurement coupled josephson phase qubits 
one many challenges building scalable quantum computer single-shot measurement quantum bits qubits used simultaneous single-shot measurement coupled josephson phase qubits directly probe interaction qubits time domain concept measurement crosstalk introduced show effects minimized careful adjustment timing measurements observe antiphase oscillation two-qubit states consistent quantum mechanical entanglement states thereby opening possibility full characterization multiqubit gates elementary quantum algorithms
