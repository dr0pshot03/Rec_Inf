coffee genome provides insight convergent evolution caffeine biosynthesis 
coffee valuable beverage crop due characteristic flavor aroma stimulating effects caffeine generated high-quality draft genome species coffea canephora displays conserved chromosomal gene order among asterid angiosperms although shows sign whole-genome triplication identified solanaceae species tomato genome includes several species-specific gene family expansions among n-methyltransferases nmts involved caffeine production defense-related genes alkaloid flavonoid enzymes involved secondary compound synthesis comparative analyses caffeine nmts demonstrate genes expanded sequential tandem duplications independently genes cacao tea suggesting caffeine eudicots polyphyletic origin
