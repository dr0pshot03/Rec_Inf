glycosylation restores survival chilled blood platelets
cooling blood platelets clusters von willebrand factor receptor complex macrophage alphambeta integrins bind gpibalpha subunit clustered complex resulting rapid clearance transfused cooled platelets precludes refrigeration platelets transfusion current practice room temperature storage major drawbacks document alphambeta lectin recognizes exposed beta-n-acetylglucosamine residues n-linked glycans gpibalpha enzymatic galactosylation chilled platelets blocks alphambeta recognition prolonging circulation functional cooled platelets platelet-associated galactosyltransferase produces efficient galactosylation uridine diphosphate galactose added affording potentially simple method storing platelets cold
