seismic anisotropy beneath ruapehu volcano: possible eruption forecasting tool 
orientation crustal seismic anisotropy changed least twice 80degrees volcanic eruptions ruapehu volcano new zealand changes provide basis new monitoring technique possibly future midterm eruption forecasting volcanoes fast anisotropic direction measured three seismometer deployments providing situ measurement stress crust volcano stress direction changed eruption - measurements revealed partial return pre-eruption stress state changes probably caused repeated filling depressurizing magmatic dike system
