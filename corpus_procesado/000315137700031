thin crust evidence depleted mantle supporting marion rise
global ridge system dominated oceanic rises reflecting large variations axial depth associated mantle hotspots little-studied marion rise large icelandic rise considering length depth axial rift rather high nearly entire length uniquely along southwest indian ridge systematic sampling allows direct examination crustal architecture full length show unlike icelandic rise peridotites extensively exposed high rise revealing crust generally thin often missing rifted rise therefore marion rise must largely isostatic response ancient melting events created low-density depleted mantle beneath southwest indian ridge rather thickened crust large thermal anomaly origin depleted mantle probably mantle emplaced african asthenosphere karoo madagascar flood basalt events
