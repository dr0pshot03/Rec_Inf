tumours pi3k activation resistant dietary restriction
dietary restriction delays incidence decreases growth various types tumours mechanisms underlying sensitivity tumours food restriction remain unknown show certain human cancer cell lines grown tumour xenografts mice highly sensitive anti-growth effects dietary restriction whereas others resistant cancer cells form dietary-restriction-resistant tumours carry mutations cause constitutive activation phosphatidylinositol--kinase pi3k pathway culture proliferate absence insulin insulin-like growth factor substitution activated mutant allele pi3k wild-type pi3k otherwise isogenic cancer cells restoration pten expression pten-null cancer cell line sufficient convert dietary-restriction-resistant tumour one dietary-restriction-sensitive dietary restriction affect pten-null mouse model prostate cancer significantly decreases tumour burden mouse model lung cancer lacking constitutive pi3k signalling thus pi3k pathway important determinant sensitivity tumours dietary restriction activating mutations pathway may influence response cancers dietary restriction-mimetic therapies
