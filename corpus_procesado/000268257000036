formation evenly spaced ridges valleys
one striking examples self-organization landscapes emergence evenly spaced ridges valleys- despite prevalence uniform valley spacing theory shown predict fundamental topographic wavelength models long-term landscape evolution can produce landforms look realistic- metrics exist assess similarity models natural landscapes show ridge-valley wavelength can predicted erosional mechanics equations mass conservation sediment transport derive characteristic length scale time-scales erosion diffusive soil creep advective stream incision equal length scale directly proportional valley spacing emerges numerical model landform evolution measured valley spacing five field sites results provide quantitative explanation one widely observed characteristics landscapes findings also imply valley spacing fundamental topographic signature records material properties climate regulate erosional processes
