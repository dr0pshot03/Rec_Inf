dendrite development regulated crest calcium-regulated transcriptional activator 
lasting effects neuronal activity brain development involve calcium-dependent gene expression using strategy called transactivator trap cloned calcium-responsive transactivator called crest calcium-responsive transactivator crest syt-related nuclear protein interacts adenosine -monophosphate camp response element binding protein creb-binding protein cbp expressed developing brain mice targeted disruption crest gene viable display defects cortical hippocampal dendrite development cortical neurons crest mutant mice compromised calcium-dependent dendritic growth thus calcium activation crest-mediated transcription helps regulate neuronal morphogenesis
