conformational changes ultrafast light-driven enzyme determine catalytic activity 
role conformational changes explaining huge catalytic power enzymes currently one challenging questions biology1- although now widely regarded enzymes modulate reaction rates means short long range protein motions3- almost impossible distinguish conformational changes catalysis solved problem using chlorophyll biosynthetic enzyme nadph: protochlorophyllide pchlide oxidoreductase catalyses unique light driven reaction involving hydride proton transfers8 report prior excitation enzyme substrate complex laser pulse induces favourable conformation active site enabling coupled hydride proton transfer reactions occur effect triggered pchlide excited-state lifetime persists long timescale switches enzyme active state characterized high rate quantum yield formation catalytic intermediate corresponding spectral changes mid infrared following absorption one photon reveal significant conformational changes enzyme illustrating importance flexibility dynamics structure enzymes function
