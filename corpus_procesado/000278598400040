lysosomal pathology osteopetrosis upon loss h+-driven lysosomal cl accumulation 
lysosomal acidification proton-pump currents thought shunted chloride ion cl- channel tentatively identified clc- surprisingly recent data suggest clc instead mediates cl-/proton h+ exchange generated mice carrying point mutation converting clc uncoupled unc cl conductor despite maintaining lysosomal conductance normal lysosomal ph clcn7unc/unc mice showed lysosomal storage disease like mice lacking clc- however osteopetrosis milder lacked coat color phenotype thus roles clc cl-/h+ exchange can taken cl conductance conductance even deleterious clcn7+/unc mice clcn7-/- clcn7unc/unc mice accumulated less cl lysosomes wild-type mice thus lowered lysosomal chloride may underlie common phenotypes
