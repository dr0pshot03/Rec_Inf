dendritic mechanisms underlying rapid synaptic activation fast-spiking hippocampal interneurons 
fast-spiking parvalbumin-expressing basket cells bcs important feedforward feedback inhibition network activity bcs respond short latency high temporal precision thought specific properties input synapses responsible rapid recruitment however potential contribution active dendritic conductances addressed combined confocal imaging patch-clamp techniques obtain simultaneous somatodendritic recordings bcs action potentials initiated bc axon backpropagated dendrites reduced amplitude little activity dependence properties explained high k+ na+ conductance ratio bc dendrites computational analysis indicated dendritic k+ channels convey unique integration properties bcs leading rapid temporally precise activation excitatory inputs
