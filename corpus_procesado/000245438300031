attosecond real-time observation electron tunnelling atoms 
atoms exposed intense light lose one electrons become ions strong fields process predicted occur via tunnelling binding potential suppressed light field near peaks oscillations report real-time observation elementary step strong-field interactions: light-induced electron tunnelling process found deplete atomic bound states sharp steps lasting several hundred attoseconds suggests new technique attosecond tunnelling probing short-lived transient states atoms molecules high temporal resolution utility attosecond tunnelling demonstrated capturing multi-electron excitation shake-up relaxation cascaded auger decay processes subfemtosecond resolution
