magnetization precession hot spin injection
electrons injected various energies ferromagnetic material spin polarization vector perpendicular axis magnetization observe precessional motion spin polarization femtosecond time scale angular momentum conservation magnetization vector must process well show spin injection will generate precessional magnetization reversal nanosized ferromagnetic bits reasonable injected current densities occurs picosecond time scale
