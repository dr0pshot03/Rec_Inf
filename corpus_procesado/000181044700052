repair dna damage essential maintaining genome integrity repair deficiencies mammals associated cancer neurological disease developmental defects alkylation damage dna repaired least three different mechanisms including damage reversal oxidative demethylation methyladenine methylcytosine escherichia coli alkb contrast little known consequences cellular handling alkylation damage rna show two human alkb homologues habh2 habh3 also oxidative dna demethylases alkb habh3 habh2 also repair rna whereas alkb habh3 prefer single-stranded nucleic acids habh2 acts efficiently double-stranded dna addition alkb habh3 expressed e coli reactivate methylated rna bacteriophage ms2 vivo illustrating biological relevance repair activity establishing rna repair potentially important defence mechanism living cells different catalytic properties different subnuclear localization patterns shown human homologues indicate habh2 habh3 distinct roles cellular response alkylation damage
