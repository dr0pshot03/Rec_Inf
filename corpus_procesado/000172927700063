klf6 candidate tumor suppressor gene mutated prostate cancer 
kruppel-like factor klf6 zinc finger transcription factor unknown function show klf6 gene mutated subset human prostate cancer loss-of-heterozygosity analysis revealed one klf6 allele deleted % primary prostate tumors sequence analysis retained klf6 allele revealed mutations % tumors functional studies confirm whereas wild-type klf6 up-regulates p21 waf1/cip1 p53-independent manner significantly reduces cell proliferation tumor-derived klf6 mutants data suggest klf6 tumor suppressor gene involved human prostate cancer
