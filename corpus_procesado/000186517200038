non-saturating magnetoresistance heavily disordered semiconductors
resistance homogeneous semiconductor increases quadratically magnetic field low fields except special cases saturates fields much larger inverse carrier mobility number typically order t refs surprising exception behaviour recently observed doped silver chalcogenides- exhibit anomalously large quasi-linear magnetoresistive response extends low fields survives even extreme fields t beyond present simple model macroscopically disordered strongly inhomogeneous semiconductor exhibits similar non-saturating magnetoresistance addition providing possible explanation behaviour doped silver chalcogenides model suggests potential routes construction magnetic field sensors large controllable linear response
