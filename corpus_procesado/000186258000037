genetics adult-onset neuropsychiatric disease: complexities conundra 
genetic factors play major role etiology adult-onset neurodegenerative neuropsychiatric disorders several highly penetrant genes cloned rare autosomal-dominant early-onset forms neurodegenerative diseases genes provided important insights mechanisms diseases often altering neuronal protein processing however genes associated inherited susceptibility late-onset neurodegenerative diseases schizophrenia bipolar disorder appear smaller effects likely interact nongenetic factors modulate susceptibility and/or disease phenotype several strategies recently applied address complexity leading identification number candidate susceptibility loci/genes
