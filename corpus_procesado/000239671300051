genome sequence diversity clues evolution variola smallpox virus 
comparative genomics epidemiologically varied variola virus isolates past years smallpox era indicate low sequence diversity suggesting probably little difference isolates functional gene content phylogenetic clustering inferred three clades coincident geographical origin case-fatality rate; latter implicated putative proteins mediate viral virulence differences analysis viral linear dna genome suggests evolution involved direct descent dna end-region recombination events knowing sequences will help understand viral proteome improve diagnostic test precision therapeutics systems assessment
