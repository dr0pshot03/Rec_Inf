high shear strain olivine aggregates: rheological seismic consequences 
high-pressure high-temperature torsion experiments olivine aggregates dislocation creep show % strain weakening steady-state behavior characterized subgrain-rotation recrystallization strong lattice preferred orientation weakening may provide way focus flow upper mantle without change deformation mechanism flow laws derived low strain data may appropriate use modeling high strain regions areas seismic wave propagation will anisotropic axis approximate rotational symmetry shear direction contrast current thinking anisotropy will indicate orientation shear plane highly strained recrystallized olivine-rich rocks
