stable single-unit-cell nanosheets zeolite mfi active long-lived catalysts
zeolites-microporous crystalline aluminosilicates-are widely used petrochemistry fine-chemical synthesis- strong acid sites within uniform micropores enable size shape-selective catalysis presence micropores aperture diameters nm often goes hand-in-hand diffusion limitations- adversely affect catalytic activity problem can overcome reducing thickness zeolite crystals reduces diffusion path lengths thus improves molecular diffusion realized synthesizing zeolite nanocrystals exfoliating layered zeolites- introducing mesopores microporous material templating strategies- demetallation processes- except exfoliation none strategies produced ultrathin zeolites thicknesses nm show appropriately designed bifunctional surfactants can direct formation zeolite structures themesoporous microporous length scales simultaneously thus yield mfi zsm- one important catalysts petrochemical industry zeolite nanosheets nm thick corresponds b-axis dimension single mfi unit cell large number acid sites external surface zeolites renders highly active catalytic conversion large organic molecules reduced crystal thickness facilitates diffusion thereby dramatically suppresses catalyst deactivation coke deposition methanol-to-gasoline conversion expect synthesis approach applied zeolites improve performance range important catalytic applications
