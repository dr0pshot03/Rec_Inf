chip-seq accurately predicts tissue-specific activity enhancers
major yet unresolved quest decoding human genome identification regulatory sequences control spatial temporal expression genes distant acting transcriptional enhancers particularly challenging uncover scattered among vast non coding portion genome evolutionary sequence constraint can facilitate discovery enhancers fails predict active vivo present results chromatin immunoprecipitation enhancer associated protein p300 followed massively parallel sequencing map several thousand vivo binding sites p300 mouse embryonic forebrain midbrain limb tissue tested sequences transgenic mouse assay nearly cases demonstrated reproducible enhancer activity tissues predicted p300 binding results indicate vivo mapping p300 binding highly accurate means identifying enhancers associated activities suggest data sets will useful study role tissue specific enhancers human biology disease genome wide scale
