calcium-bound structure calpain mechanism inhibition calpastatin
calpains non-lysosomal calcium-dependent cysteine proteinases selectively cleave proteins response calcium signals thereby control cellular functions cytoskeletal remodelling cell cycle progression gene expression apoptotic cell death- mammals two best-characterized members calpain family calpain calpain mu-calpain m-calpain respectively ubiquitously expressed activity calpains tightly controlled endogenous inhibitor calpastatin intrinsically unstructured protein capable reversibly binding inhibiting four molecules calpain presence calcium date mechanism inhibition calpastatin basis absolute specificity remained speculative- clear unstructured protein inhibits calpains without cleaved known calcium induced changes facilitated binding calpastatin calpain report -angstrom-resolution crystal structure calcium-bound calpain heterodimer bound one four inhibitory domains calpastatin calpastatin seen inhibit calpain occupying sides active site cleft although inhibitor passes active site cleft escapes cleavage novel manner looping around active site cysteine inhibitory domain calpastatin recognizes multiple lower affinity sites present calcium-bound form enzyme resulting interaction tight specific calcium dependent crystal structure related complex also reveal conformational changes calpain undergoes binding calcium include opening active site cleft movement domains relative produce compact enzyme
