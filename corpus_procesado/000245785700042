new perceptual illusion reveals mechanisms sensory decoding 
perceptual illusions usually thought arise way sensory signals encoded brain indeed often used infer mechanisms sensory encoding1 perceptual illusions might also result way brain decodes sensory information2 reflecting strategies optimize performance particular tasks fine discrimination task accurate information comes neurons tuned away discrimination boundary34 observers seem use signals displaced neurons optimize performance567 wondered whether using signals neurons might also bias perception fine direction discrimination task using moving random-dot stimuli found observers perception direction motion indeed biased away boundary misperception can accurately described decoding model preferentially weights signals neurons whose responses best discriminate directions coarse discrimination task different decoding rule applies4 stimulus misperceived suggesting illusion direct consequence decoding strategy observers use make fine perceptual judgments subjective experience motion therefore mediated directly responses sensory neurons developed responses neurons decoded
