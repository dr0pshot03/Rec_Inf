deterministic quantum teleportation atoms
teleportation quantum state encompasses complete transfer information one particle another complete specification quantum state system generally requires infinite amount information even simple two-level systems qubits moreover principles quantum mechanics dictate measurement system immediately alters state yielding one bit information transfer state one system another performing measurements first operations second might therefore appear impossible however shown entangling properties quantum mechanics combination classical communication allow quantum-state teleportation performed teleportation using pairs entangled photons demonstrated- techniques probabilistic requiring post-selection measured photons report deterministic quantum-state teleportation pair trapped calcium ions following closely original proposal create highly entangled pair ions perform complete bell-state measurement involving one ion pair third source ion state reconstruction conditioned measurement performed half entangled pair measured fidelity % demonstrating unequivocally quantum nature process
