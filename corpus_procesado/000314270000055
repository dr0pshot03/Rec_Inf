detecting ozone greenhouse gas-driven wind trends observational data 
modeling studies suggest antarctic ozone depletion lesser degree greenhouse gas ghg increase caused observed poleward shift westerly jet austral summer similar studies performed previously observational data difficulties separating two contributions applying cluster analysis daily era-interim data found two day wind clusters one resembling models responses ghg forcing resembling ozone depletion trends clusters frequency occurrence indicate ozone contributed % ghg toward jet shift supporting modeling results moreover tropical convection apparently plays important role ghg-driven trend
