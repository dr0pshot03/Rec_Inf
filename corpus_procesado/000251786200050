nanog safeguards pluripotency mediates germline development
nanog divergent homeodomain protein found mammalian pluripotent cells developing germ cells deletion nanog causes early embryonic lethality whereas constitutive expression enables autonomous self renewal embryonic stem cells nanog accordingly considered core element pluripotent transcriptional network- however report nanog fluctuates mouse embryonic stem cells transient downregulation nanog appears predispose cells towards differentiation mark commitment genetic deletion show although prone differentiate embryonic stem cells can self renew indefinitely permanent absence nanog expanded nanog null cells colonize embryonic germ layers exhibit multilineage differentiation fetal adult chimaeras although also recruited germ line primordial germ cells lacking nanog fail mature reaching genital ridge defect rescued repair mutant allele thus nanog dispensible expression somatic pluripotency specifically required formation germ cells nanog therefore acts primarily construction inner cell mass germ cell states rather housekeeping machinery pluripotency surmise nanog stabilizes embryonic stem cells culture resisting reversing alternative gene expression states
