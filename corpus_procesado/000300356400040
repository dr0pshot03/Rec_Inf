plate motions stresses global dynamic models 
delineating driving forces behind plate motions important understanding processes shaped earth throughout history however accurate prediction plate motions boundary-zone deformation rigidity stresses remains difficult frontier numerical modeling present global dynamic model produces good fit parameters accounting lateral viscosity variations top kilometers earth together forces associated topography lithosphere structure well coupling mantle flow relative importance shallow structure versus deeper mantle flow varies earths surface model reveals mantle flow contributes toward driving resisting plate motions furthermore subducted slabs need act strong stress guides satisfy global observations plate motions stress
