living lethal pip3 levels: viability flies lacking pten restored ph domain mutation akt/pkb 
phosphoinositide phosphatase pten mutated many human cancers although role pten studied extensively relative contributions numerous potential downstream effectors deregulated growth tumorigenesis remain uncertain provide genetic evidence drosophila melanogaster paramount importance protein kinase akt [also called protein kinase b pkb] mediating effects increased phosphatidylinositol -trisphosphate pip3 concentrations caused loss pten function mutation pleckstrin homology ph domain akt reduces affinity pip3 sufficed rescue lethality flies devoid pten activity thus akt appears critical target activated increased pip3 concentrations drosophila
