killing activity neutrophils mediated activation proteases k+ flux
according hitherto accepted view neutrophils kill ingested microorganisms subjecting high concentrations highly toxic reactive oxygen species ros bringing myeloperoxidase-catalysed halogenation show simple scheme many years served satisfactory working hypothesis inadequate find mice made deficient neutrophil-granule proteases normal respect superoxide production iodinating capacity unable resist staphylococcal candidal infections also show activation provokes influx enormous concentration ros endocytic vacuole resulting accumulation anionic charge compensated surge k+ ions cross membrane ph-dependent manner consequent rise ionic strength engenders release cationic granule proteins including elastase cathepsin g anionic sulphated proteoglycan matrix show proteases thus activated primarily responsible destruction bacteria
