invasive harlequin ladybird carries biological weapons native competitors
invasive species proliferate colonizing new habitats negative environmental economic impact reason species become successful invaders whereas others even closely related species remain noninvasive often unclear harlequin ladybird harmonia axyridis introduced biological pest control become invader outcompeting indigenous ladybird species many countries show harmonia carries abundant spores obligate parasitic microsporidia closely related nosema thompsoni microsporidia harming carrier harmonia lethal pathogens native ladybird coccinella septempunctata propose intraguild predation representing major selective force among competing ladybird species causes infection ultimate death native ladybirds feed microsporidia-contaminated harmonia eggs larvae
