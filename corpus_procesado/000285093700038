quantitative reactivity profiling predicts functional cysteines proteomes
cysteine intrinsically nucleophilic amino acid proteins reactivity tuned perform diverse biochemical functions absence consensus sequence defines functional cysteines proteins hindered discovery characterization describe proteomics method profile quantitatively intrinsic reactivity cysteine residues en masse directly native biological systems hyper-reactivity rare feature among cysteines found specify wide range activities including nucleophilic reductive catalysis sites oxidative modification hyper-reactive cysteines identified several proteins uncharacterized function including residue conserved across eukaryotic phylogeny show required yeast viability involved iron-sulphur protein biogenesis also demonstrate quantitative reactivity profiling can form basis screening functional assignment cysteines computationally designed proteins discriminated catalytically active inactive cysteine hydrolase designs
