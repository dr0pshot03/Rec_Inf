wnt dkk determine hair follicle spacing reaction-diffusion mechanism
mathematical reaction-diffusion models suggested describe formation animal pigmentation patterns distribution epidermal appendages however crucial signals vivo mechanisms still elusive identify wnt inhibitor dkk primary determinants murine hair follicle spacing using combined experimental computational modeling approach transgenic dkk overexpression reduces overall appendage density moderate suppression endogenous wnt signaling forces follicles form clusters otherwise normal morphogenetic program results confirm predictions wnt/dkk-specific mathematical model provide vivo corroboration reaction-diffusion mechanism epidermal appendage formation
