influence visual motion fast reaching movements stationary object
one important functions vision direct actions objects however every time vision used guide action retinal motion signals produced movement eye head person looks object motion objects scene reach object accurately visuomotor system must separate information position stationary target background retinal motion signals-a long-standing problem poorly understood- show visuomotor system distinguish two information sources: observers made fast reaching movements briefly presented stationary target hand shifted direction consistent motion distant unrelated stimulus result contrary findings can seen early hands trajectory similar to120 ms occurs continuously programming movement execution visuomotor system might make use motion signals arising eye head movements update positions targets rapidly redirect hand compensate body movements
