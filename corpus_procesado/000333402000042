visual space compressed prefrontal cortex eye movements
experience visual world series saccadic eye movements one shifting gaze bring objects interest fovea processing although movements lead frequent substantial displacements retinal image displacements go unnoticed widely assumed primary mechanism underlying apparent stability anticipatory shifting visual receptive fields rfs presaccadic post-saccadic locations movement onset evidence predictive remapping rfs particularly apparent within brain structures involved gaze control- however critically absent among evidence detailed measurements visual rfs movement onset show saccade preparation rather remap rfs neurons prefrontal gaze control area massively converge towards saccadic target mapped visual rfs prefrontal neurons stable fixation immediately onset eye movements using multi-electrode recordings monkeys following movements initial fixation point target rfs remained stationary retinocentric space however period immediately movement onset rfs shifted much degrees visual angle converged towards target location convergence resulted threefold increase proportion rfs responding stimuli near target region addition like human observers population prefrontal neurons grossly mislocalized presaccadic stimuli closer target results show rf shifts predict retinal displacements due saccades instead reflect overriding perception target space eye movements
