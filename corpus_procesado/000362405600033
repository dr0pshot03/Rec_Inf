finding optimal surface sites heterogeneous catalysts counting nearest neighbors
good heterogeneous catalyst given chemical reaction often one specific type surface site catalytically active widespread methodologies sabatier-type activity plots determine optimal adsorption energies maximize catalytic activity difficult use guidelines devise new catalysts introduce coordination-activity plots predict geometric structure optimal active sites method illustrated oxygen reduction reaction catalyzed platinum sites number first-nearest neighbors terraces increased number second-nearest neighbors predicted superior catalytic activity used rationale create highly active sites platinum without alloying using three different affordable experimental methods
