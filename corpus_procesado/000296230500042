torsional carbon nanotube artificial muscles 
rotary motors conventional design can rather complex therefore difficult miniaturize; previous carbon nanotube artificial muscles provide contraction bending rotation show electrolyte-filled twist-spun carbon nanotube yarn much thinner human hair functions torsional artificial muscle simple three-electrode electrochemical system providing reversible degrees rotation revolutions per minute hydrostatic actuation mechanism seen muscular hydrostats nature explains simultaneous occurrence lengthwise contraction torsional rotation yarn volume increase caused electrochemical double-layer charge injection use torsional yarn muscle mixer fluidic chip demonstrated
