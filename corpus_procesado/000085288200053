altered brain response verbal learning following sleep deprivation
effects sleep deprivation neural substrates cognition poorly understood used functional magnetic resonance imaging measure effects hours sleep deprivation cerebral activation verbal learning normal young volunteers basis previous hypothesis predicted prefrontal cortex pfc less responsive cognitive demands following sleep deprivation contrary expectations however pfc responsive one night sleep deprivation normal sleep increased subjective sleepiness sleep-deprived subjects correlated significantly activation pfc temporal lobe activated normal sleep sleep deprivation contrast parietal lobes activated normal sleep activated sleep deprivation although sleep deprivation significantly impaired free recall compared rested state better free recall sleep-deprived subjects associated greater parietal lobe activation findings show dynamic compensatory changes cerebral activation verbal learning sleep deprivation implicate pfc parietal lobes compensation
