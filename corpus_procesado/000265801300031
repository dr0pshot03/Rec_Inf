self-assembly nanoscale dna box controllable lid 
unique structural motifs self-recognition properties dna can exploited generate self-assembling dna nanostructures specific shapes using bottom-up approach several assembly strategies developed building complex three-dimensional 3d dna nanostructures- recently dna origami method used build two-dimensional addressable dna structures arbitrary shape can used platforms arrange nanomaterials high precision specificity- long-term goal field construct fully addressable 3d dna nanostructures extend dna origami method three dimensions creating addressable dna box x x nm size can opened presence externally supplied dna keys thoroughly characterize structure dna box using cryogenic transmission electron microscopy small-angle x-ray scattering atomic force microscopy use fluorescence resonance energy transfer optically monitor opening lid controlled access interior compartment dna nanocontainer yield several interesting applications example logic sensor multiple-sequence signals controlled release nanocargos
