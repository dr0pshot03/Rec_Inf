link communities reveal multiscale complexity networks
networks become key approach understanding systems interacting objects unifying study diverse phenomena including biological organisms human society- one crucial step studying structure dynamics networks identify communities: groups related nodes correspond functional subunits protein complexes social spheres- communities networks often overlap nodes simultaneously belong several groups meanwhile many networks known possess hierarchical organization communities recursively grouped hierarchical structure- however fact many real networks communities pervasive overlap every node belongs one group consequence global hierarchy nodes capture relationships overlapping groups reinvent communities groups links rather nodes show unorthodox approach successfully reconciles antagonistic organizing principles overlapping communities hierarchy contrast existing literature entirely focused grouping nodes link communities naturally incorporate overlap revealing hierarchical organization find relevant link communities many networks including major biological networks protein-protein interaction metabolic networks show large social network contains hierarchically organized community structures spanning inner-city regional scales maintaining pervasive overlap results imply link communities fundamental building blocks reveal overlap hierarchical organization networks two aspects phenomenon
