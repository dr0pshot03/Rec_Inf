memory b-cell persistence independent persisting immunizing antigen 
immunological memory antibody system generated t-cell-dependent responses carried long-lived memory b cells recognize antigen high-affinity antibodies remains controversial whether b cells represent true memory cells maintenance independent immunizing antigen whether product chronic immune response driven immunizing antigen can retained organism extended time periods surface specialized antigen-presenting cells follicular dendritic cells cell transfer experiments provided evidence favour role immunizing antigen however analysis memory cells intact animals showed cells mostly resting can persist absence detectable t-cell help follicular dendritic cells argued show using genetic switch mediated cre recombinase memory b cells switching antibody specificity away immunizing antigen indeed maintained animal long periods time similar cells retaining original antigen-binding specificity
