high tensile ductility nanostructured metal 
nanocrystalline metals-with grain sizes less nm-have strengths exceeding coarse-grained even alloyed metals thus expected many applications example pure nanocrystalline cu refs yield strength excess mpa six times higher coarse-grained cu nanocrystalline materials often exhibit low tensile ductility room temperature limits practical utility elongation failure typically less per cent regime uniform deformation even smaller- describe thermomechanical treatment cu results bimodal grain size distribution micrometre-sized grains embedded inside matrix nanocrystalline ultrafine < nm grains matrix grains impart high strength expected extrapolation hall-petch relationship meanwhile inhomogeneous microstructure induces strain hardening mechanisms- stabilize tensile deformation leading high tensile ductility-% elongation failure % uniform elongation expect results will implications development tough nanostructured metals forming operations high-performance structural applications including microelectromechanical biomedical systems
