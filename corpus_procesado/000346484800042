reconstruction control time-dependent two-electron wave packet
concerted motion two bound electrons governs atomic molecular non-equilibrium processes including chemical reactions hence much interest developing detailed understanding electron dynamics quantum regime however exact solution quantum three-body problem result even minimal system two active electrons nucleus analytically intractable makes experimental measurements dynamics two bound correlated electrons found helium atom attractive prospect however although motion single active electrons holes observed attosecond time resolution- comparable experiments two-electron motion far remained reach show correlated two-electron wave packet can reconstructed -femtosecond quantum beat among low-lying doubly excited states helium beat appears attosecond transient-absorption spectra- measured unprecedentedly high spectral resolution presence intensity-tunable visible laser field tune coupling- two low-lying quantum states adjusting visible laser intensity use fano resonance phase-sensitive quantum interferometer achieve coherent control two correlated electrons given excellent agreement large-scalequantum-mechanical calculations helium atom anticipate multidimensional spectroscopy experiments type report will provide benchmark data testing fundamental few-body quantum dynamics theory complex systems might also provide route site-specific measurement control metastable electronic transition states heart fundamental chemical reactions
