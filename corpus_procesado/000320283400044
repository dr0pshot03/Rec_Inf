small effect water upper-mantle rheology based silicon self-diffusion coefficients 
water thought affect dynamical processes earths interior great extent particular experimental deformation results- suggest even tens parts per million water weight enhances creep rates olivine orders magnitude however deformation studies limitations considering limited range water concentrations high stresses might affect results rock deformation can also understood effect silicon self-diffusion creep rates minerals temperatures high earths interior limited self-diffusion slowest species experimentally determine silicon self-diffusion coefficient d-si forsterite gpa k k function water content c-h2o less parts per million water weight yielding relationship d-si approximate c-h2o/ exponent strikingly lower obtained deformation experiments ref high nominal creep rates deformation studies wet conditions may caused excess grain boundary water conclude effect water upper-mantle rheology small hence smooth motion earths tectonic plates caused mineral hydration asthenosphere also water cause viscosity minimum zone upper mantle finally dominant mechanism responsible hotspot immobility water content differences source surrounding regions
