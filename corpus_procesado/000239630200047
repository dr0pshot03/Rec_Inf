microstimulation inferotemporal cortex influences face categorization 
inferior temporal cortex primates thought final visual area ventral stream cortical areas responsible object recognition consistent hypothesis single neurons respond selectively highly complex visual stimuli faces- however direct causal link activity face selective neurons face perception demonstrated present study macaque monkeys artificially activated small clusters neurons means electrical microstimulation monkeys performed categorization task judging whether noisy visual images belonged face non face categories show microstimulation face-selective sites sites strongly biased monkeys decisions towards face category magnitude effect depended upon degree face selectivity stimulation site size stimulated cluster face selective neurons exact timing microstimulation results establish causal relationship activity face selective neurons face perception
