replisome uses mrna primer colliding rna polymerase
replication forks impeded dna damage protein nucleic acid complexes transcribing rna polymerase example head collision replisome rna polymerase results replication fork arrest however co directional collision replisome rna polymerase little effect fork progression examine co directional collisions replisome rna polymerase vitro show escherichia coli replisome uses rnatranscript primer continue leading strand synthesis collision rna polymerase displaced dna action results discontinuity leading strand yet replisome remains intact bound dna entire process findings underscore notable plasticity replisome operates circumvent obstacles path may explain leading strand synthesized discontinuously vivo
