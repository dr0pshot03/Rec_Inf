subtractive patterning via chemical lift-off lithography
conventional soft-lithography methods involving transfer molecular inks polymeric stamps substrates often encounter micrometer-scale resolution limits due diffusion transferred molecules printing report subtractive stamping process silicone rubber stamps activated oxygen plasma selectively remove hydroxyl-terminated alkanethiols self-assembled monolayers sams gold surfaces high pattern fidelity covalent interactions formed stamp-substrate interface sufficiently strong remove alkanethiol molecules also gold atoms substrate variety high-resolution patterned features fabricated stamps cleaned reused many times without feature deterioration remaining sam acted resist etching exposed gold features monolayer backfilling lift-off areas enabled patterned protein capture nanometer chemical patterns achieved
