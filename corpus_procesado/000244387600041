gene body-specific methylation active x chromosome
differential dna methylation important epigenetic regulation gene expression allele-specific methylation inactive x chromosome demonstrated promoter cpg islands overall pattern methylation active x xa inactive x xi chromosomes unknown performed allele-specific analysis informative loci along human x chromosome xa displays two times much allele-specific methylation xi methylation concentrated gene bodies affecting multiple neighboring cpgs x inactivation xa gene body-methylated sites biallelically methylated thus bipartite methylation-demethylation program results xa-specific hypomethylation gene promoters hypermethylation gene bodies results suggest relationship global methylation expression potentiality
