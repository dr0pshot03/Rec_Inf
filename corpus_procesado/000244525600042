vivo imaging germinal centres reveals dynamic open structure 
germinal centres specialized structures wherein b lymphocytes undergo clonal expansion class switch recombination antibody gene diversification affinity maturation three four antigen-specific b cells colonize follicle establish germinal centre become rapidly dividing germinal-centre centroblasts give rise dark zones- centroblasts produce non-proliferating centrocytes thought migrate light zone germinal centre rich antigen-trapping follicular dendritic cells cd4+ t cells- proposed centrocytes selected light zone basis ability bind cognate antigen- however studies germinal-centre dynamics migratory behaviour germinal-centre cells vivo report direct visualization b cells lymph node germinal centres two-photon laser-scanning microscopy mice nearly antigen-specific b cells participating germinal-centre reaction motile physically restricted germinal centre migrated bidirectionally dark light zones notably follicular b cells frequent visitors germinal-centre compartment suggesting b cells scan antigen trapped germinal centres consistent observation found high-affinity antigen-specific b cells can recruited ongoing germinal-centre reaction conclude open structure germinal centres enhances competition ensures rare high-affinity b cells can participate antibody responses
