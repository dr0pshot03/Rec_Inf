bismuth embrittlement copper atomic size effect 
embrittlement segregation impurity elements grain boundaries one small number phenomena can lead metallurgical failure fast fracture settle question debated hundred years: can minute traces bismuth copper cause ductile metal fail brittle manner three hypotheses bi embrittlement cu exist: two assign electronic effect either strengthening weakening bonds third postulates simple atomic size effect report first principles quantum mechanical calculations allow us reject electronic hypotheses supporting size effect show upon segregation grain boundary large bi atoms weaken interatomic bonding pushing apart cu atoms interface resolution mechanism underlying grain boundary weakening relevant cases embrittlement oversize impurities
