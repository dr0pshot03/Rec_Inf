reducing endogenous tau ameliorates amyloid beta-induced deficits alzheimers disease mouse model
many potential treatments alzheimers disease target amyloid-beta peptides beta widely presumed cause disease microtubule-associated protein tau also involved disease unclear whether treatments aimed tau block beta-induced cognitive impairments found reducing endogenous tau levels prevented behavioral deficits transgenic mice expressing human amyloid precursor protein without altering high beta levels tau reduction also protected transgenic nontransgenic mice excitotoxicity thus tau reduction can block beta excitotoxin-induced neuronal dysfunction may represent effective strategy treating alzheimers disease related conditions
