histone acetylation switch regulates h2az deposition swr-c remodeling enzyme 
histone variant h2az plays key roles gene expression dna repair centromere function h2az deposition controlled swr-c chromatin remodeling enzymes catalyze nucleosomal exchange canonical h2a h2az report acetylation histone h3 lysine h3-k56ac alters substrate specificity swr-c leading promiscuous dimer exchange either h2az h2a can exchanged nucleosomes result confirmed vivo genome-wide analysis demonstrated widespread decreases h2az levels yeast mutants hyperacetylated h3k56 work also suggests conserved swr-c subunit may function lock prevents removal h2az nucleosomes study identifies histone modification regulates chromatin remodeling reaction provides insights histone variants nucleosome turnover can controlled chromatin regulators
