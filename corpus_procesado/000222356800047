resilient circadian oscillator revealed individual cyanobacteria 
circadian oscillators provide internal daily periodicity found variety living organisms including mammals insects plants fungi cyanobacteria remarkably biochemical oscillators resilient external internal modifications temperature cell division cycles fluctuation noise resistant relative fluctuations number messenger rna protein molecules forming intracellular oscillators likely large multicellular organisms strong temporal stability circadian clocks despite molecular fluctuations can easily explained intercellular interactions- study circadian rhythms stability unicellular cyanobacteria synechoccocus elongatus low-light-level microscopy allowed us measure gene expression circadian control single bacteria showing circadian clock indeed property individual cells measurements show oscillators strong temporal stability correlation time several months contrast many circadian clocks multicellular organisms stability seems ensured intracellular biochemical network interactions oscillators seem negligible
