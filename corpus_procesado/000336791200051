sleep promotes branch-specific formation dendritic spines learning
sleep helps learning memory remains unknown report mouse motor cortex sleep motor learning promotes formation postsynaptic dendritic spines subset branches individual layer v pyramidal neurons new spines formed different sets dendritic branches response different learning tasks protected eliminated multiple tasks learned neurons activated learning motor task reactivated subsequent non-rapid eye movement sleep disrupting neuronal reactivation prevents branch-specific spine formation findings indicate sleep key role promoting learning-dependent synapse formation maintenance selected dendritic branches contribute memory storage
