representation perceived object shape human lateral occipital complex
human lateral occipital complex loc implicated object recognition unknown whether region represents low-level image features perceived object shape used event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging adaptation paradigm response pairs successively presented stimuli tower identical different adaptation across change two stimuli pair provides evidence common neural representation invariant change found adaptation loc perceived shape identical contours differed contours identical perceived shape differed data indicate loc represents simple image features rather higher level shape information
