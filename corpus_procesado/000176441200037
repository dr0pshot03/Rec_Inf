oligodendrocyte-myelin glycoprotein nogo receptor ligand inhibits neurite outgrowth 
inhibitory activity associated myelin major obstacle successful axon regeneration adult mammalian central nervous system cns addition myelin-associated glycoprotein mag nogo-a- available evidence suggests existence additional inhibitors cns myelin show glycosylphosphatidylinositol gpi-anchored cns myelin protein oligodendrocyte-myelin glycoprotein omgp potent inhibitor neurite outgrowth cultured neurons like nogo-a omgp contributes significantly inhibitory activity associated cns myelin elucidate mechanisms mediate inhibitory activity omgp screened expression library identified nogo receptor ngr high-affinity omgp-binding protein cleavage ngr gpi-linked proteins cell surface renders axons dorsal root ganglia insensitive omgp introduction exogenous ngr confers omgp responsiveness otherwise insensitive neurons thus omgp important inhibitor neurite outgrowth acts ngr associated receptor complex interfering omgp/ngr pathway may allow lesioned axons regenerate injury vivo
