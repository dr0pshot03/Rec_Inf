epigenetic role maternally inherited pirnas transposon silencing
plants mammals small rnas indirectly mediate epigenetic inheritance specifying cytosine methylation found small rnas serve vectors epigenetic information crosses drosophila strains differ presence particular transposon can produce sterile progeny phenomenon called hybrid dysgenesis phenotype manifests transposon paternally inherited suggesting maternal transmission factor maintains fertility p element mediated hybrid dysgenesis models daughters show markedly different content piwi interacting rnas pirnas targeting element depending parents origin differences persist fertilization adulthood indicates maternally deposited pirnas important mounting effective silencing response lack maternal pirna inheritance underlies hybrid dysgenesis
