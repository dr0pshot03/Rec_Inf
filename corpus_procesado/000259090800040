inhibition shoot branching new terpenoid plant hormones
shoot branching major determinant plant architecture highly regulated endogenous environmental cues two classes hormones auxin cytokinin long known important involvement controlling shoot branching previous studies using series mutants enhanced shoot branching suggested existence third class hormone s derived carotenoids chemical identity unknown show levels strigolactones group terpenoid lactones significantly reduced branching mutants furthermore application strigolactones inhibits shoot branching mutants strigolactones previously found root exudates acting communication chemicals parasitic weeds symbiotic arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi thus propose strigolactones act new hormone class biosynthetic precursors regulating ground plant architecture also function underground communication neighbouring organisms
