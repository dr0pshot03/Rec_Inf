quasicrystalline structures may optical bandgap properties-frequency ranges propagation light forbidden-that make well-suited scientific technological applications photonic crystals1- normally considered4 quasicrystals can constructed two types dielectric material arranged quasiperiodic pattern whose rotational symmetry forbidden periodic crystals five-fold symmetry plane icosahedral symmetry three dimensions quasicrystals higher point group symmetry ordinary crystals gap centre frequencies closer gaps widths uniform-optimal conditions forming complete bandgap closely spherically symmetric although previous studies focused one-dimensional two-dimensional quasicrystals4- exact one-dimensional approximate two-dimensional band structures can calculated numerically analogous calculations three-dimensional case computationally challenging yet performed circumvent computational problem experiment using stereolithography construct photonic quasicrystal centimetre-scale cells perform microwave transmission measurements show three-dimensional icosahedral quasicrystals exhibit sizeable stop gaps despite quasi-periodicity yield uncomplicated spectra allow us experimentally determine faces effective brillouin zones studies confirm excellent candidates photonic bandgap materials
