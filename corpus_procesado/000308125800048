extreme bendability dna less base pairs long revealed single-molecule cyclization 
classical view dna posits dna must stiff persistence length [< base pairs bp] recent studies addressing yielded contradictory results developed fluorescence-based protein-free assay studying cyclization single dna molecules real time assay samples equilibrium population sharply bent transient species entirely suppressed single-molecule mechanical measurements biologically relevant annealed species sampled traditional ligase-based assay looping rate weak length dependence bp described worm-like chain model many biologically important protein-dna interactions involve looping bending dna bp likely use intrinsic bendability dna
