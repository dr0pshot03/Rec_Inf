mantle fault zone beneath kilauea volcano hawaii
relocations focal mechanism analyses deep earthquakes greater equal to13 kilometers kilauea volcano demonstrate seismicity focused active fault zone kilometer depth seaward slip low-angle plane smaller distinct fault zones earthquakes analyzed predominantly reflect tectonic faulting brittle lithosphere rather magma movement associated volcanic activity tectonic earthquakes may induced preexisting faults stresses magmatic origin although background stresses volcano loading lithospheric flexure may also contribute
