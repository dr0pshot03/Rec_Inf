possible solar origin -year glacial climate cycle demonstrated coupled model 
many palaeoclimate records north atlantic region show pattern rapid climate oscillations so-called dansgaard oeschger events quasi-periodicity similar years late glacial period- various hypotheses suggested explain rapid temperature shifts including internal oscillations climate system external forcing possibly sun whereas pronounced solar cycles similar similar years well known- similar -year solar cycle detected show intermediate-complexity climate model glacial climate conditions simulates rapid climate shifts similar dansgaard oeschger events spacing years forced periodic freshwater input north atlantic ocean cycles years attribute robust -year response time superposition two shorter cycles together strongly nonlinear dynamics long characteristic timescale thermohaline circulation holocene conditions similar events occur conclude glacial -year climate cycles triggered solar forcing despite absence -year solar cycle
