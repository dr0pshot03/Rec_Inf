intraprotein radical transfer photoactivation dna photolyase 
amino-acid radicals play key roles many enzymatic reactions1 catalysis often involves transfer radical character within protein class ribonucleotide reductase radical transfer occurs angstrom tyrosyl radical cysteine1- currently debated whether kind long-range transfer occurs electron transfer followed proton release create neutral radical h-atom transfer simultaneous transfer electrons protons4- latter mechanism avoids energetic cost charge formation low dielectric protein45 less robust structural changes electron transfer7 available experimental data clearly discriminate proposals studied mechanism photoactivation light-induced reduction flavin adenine dinucleotide cofactor escherichia coli dna photolyase8- using time-resolved absorption spectroscopy show excited flavin adenine dinucleotide radical abstracts electron nearby tryptophan ps subsequent electron transfer along chain three tryptophans remote tryptophan cation radical releases proton solvent ns showing electron transfer occurs proton dissociation similar process may take place photolyase-like blue-light receptors
