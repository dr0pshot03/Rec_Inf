dissecting self-renewal stem cells rna interference 
present integrated approach identify genetic mechanisms control self-renewal mouse embryonic stem cells use short hairpin rna shrna loss-of-function techniques downregulate set gene products whose expression patterns suggest self-renewal regulatory functions focus transcriptional regulators identify seven genes shrna-mediated depletion negatively affects self-renewal including four genes previously unrecognized roles self-renewal perturbations gene products combined dynamic global analyses gene expression studies suggest specific biological roles molecules reveal complexity cell fate regulation embryonic stem cells
