basomedial amygdala mediates top-down control anxiety fear
nxiety-related conditions among difficult neuropsychiatric diseases treat pharmacologically respond cognitive therapies therefore interest identifying relevant top-down pathways cognitive control regions medial prefrontal cortex mpfc identification pathways contribute understanding cognitive regulation affect provide pathways intervention previous studies suggested dorsal ventral mpfc subregions exert opposing effects fear subregions structures however precise causal targets top-down connections among diverse possibilities established show basomedial amygdala bma represents major target ventral mpfc amygdala mice moreover bma neurons differentiate safe aversive environments bma activation decreases fear-related freezing high-anxiety states lastly show ventral mpfc-bma projection implements top-down control anxiety state learned freezing baseline stress-induced anxiety defining broadly relevant new top-down behavioural regulation pathway
