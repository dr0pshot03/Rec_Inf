tumour exosome integrins determine organotropic metastasis 
ever since stephen pagets hypothesis metastatic organotropism remained one cancers greatest mysteries demonstrate exosomes mouse human lung- liver-and brain-tropic tumour cells fuse preferentially resident cells predicted destination namely lung fibroblasts epithelial cells liver kupffer cells brain endothelial cells show tumour-derived exosomes uptaken organ-specific cells prepare pre-metastatic niche treatment exosomes lung-tropic models redirected metastasis bone-tropic tumour cells exosome proteomics revealed distinct integrin expression patterns exosomal integrins alpha6beta4 alpha6beta1 associated lung metastasis exosomal integrin alphavbeta5 linked liver metastasis targeting integrins alpha6beta4 alphavbeta5 decreased exosome uptake well lung liver metastasis respectively demonstrate exosome integrin uptake resident cells activates src phosphorylation pro-inflammatory s100 gene expression finally clinical data indicate exosomal integrins used predict organ-specific metastasis
