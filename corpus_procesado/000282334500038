identifying driver pulsating aurora
pulsating aurora spectacular emission appears blinking upper atmosphere polar regions known excited modulated downward-streaming electrons despite distinctive feature identifying driver electron precipitation long-standing problem using coordinated satellite ground-based all-sky imager observations themis mission provide direct evidence naturally occurring electromagnetic wave lower-band chorus can drive pulsating aurora waves given equatorial location space correlate single pulsating auroral patch upper atmosphere findings can also used constrain magnetic field models much higher accuracy previously possible
