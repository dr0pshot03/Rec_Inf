striped iron zoning olivine induced dislocation creep deformed peridotites 
deformation solid materials affects microstructures also microchemistries- although chemical unmixing initially homogeneous multicomponent solids known occur deformation diffusion creep report chemical zoning due deformation dislocation creep either natural samples laboratory experiments report striped iron zoning olivine mgfesio4 deformed peridotites iron concentration increases subgrain boundaries composed edge dislocations infer zoning probably formed alignment edge dislocations dragging so-called cottrell atmosphere solute atoms iron case subgrain boundaries deformation olivine dislocation creep found iron zoning develop laboratory experiments high strain rates dislocations move fast drag cottrell atmosphere phenomenon might important implications generation deep-focus earthquakes transformation olivine high-pressure phases preferentially occurs high-iron regions therefore along subgrain boundaries preferentially aligned plastically deformed mantle peridotites
