brain tumour cells interconnect functional resistant network
astrocytic brain tumours including glioblastomas incurable neoplasms characterized diffusely infiltrative growth show many tumour cells astrocytomas extend ultra-long membrane protrusions use distinct tumour microtubes routes brain invasion proliferation interconnect long distances resulting network allows multicellular communication microtube-associated gap junctions damage network occurred tumour microtubes used repair moreover microtube-connected astrocytoma cells remaining unconnected throughout tumour progression protected cell death inflicted radiotherapy neuronal growth-associated protein important microtube formation function drove microtube-dependent tumour cell invasion proliferation interconnection radioresistance oligodendroglial brain tumours deficient mechanism summary astrocytomas can develop functional multicellular network structures disconnection astrocytoma cells targeting tumour microtubes emerges new principle reduce treatment resistance disease
