although astrocytes constitute nearly half cells brain function long-standing neurobiological mystery show quantal analyses fm1- imaging immunostaining electron microscopy synapses form absence glial cells synapses form functionally immature astrocytes increase number mature functional synapses central nervous system cns neurons sevenfold required synaptic maintenance vitro also show synapses generated concurrently development glia vivo data demonstrate previously unknown function glia inducing stabilizing cns synapses show cns synapse number can profoundly regulated nonneuronal signals raise possibility glia may actively participate synaptic plasticity
