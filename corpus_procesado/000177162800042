re-examination proximodistal patterning vertebrate limb development 
progress zone model provides framework understanding progressive development vertebrate limb model holds undifferentiated cells zone fixed size distal tip limb bud progress zone undergo progressive change positional information specification altered proximal distal fates positional change thought driven internal clock kept active long cells remain progress zone however owing cell division proximal cells continually pushed outside confines zone exit clock function ceases cells become fixed positional value last attained within zone contrast model data suggest various limb segments specified early limb development distinct domains subsequent development involving expansion progenitor populations differentiation also find however distal limb mesenchyme becomes progressively determined irreversibly fixed progressively limited range potential proximodistal fates
