lightning-induced intensification ionospheric sporadic e layer
connection thunderstorms ionosphere hypothesized since mid-1920s several mechanisms proposed explain connection- evidence modelling well various types measurements- demonstrate lightning can interact lower ionosphere proposed basis observed events ionospheric sporadic e layer transient localized patches relatively high electron density mid-ionosphere e layer significantly affect radio-wave propagation can modulated thunderstorms formal statistical analysis still needed identify statistically significant intensification descent altitude mid-latitude sporadic e layer directly thunderstorms ionospheric response low-pressure systems without lightning detected conclude localized intensification sporadic e layer can attributed lightning suggest co-location lightning ionospheric enhancement can explained either vertically propagating gravity waves transfer energy site lightning ionosphere vertical electrical discharge combination two mechanisms
