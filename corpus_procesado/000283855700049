fate mapping analysis reveals adult microglia derive primitive macrophages 
microglia resident macrophages central nervous system associated pathogenesis many neurodegenerative brain inflammatory diseases however origin adult microglia remains controversial show postnatal hematopoietic progenitors significantly contribute microglia homeostasis adult brain contrast many macrophage populations show microglia develop mice lack colony stimulating factor csf- absent csf receptor-deficient mice vivo lineage tracing studies established adult microglia derive primitive myeloid progenitors arise embryonic day results identify microglia ontogenically distinct population mononuclear phagocyte system implications use embryonically derived microglial progenitors treatment various brain disorders
