generation medaka fish haploid embryonic stem cells 
haploid embryonic stem es cells combine haploidy pluripotency enabling direct genetic analyses recessive phenotypes vertebrate cells haploid cells elusive culture due inferior growth genomic instability generated gynogenetic medaka embryos obtained three haploid es cell lines retained pluripotency competitive growth upon nuclear transfer unfertilized oocytes haploid es cells even genetic engineering generated viable offspring capable germline transmission hence haploid medaka es cells stably maintain normal growth pluripotency genomic integrity mosaic oocytes created combining mitotic nucleus meiotic nucleus can generate fertile fish offspring haploid es cells may offer yeast-like system analyzing recessive phenotypes numerous cell lineages vertebrates vitro
