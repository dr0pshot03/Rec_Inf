fkf1f-box protein mediates cyclic degradation repressor constans arabidopsis 
temporal control constans co expression activity key mechanism photoperiodic flowering arabidopsis flavin-binding kelch repeat f-box fkf1 protein regulates co transcription although molecular mechanism unknown demonstrate fkf1 controls stability dof transcription factor cycling dof factor cdf1 fkf1 physically interacts cdf1 cdf1 protein stable fkf1 mutants plants elevated levels cdf1 flower late reduced expression co cdf1 co expressed tissues cdf1 binds co promoter thus fkf1 controls daily co expression part degrading cdf1 repressor co transcription
