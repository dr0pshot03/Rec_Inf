optical sectioning deep inside live embryos selective plane illumination microscopy 
large living biological specimens present challenges existing optical imaging techniques absorptive scattering properties developed selective plane illumination microscopy spim generate multidimensional images samples millimeters size system combines two-dimensional illumination orthogonal camera-based detection achieve high-resolution optically sectioned imaging throughout sample minimal photodamage speeds capable capturing transient biological phenomena used spim visualize muscles vivo transgenic medaka line arnie expresses green fluorescent protein muscle tissue also demonstrate spim can applied visualize embryogenesis relatively opaque drosophila melanogaster vivo
