oversimplifying quantum factoring 
shors quantum factoring algorithm exponentially outperforms known classical methods previous experimental implementations used simplifications dependent knowing factors advance however show composite numbers admit simplification algorithm circuit equivalent flipping coins difficulty particular experiment therefore depends level simplification chosen size number factored valid implementations make use answer sought
