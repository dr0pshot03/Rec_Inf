enhanced cpg mutability tumorigenesis mbd4-deficient mice
mammalian protein mbd4 contains methyl-cpg binding domain can enzymatically remove thymine t uracil u mismatched cpg site vitro properties suggest mbd4 might function vivo minimize mutability methylcytosine removing deamination product dna tested hypothesis analyzing mbd4-/- mice found frequency c t transitions cpg sites increased factor three cancer-susceptible apcmin/+ background mbd4-/- mice showed accelerated tumor formation cpg -> tpg mutations apc gene thus mbd4 suppresses cpg mutability tumorigenesis vivo
