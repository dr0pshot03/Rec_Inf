cleaning air improving health hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles
converting us onroad vehicles hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles hfcvs may improve air quality health climate significantly whether hydrogen produced steam reforming natural gas wind electrolysis coal gasification benefits result eliminating current vehicle exhaust wind natural gas hfcvs offer greatest potential health benefits save us lives annually wind hfcvs benefit climate all-hfcv fleet hardly affect tropospheric water vapor concentrations conversion coal hfcvs may improve health damage climate fossil/electric hybrids real cost hydrogen wind electrolysis may us gasoline
