myocardial infarction accelerates atherosclerosis 
progression atherosclerosis myeloid cells destabilize lipid-rich plaques arterial wall cause rupture thus triggering myocardial infarction stroke survivors acute coronary syndromes high risk recurrent events unknown reasons show systemic response ischaemic injury aggravates chronic atherosclerosis myocardial infarction stroke apoe-/- mice developed larger atherosclerotic lesions advanced morphology disease acceleration persisted many weeks associated markedly increased monocyte recruitment seeking source surplus monocytes plaques found myocardial infarction liberated haematopoietic stem progenitor cells bone marrow niches via sympathetic nervous system signalling progenitors seeded spleen yielding sustained boost monocyte production observations provide new mechanistic insight atherogenesis provide novel therapeutic opportunity mitigate disease progression
