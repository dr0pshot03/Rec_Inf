mitochondrial reticulum cellular energy distribution muscle 
intracellular energy distribution attracted much interest proposed occur skeletal muscle via metabolite-facilitated diffusion however genetic evidence suggests facilitated diffusion critical normal function- hypothesized mitochondrial structure minimizes metabolite diffusion distances skeletal muscle demonstrate mitochondrial reticulum providing conductive pathway energy distribution form proton-motive force throughout mouse skeletal muscle cell within reticulum find proteins associated mitochondrial proton-motive force production preferentially cell periphery proteins use proton-motive force atp production cell interior near contractile transport atpases furthermore show rapid coordinated depolarization membrane potential component proton-motive force throughout cell response spatially controlled uncoupling cell interior propose membrane potential conduction via mitochondrial reticulum dominant pathway skeletal muscle energy distribution
