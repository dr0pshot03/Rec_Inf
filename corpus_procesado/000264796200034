early assembly massive galaxies 
current consensus galaxies begin small density fluctuations early universe grow situ star formation hierarchical merging stars begin form relatively quickly sub-galactic-sized building blocks called haloes subsequently assembled galaxies however exactly assembly takes place matter debate report stellar masses brightest cluster galaxies luminous objects emitting stellar light billion years ago significantly different stellar masses today brightest cluster galaxies almost fully assembled billion years big bang grown per cent final stellar mass time data conflict recent galaxy formation models based largest simulations dark-matter halo development models predict protracted formation brightest cluster galaxies hubble time per cent stellar mass assembled epoch probed sample findings suggest new picture brightest cluster galaxies experience early period rapid growth rather prolonged hierarchical assembly
