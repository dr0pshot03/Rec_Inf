ion-mediated electron transfer supramolecular donor-acceptor ensemble 
ion binding often mediates electron transfer biological systems cofactor strategy either promoter inhibitor however rarely ever exploited purpose synthetic host-guest assemblies report strong binding specific anions chloride bromide methylsulfate tetrafluoroborate hexafluorophosphate tetrathiafulvalene calix[]pyrrole ttf-c4p donor enforces host conformation favors electron transfer bisimidazolium quinone biq+ guest acceptor contrast addition tetraethylammonium cation binds effectively biq+ guest ttf-c4p cavity leads back electron transfer restoring initial oxidation states donor acceptor pair products processes characterized via spectroscopy x-ray crystallography
