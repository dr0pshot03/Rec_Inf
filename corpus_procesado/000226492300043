speciation distance ring species 
ring species consist two reproductively isolated forms connected chain intergrading populations often described examples speciation despite gene flow populations never demonstrated used amplified fragment length polymorphism aflp markers study gene flow greenish warblers phylloscopus trochiloides genetic markers show distinct differences two reproductively isolated forms gradual change ring connecting forms findings provide strongest evidence yet speciation force distance face ongoing gene flow
