variance ecological consumer-resource interactions 
food-web models use effect size trophic interactions predict consumer-resource dynamics1- models anticipate strong effects consumers increase spatial temporal variability abundance species whereas weak effects dampen fluctuations4- empirical evidence indicates opposite patterns may occur natural assemblages7 show spatial variance distribution resource populations sensitive changes variance trophic interaction addition mean effect consumers relative causes spatial variability simulations indicate strong weak direct effects consumers can promote spatial variability abundance resources trophic interactions large mean effect size can reduce variation predictions model agree results repeated field experiments consistent data published consumer-resource interactions proving robust across widely varying environmental conditions species life histories thus food-web models embody variance trophic interactions may increased capacity explain wide range effects consumers documented empirical studies
