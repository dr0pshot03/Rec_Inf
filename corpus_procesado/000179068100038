neurons medial prefrontal cortex signal memory fear extinction 
conditioned fear responses tone previously paired shock diminish tone repeatedly presented without shock process known extinction since pavlov1 hypothesized extinction erase conditioning forms new memory destruction ventral medial prefrontal cortex consists infralimbic prelimbic cortices blocks recall fear extinction23 indicating medial prefrontal cortex might store long-term extinction memory show infralimbic neurons recorded fear conditioning extinction fire tone rats recalling extinction following day rats froze least showed greatest increase infralimbic tone responses also show conditioned tones paired brief electrical stimulation infralimbic cortex elicit low freezing rats extinguished thus stimulation resembling extinction-induced infralimbic tone responses able simulate extinction memory suggest consolidation extinction learning potentiates infralimbic activity inhibits fear subsequent encounters fear stimuli
