glacial-interglacial indian summer monsoon dynamics 
modern indian summer monsoon ism characterized exceptionally strong interhemispheric transport indicating importance northern southern hemisphere processes driving monsoon variability present high-resolution continental record southwestern china demonstrates importance interhemispheric forcing driving ism variability glacial-interglacial time scale well interglacial ism maxima dominated enhanced indian low associated global ice volume minima contrast glacial ism reaches minimum actually begins increase global ice volume reaches maximum attribute early strengthening increased cross-equatorial pressure gradient derived southern hemisphere high-latitude cooling mechanism explains much nonorbital scale variance pleistocene ism record
