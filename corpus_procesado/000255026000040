fishing magnifies fluctuations fish abundance 
now clear fished populations can fluctuate unharvested stocks however clear distinguish among three major competing mechanisms phenomenon using year california cooperative oceanic fisheries investigations calcofi larval fish record first variable fishing pressure directly increases variability exploited populations second commercial fishing can decrease average body size age stock causing truncated population track environmental fluctuations directly third age truncated juvenescent populations increasingly unstable population dynamics changing demographic parameters intrinsic growth rates find evidence first hypothesis limited evidence second strong evidence third therefore california current fisheries increased temporal variability population arise variable exploitation reflect direct environmental tracking fundamentally arises increased instability dynamics finding implications resource management empirical example selective harvesting can alter basic dynamics exploited populations lead unstable booms busts can precede systematic declines stock levels
