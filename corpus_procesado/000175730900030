prokineticin transmits behavioural circadian rhythm suprachiasmatic nucleus 
suprachiasmatic nucleus scn controls circadian rhythm physiological behavioural processes mammals show prokineticin pk2 cysteine-rich secreted protein functions output molecule scn circadian clock pk2 messenger rna rhythmically expressed scn phase pk2 rhythm responsive light entrainment molecular genetic studies revealed pk2 gene controlled circadian clock clock-controlled receptor pk2 pkr2 abundantly expressed major target nuclei scn output pathway inhibition nocturnal locomotor activity rats intracerebroventricular delivery recombinant pk2 subjective night endogenous pk2 mrna level low supports hypothesis pk2 output molecule transmits behavioural circadian rhythm high expression pkr2 mrna within scn positive feedback pk2 transcription activation pkr2 suggest pk2 may also function locally within scn synchronize output
