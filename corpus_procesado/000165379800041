defect-induced phase separation dipolar fluids
defect-induced critical phase separation dipolar fluids predicted replaces usual liquid-gas transition driven isotropic aggregation particles absent dipolar fluids due strong chaining coexisting phases dilute gas chain ends coexists high-density liquid chain branching points model provides unified explanation branched structures unusually low critical temperature density consequent two-phase coexistence islands recently observed experiment simulation
