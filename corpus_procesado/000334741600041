nectar secretion requires sucrose phosphate synthases sugar transporter sweet9 
angiosperms developed floral nectaries reward pollinating insects1 although nectar function composition characterized mechanism nectar secretion remained unclear2 identify sweet9 nectary-specific sugar transporter three eudicot species: arabidopsis thaliana brassica rapa extrastaminal nectaries nicotiana attenuata gynoecial nectaries show sweet9 essential nectar production can function efflux transporter also show sucrose phosphate synthase genes encoding key enzymes sucrose biosynthesis highly expressed nectaries expression also essential nectar secretion together data consistent model sucrose synthesized nectary parenchyma subsequently secreted extracellular space via sweet9 sucrose hydrolysed apoplasmic invertase produce mixture sucrose glucose fructose recruitment sweet9 sucrose export may key innovation coincided evolution core eudicots contributed evolution nectar secretion reward pollinators
