observation single colloidal platinum nanocrystal growth trajectories 
understanding colloidal nanocrystal growth mechanisms essential syntheses nanocrystals desired physical properties classical model growth monodisperse nanocrystals assumes discrete nucleation stage followed growth via monomer attachment overlooked particle-particle interactions recent studies suggested interactions particles play important role using situ transmission electron microscopy show platinum nanocrystals can grow either monomer attachment solution particle coalescence combination two processes initially broad size distribution can spontaneously narrow nearly monodisperse distribution suggest colloidal nanocrystals take different pathways growth based size morphology-dependent internal energies
