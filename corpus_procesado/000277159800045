d-amino acids trigger biofilm disassembly 
bacteria form communities known biofilms disassemble time studies outlined found biofilm disassembly bacillus subtilis produced factor prevented biofilm formation break existing biofilms factor shown mixture d-leucine d-methionine d-tyrosine d-tryptophan act nanomolar concentrations d-amino acid treatment caused release amyloid fibers linked cells biofilm together mutants able form biofilms presence d-amino acids contained alterations protein yqxm required formation anchoring fibers cell d-amino acids also prevented biofilm formation staphylococcus aureus pseudomonas aeruginosa d-amino acids produced many bacteria thus may widespread signal biofilm disassembly
