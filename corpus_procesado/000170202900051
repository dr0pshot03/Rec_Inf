rb targets histone h3 methylation hp1 promoters 
eukaryotic cells histone methylase suv39h1 methyl-lysine binding protein hp1 functionally interact repress transcription heterochromatic sites lysine histone h3 methylated suv39h1 ref creating binding site chromo domain hp1 refs show suv39h1 hp1 involved repressive functions retinoblastoma rb protein rb associates suv39h1 hp1 vivo means pocket domain suv39h1 cooperates rb repress cyclin e promoter fibroblasts disrupted suv39 activity cyclin e cyclin a2 genes specifically elevated chromatin immunoprecipitations show rb necessary direct methylation histone h3 necessary binding hp1 cyclin e promoter results indicate suv39h1-hp1 complex involved heterochromatic silencing also role repression euchromatic genes rb perhaps co-repressor proteins
