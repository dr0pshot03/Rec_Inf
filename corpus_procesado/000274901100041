cortical plasticity induced inhibitory neuron transplantation
critical periods times pronounced brain plasticity critical period postnatal development visual cortex occlusion one eye triggers rapid reorganization neuronal responses process known ocular dominance plasticity shown transplantation inhibitory neurons induces ocular dominance plasticity critical period transplanted inhibitory neurons receive excitatory synapses make inhibitory synapses onto host cortical neurons promote plasticity reach cellular age equivalent endogenous inhibitory neurons normal critical period findings suggest ocular dominance plasticity regulated execution maturational program intrinsic inhibitory neurons inducing plasticity inhibitory neuron transplantation may facilitate brain repair
