near-infrared flares accreting gas around supermassive black hole galactic centre 
recent measurements stellar orbits- provide compelling evidence compact radio source sagittarius a* refs galactic centre -million-solar-mass black hole sgr a* remarkably faint wavebands radio region however challenges current theories matter accretion radiation surrounding black holes black holes rotation rate known therefore neither structure space-time around report high-resolution infrared observations sgr a* reveal quiescent emission several flares infrared emission originates within milliarcseconds black hole traces energetic electrons moderately hot gas within innermost accretion region two flares exhibit minute quasi-periodic variability periodicity arises relativistic modulation orbiting gas emission must come just outside event horizon black hole must rotating half maximum possible rate
