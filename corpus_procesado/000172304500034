long-distance quantum communication atomic ensembles linear optics 
quantum communication holds promise absolutely secure transmission secret messages faithful transfer unknown quantum states photonic channels appear attractive physical implementation quantum communication however owing losses decoherence channel communication fidelity decreases exponentially channel length describe scheme allows implementation robust quantum communication long lossy channels scheme involves laser manipulation atomic ensembles beam splitters single-photon detectors moderate efficiencies therefore compatible current experimental technology show communication efficiency scales polynomially channel length hence scheme operable long distances
