histone lysine demethylase jarid1a activates clock-bmal1 influences circadian clock 
animals circadian oscillators based transcription-translation circuit revolves around transcription factors clock bmal1 found jumonjic jmjc arid domain-containing histone lysine demethylase 1a jarid1a formed complex clock-bmal1 recruited per2 promoter jarid1a increased histone acetylation inhibiting histone deacetylase function enhanced transcription clock-bmal1 demethylase-independent manner depletion jarid1a mammalian cells reduced per promoter histone acetylation dampened expression canonical circadian genes shortened period circadian rhythms drosophila lines reduced expression jarid1a homolog lid lowered per expression similarly altered circadian rhythms jarid1a thus nonredundant role circadian oscillator function
