understanding dynamics correlated many-body quantum systems challenge modern physics owing simplicity theirhamiltonians bosons fermions served model systems strongly interacting quantum fluids substantial efforts devoted understanding important milestone direct observation collective phonon-roton mode liquid neutron scattering verifying landaus prediction fruitful concept elementary excitations fermi system collective density fluctuations known zero-sound he- plasmons charged systems incoherent particle-hole excitations observed small wavevectors energies types excitation described landaus theory fermi liquids higher wavevectors collectivemode enters particle-hole band strongly damped dynamics fermi liquids high wavevectors thus believed essentially incoherent report inelastic neutron scattering measurements monolayer liquid he- observing roton-like excitation find collective density mode reappears well defined excitation atmomentum transfers larger twice fermi momentum thus observe unexpected collective behaviour fermi many-body system regime beyond scope landaus theory satisfactory interpretation measured spectra obtained using dynamic many-body theory
