rabbit genome analysis reveals polygenic basis phenotypic change domestication 
genetic changes underlying initial steps animal domestication still poorly understood generated high-quality reference genome rabbit compared resequencing data populations wild domestic rabbits identified selective sweeps specific domestic rabbits relatively small number fixed nearly fixed single-nucleotide polymorphisms snps derived alleles snps marked allele frequency differences wild domestic rabbits enriched conserved noncoding sites enrichment analyses suggest genes affecting brain neuronal development often targeted domestication propose truly complex genetic background tame behavior rabbits domestic animals evolved shifts allele frequencies many loci rather critical changes domestication loci
