charge self-regulation upon changing oxidation state transition metals insulators
transition metal atoms embedded ionic semiconducting crystal can exist various oxidation states distinct signatures x ray photoemission spectroscopy ionic radii vary oxidation state atom oxidation states often tacitly associated physical ionization transition metal atoms literal transfer charge atoms physical models founded charge transfer paradigm- first principles quantum mechanical calculations show negligible changes local transition-metal charge- oxidation state altered explain peculiar tendency transition metal atoms maintain constant local charge external perturbations terms inherent homeostasis like negative feedback show signatures oxidation states multivalence x ray photoemission core level shifts ionic radii variations local magnetization often interpreted literal charge transfer- instead consequence negative feedback charge regulation
