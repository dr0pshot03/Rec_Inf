nicotinamide pnc1 govern lifespan extension calorie restriction saccharomyces cerevisiae 
calorie restriction extends lifespan broad range organisms yeasts mammals numerous hypotheses proposed explain phenomenon including decreased oxidative damage altered energy metabolism saccharomyces cerevisiae lifespan extension calorie restriction requires nad+-dependent histone deacetylase sir2 ref recently shown sir2 closest human homologue sirt1 p53 deacetylase strongly inhibited vitamin b3 precursor nicotinamide2 show increased expression pnc1 pyrazinamidase/nicotinamidase encodes enzyme deaminates nicotinamide necessary sufficient lifespan extension calorie restriction low-intensity stress also identify pnc1 longevity gene responsive stimuli extend lifespan provide evidence nicotinamide depletion sufficient activate sir2 mechanism pnc1 regulates longevity conclude yeast lifespan extension calorie restriction consequence active cellular response low-intensity stress speculate nicotinamide might regulate critical cellular processes higher organisms
