flexible control mutual inhibition: neural model two-interval discrimination 
networks adapt environmental demands switching distinct dynamical behaviors activity frontal-lobe neurons two-interval discrimination tasks example adaptable dynamics subjects first perceive stimulus hold working memory finally make decision comparing second stimulus present simple mutual-inhibition network model captures three task phases within single framework model integrates working memory decision making dynamical properties easily controlled without changing connectivity mutual inhibition nonlinear units useful design motif networks must display multiple behaviors
