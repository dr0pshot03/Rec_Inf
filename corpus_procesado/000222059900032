deterministic quantum teleportation atomic qubits 
quantum teleportation provides means transport quantum information efficiently one location another without physical transfer associated quantum-information carrier achieved using non-local correlations previously distributed entangled quantum bits qubits teleportation expected play integral role quantum communication quantum computation previous experimental demonstrations implemented optical systems used discrete continuous variables- liquid-state nuclear magnetic resonance report unconditional teleportation massive particle qubits using atomic be-+ ions confined segmented ion trap aids individual qubit addressing achieve average fidelity per cent exceeds fidelity protocol use entanglement demonstration also important incorporates techniques necessary scalable quantum information processing ion-trap system
