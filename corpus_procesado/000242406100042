rapid chemically induced changes ptdlns45p- gate kcnq ion channels 
resolve controversy messengers regulating kcnq ion channels phospholipase c mediated suppression current designed translocatable enzymes quickly alter phosphoinositide composition plasma membrane application chemical cue kcnq current falls rapidly zero phosphatidylinositol -bisphosphate [ptdins45 p- pi45 p-] depleted without changing ca2+ diacylglycerol inositol -trisphosphate current rises % pi45 p- overproduced change phosphatidylinositol -trisphosphate raised hence depletion pi45 p- suffices suppress current fully second messengers needed approach ideally suited study biological signaling networks involving membrane phosphoinositides
