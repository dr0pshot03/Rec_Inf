rapid chemically induced changes ptdlnsp gate kcnq ion channels 
resolve controversy messengers regulating kcnq ion channels phospholipase c mediated suppression current designed translocatable enzymes quickly alter phosphoinositide composition plasma membrane application chemical cue kcnq current falls rapidly zero phosphatidylinositol -bisphosphate [ptdins p pi p-] depleted without changing ca2+ diacylglycerol inositol -trisphosphate current rises % pi p overproduced change phosphatidylinositol -trisphosphate raised hence depletion pi p suffices suppress current fully second messengers needed approach ideally suited study biological signaling networks involving membrane phosphoinositides
