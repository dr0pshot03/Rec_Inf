k13-propeller mutations confer artemisinin resistance plasmodium falciparum clinical isolates 
emergence artemisinin resistance southeast asia imperils efforts reduce global malaria burden genetically modified plasmodium falciparum k13 locus using zinc-finger nucleases measured ring-stage survival rates drug exposure vitro rates correlate parasite clearance half-lives artemisinin-treated patients isolates cambodia resistance first emerged survival rates decreased % % removal k13 mutations conversely survival rates wild-type parasites increased < % % insertion k13 mutations mutations conferred elevated resistance recent cambodian isolates compared reference lines suggesting contemporary contribution additional genetic factors data provide conclusive rationale worldwide k13-propeller sequencing identify eliminate artemisinin-resistant parasites
