high-strength welds metallocene polypropylene/polyethylene laminates
spectacular advances organometallic chemistry past two decades resulted single-site catalysts revolutionizing production polyethylene pe isotactic polypropylene ipp report describes unanticipated benefit metallocene-catalyzed semicrystalline polyolefins namely welded joint strengths pe/ipp laminates can exceed cohesive strength constituents propose interfacial polymer entanglements established molten state subsequently anchored chain-folded lamellae upon crystallization responsible intrinsic property poor adhesion exhibited traditional ziegler-natta-catalyzed polyolefins shown derive accumulation amorphous polymer by-product polymerization reactions interface results facilitate fabrication improve properties composites based materials dominate plastics industry
