massively parallel manipulation single cells microparticles using optical images 
ability manipulate biological cells micrometre-scale particles plays important role many biological colloidal science applications however conventional manipulation techniques including optical tweezers- electrokinetic forces electrophoresis dielectrophoresis travelling-wave dielectrophoresis magnetic tweezers acoustic traps hydrodynamic flows- achieve high resolution high throughput time optical tweezers offer high resolution trapping single particles limited manipulation area owing tight focusing requirements hand electrokinetic forces mechanisms provide high throughput lack flexibility spatial resolution necessary controlling individual cells present optical image-driven dielectrophoresis technique permits high-resolution patterning electric fields photoconductive surface manipulating single particles requires times less optical intensity optical tweezers using incoherent light source light-emitting diode halogen lamp digital micromirror spatial light modulator demonstrated parallel manipulation particle traps x mm area direct optical imaging control multiple manipulation functions combined achieve complex multi-step manipulation protocols
