efficient hot-electron transfer plasmon-induced interfacial charge-transfer transition 
plasmon-induced hot-electron transfer metal nanostructures potential new paradigm solar energy conversion; however reported efficiencies devices based concept often low loss hot electrons via ultrafast electron-electron scattering propose pathway called plasmon-induced interfacial charge-transfer transition pictt enables decay plasmon directly exciting electron metal strongly coupled acceptor demonstrated concept cadmium selenide nanorods gold tips gold plasmon strongly damped cadmium selenide interfacial electron transfer quantum efficiency pictt process high >% independent excitation photon energy similar -electron volt range dependent excitation polarization
