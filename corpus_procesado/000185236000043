motion-induced spatial conflict 
borders defined small changes brightness luminance contrast differences colour chromatic contrast appear move slowly defined strong luminance contrast- spatial coding influenced motion- placed close proximity different types moving border might appear drift apart using configuration show observers instead report clear illusory spatial jitter low-luminance-contrast boundary visible interaction motion spatial-position coding occurred characteristic rate similar to22 hz although stimulus motion continuous invariant jitter rate vary speed movement jitter due small involuntary movements eyes occurred specific point within stimulus low-luminance-contrast boundary findings show human visual system contains neural mechanism periodically resolves spatial conflict created adjacent moving borders physical different perceptual speeds
