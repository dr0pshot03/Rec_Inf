learning medial prefrontal cortex mpfc gradually comes modulate expression memories initially depended hippocampus show consolidation period neural firing mpfc becomes selective acquired memories acquisition memory associations neuron populations mpfc rats developed sustained activity interval two paired stimuli reduced activity corresponding interval two unpaired stimuli new patterns developed period several weeks learning without continued conditioning trials thus agreement central tenet consolidation theory acquired associations initiate subsequent gradual processes result lasting changes mpfcs code without continued training
