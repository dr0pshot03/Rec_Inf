inner centromere-shugoshin network prevents chromosomal instability 
chromosomal instability cin major trait cancer cells potent driver tumor progression however molecular mechanisms underlying cin still remain elusive found number cin+ cell lines impairments integrity conserved inner centromere-shugoshin ics network coordinates sister chromatid cohesion kinetochore-microtubule attachment defects caused mostly loss histone h3 lysine trimethylation centromeres sometimes reduction chromatin-associated cohesin; pathways separately sustain centromeric shugoshin stability artificial restoration ics network suppresses chromosome segregation errors wide range cin+ cells including rb brca1-deficient cells thus dysfunction ics network might key mechanism underlying cin human tumorigenesis
