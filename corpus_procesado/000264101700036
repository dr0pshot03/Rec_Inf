nonporous organic solids capable dynamically resolving mixtures diiodoperfluoroalkanes 
halogen bonding increasingly facilitated assembly diverse host-guest solids show well-known class organic salts bistrimethylammonium alkane diiodides can reversibly encapsulate alphaomega-diiodoperfluoroalkanes dipfas intermolecular interactions hosts i- anions guests terminal iodine substituents process highly selective fluorocarbon forms i-center dot center dot center dot icfmi center dot center dot center dot i- superanion matched length chosen dication dipfas carbons length common industrial intermediates can thereby isolated mixtures means crystallization solution upon addition dissolved size-matched ionic salt solid-state salts can also selectively capture dipfas vapor phase yielding product formed solution despite lack porosity starting lattice structure heating liberates dipfas regenerates original salt lattice highlighting practical potential system separation applications
