lymphatic metastasis absence functional intratumor lymphatics 
lymphatic metastasis contributes mortality solid tumors whether metastasizing cancer cells reach lymph nodes via intratumor lymphatic vessels unknown examine functional lymphatics associated mouse tumors expressing normal elevated levels vascular endothelial growth factor-c vegf-c molecule stimulates lymphangiogenesis although vegf-c overexpression increased lymphatic surface area tumor margin lymphatic metastasis tumors contained functional lymphatics assessed four independent functional assays immunohistochemical staining findings suggest functional lymphatics tumor margin alone sufficient lymphatic metastasis targeted therapeutically
