elevation changes antarctica mainly determined accumulation variability 
antarctic ice sheet elevation changes used estimate changes mass interior regions caused variations depth firn layer quantified effects temperature accumulation variability firn layer thickness simulating antarctic firn depth variability antarctica magnitudes firn depth changes comparable observed ice sheet elevation changes current satellite observational period similar years short neglect fluctuations firn depth computing recent ice sheet mass changes amount surface lowering amundsen sea embayment revealed satellite radar altimetry increased including firn depth fluctuations large area east antarctic ice sheet slowly grew result increased accumulation
