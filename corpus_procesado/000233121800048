fast readout object identity macaque inferior temporal cortex 
understanding brain computations leading object recognition requires quantitative characterization information represented inferior temporal cortex used biologically plausible classifier-based readout technique investigate neural coding selectivity invariance population level activity small neuronal populations similar randomly selected cells short time intervals small milliseconds contained unexpectedly accurate robust information object identity category information generalized range object positions scales even novel objects coarse information position scale also read population
