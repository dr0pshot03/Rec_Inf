polymer gate dielectric surface viscoelasticity modulates pentacene transistor performance 
nanoscopically confined polymer films known exhibit substantially depressed glass transition temperatures t-gs compared corresponding bulk materials report pentacene thin films grown polymer gate dielectrics temperatures well bulk t-gs exhibit distinctive abrupt morphological microstructural transitions thin-film transistor tft performance discontinuities well-defined growth temperatures changes reflect higher chain mobility dielectric rubbery state independent dielectric film thickness optimization organic tft performance must recognize fundamental buried interface viscoelasticity effect detectable current-voltage response
