large sulfur bacteria formation phosphorite 
phosphorite deposits marine sediments long-term sink essential nutrient phosphorus show apatite abundance sediments namibian shelf correlates abundance activity giant sulfur bacterium thiomargarita namibiensis suggests sulfur bacteria drive phosphogenesis sediments populated thiomargarita showed sharp peaks pore water phosphate less equal to300 micromolar massive phosphorite accumulations greater equal to50 grams phosphorus per kilogram laboratory experiments revealed anoxic conditions thiomargarita released enough phosphate account precipitation hydroxyapatite observed environment
