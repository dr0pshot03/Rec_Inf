genome-wide rnai screen identifies letm1 mitochondrial ca2+/h+ antiporter 
mitochondria integral components cellular calcium ca2+ signaling calcium stimulates mitochondrial adenosine -triphosphate production can also initiate apoptosis turn cytoplasmic ca2+ concentrations regulated mitochondria although several transporter ion-channel mechanisms measured mitochondria molecules govern ca2+ movement across inner mitochondrial membrane unknown searched genes regulate mitochondrial ca2+ h+ concentrations using genome-wide drosophila rna interference rnai screen mammalian homolog one drosophila gene identified screen letm1 found specifically mediate coupled ca2+/h+ exchange rnai knockdown overexpression liposome reconstitution purified letm1 protein demonstrate letm1 mitochondrial ca2+/h+ antiporter
