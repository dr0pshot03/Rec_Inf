all-optical switching rubidium vapor 
report all-optical switch operates low light levels consists laser beams counterpropagating warm rubidium vapor induce off-axis optical pattern switching laser beam causes pattern rotate even power switching beam much lower power pattern observed switching energy density low suggesting switch might operate single-photon level system optimization approach opens possibility realizing single-photon switch quantum information networks improving transparent optical telecommunication networks
