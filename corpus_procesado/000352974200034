multistep continuous-flow synthesis r s rolipram using heterogeneous catalysts 
chemical manufacturing conducted using either batch systems continuous-flow systems flow systems several advantages batch systems particularly terms productivity heat mixing efficiency safety reproducibility however half century pharmaceutical manufacturing used batch systems synthesis complex molecules drugs difficult achieve continuous-flow systems describe continuous-flow synthesis drugs using columns packed heterogeneous catalysts commercially available starting materials successively passed four columns containing achiral chiral heterogeneous catalysts produce r-rolipram anti-inflammatory drug one family y-aminobutyric acid gaba derivatives addition simply replacing column packed chiral heterogeneous catalyst another column packed opposing enantiomer obtained antipole s-rolipram similarly also synthesized r-phenibut another drug belonging gaba family flow systems simple stable leaching metal catalysts results demonstrate multistep eight steps case chemical transformations drug synthesis can proceed smoothly flow conditions using heterogeneous catalysts without isolation intermediates without separation catalysts co-products by-products excess reagents anticipate syntheses will useful pharmaceutical manufacturing
