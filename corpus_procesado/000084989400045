complementary neural mechanisms tracking items human working memory 
recognition specific visual target among equally familiar distracters requires neural mechanisms tracking items working memory event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging revealed evidence two mechanisms: enhanced neural responses primarily frontal cortex associated target maintained across repetitions target ii reduced responses primarily extrastriate visual cortex associated stimulus repetition regardless whether stimulus target distracter complementary neural mechanisms track status familiar items working memory allowing efficient recognition currently relevant object rejection irrelevant distracters
