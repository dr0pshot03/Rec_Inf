spectroscopic characterization mineralogy diversity across vesta 
mineralogy vesta based data obtained dawn spacecrafts visible infrared spectrometer consistent howardite-eucrite-diogenite meteorites considerable regional local variations across asteroid: spectrally distinct regions include south-polar rheasilvia basin displays higher diogenitic component equatorial regions show higher eucritic component lithologic distribution indicates deeper diogenitic crust exposed excavation impact formed rheasilvia upper eucritic crust evidence mineralogical stratigraphic layering observed crater walls ejecta broadly consistent magma-ocean models spectral variability highlights local variations suggests crust can complex assemblage eucritic basalts pyroxene cumulates overall vesta mineralogy indicates complex magmatic evolution led differentiated crust mantle
