nondestructive detection optical photon 
optical detectors date annihilate photons upon detection thus excluding repeated measurements demonstrate robust photon detection scheme rely absorption instead incoming photon reflected optical resonator containing single atom prepared superposition two states reflection toggles superposition phase measured trace photon characterizing device faint laser pulses single-photon detection efficiency % survival probability % achieved efficiency can increased observing photon repeatedly large single-photon nonlinearity experiment enable development photonic quantum gates preparation exotic quantum states light
