role gtp-binding protein activity fast central synaptic transmission
guanosine -triphosphate gtp-binding proteins g proteins involved exocytosis endocytosis recycling vesicles yeast mammalian secretory cells however little known contribution fast synaptic transmission loaded guanine nucleotide analogs directly giant nerve terminal rat brainstem slices inhibition g-protein activity effect basal synaptic transmission augmented synaptic depression significantly slowed recovery depression nonhydrolyzable gtp analog blocked recovery transmission activity-dependent depression neither effect accompanied change presynaptic calcium currents thus g proteins contribute fast synaptic transmission refitting synaptic vesicles depleted massive exocytosis
