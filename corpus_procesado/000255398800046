hierarchical structure prediction missing links networks 
networks recent years emerged invaluable tool describing quantifying complex systems many branches science1- recent studies suggest networks often exhibit hierarchical organization vertices divide groups subdivide groups groups forth multiple scales many cases groups found correspond known functional units ecological niches food webs modules biochemical networks protein interaction networks metabolic networks genetic regulatory networks communities social networks4- present general technique inferring hierarchical structure network data show existence hierarchy can simultaneously explain quantitatively reproduce many commonly observed topological properties networks right skewed degree distributions high clustering coefficients short path lengths show knowledge hierarchical structure can used predict missing connections partly known networks high accuracy general network structures competing techniques8 taken together results suggest hierarchy central organizing principle complex networks capable offering insight many network phenomena
