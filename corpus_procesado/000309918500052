initiation transcription-coupled repair characterized single-molecule resolution
transcription-coupled dna repair uses components transcription machinery identify dna lesions initiate repair repair pathways complex mechanistic features remain poorly understood bacterial transcription-coupled repair initiated rna polymerase stalled dna lesion removed mfd atp-dependent dna translocase- use single-molecule dna nanomanipulation observe dynamic interactions escherichia coli mfd rna polymerase elongation complexes stalled cyclopyrimidine dimer nucleotide starvation show mfd acts catalysing two irreversible atp-dependent transitions different structural kinetic mechanistic features mfd remains bound dna long-lived complex act marker sites dna damage directing assembly subsequent dna repair factors results provide framework considering kinetics transcription-coupled repair vivo open way reconstruction complete dna repair pathways single-molecule resolution
