new specimen archaeopteryx provides insights evolution pennaceous feathers 
discoveries bird-like theropod dinosaurs basal avialans recent decades helped put iconic urvogel archaeopteryx context- yielded important new data origin early evolution feathers however biological context pennaceous feathers evolved still debated describe new specimen archaeopteryx extensive feather preservation wings tail also body legs new specimen shows entire body covered pennaceous feathers hindlimbs long symmetrical feathers along tibiotarsus short feathers tarsometatarsus furthermore wing plumage demonstrates several recent interpretations problematic analysis phylogenetic distribution pennaceous feathers tail hindlimb arms advanced maniraptorans basal avialans strongly indicates structures evolved functional context flight probably relation display suggested previous studies- pennaceous feathers thus represented exaptation later several lineages following different patterns recruited aerodynamic functions indicates origin flight avialans complex previously thought might involved several convergent achievements aerial abilities
