decoding human cytomegalovirus 
human cytomegalovirus hcmv genome sequenced years ago however like complex viruses understanding protein coding potential far complete used ribosome profiling transcript analysis experimentally define hcmv translation products follow temporal expression identified hundreds previously unidentified open reading frames confirmed fraction means mass spectrometry found regulated use alternative transcript start sites plays broad role enabling tight temporal control hcmv protein expression allowing multiple distinct polypeptides generated single genomic locus results reveal unanticipated complexity hcmv coding capacity illustrate role regulated changes transcript start sites generating complexity
