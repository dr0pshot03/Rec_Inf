larger pool ozone-forming carbon compounds urban atmospheres 
volatile organic compounds play central role processes generate urban photochemical smog tropospheric ozone successful accurate prediction pollution episodes identification dominant reactive species within volatile organic carbon pool needed present lack resolution inherent single-column chromatographic analysis limits detailed chemical characterization complex urban atmosphere present improved method peak deconvolution double-column orthogonal gas chromatography enabled us isolate classify chemical species volatile organic compounds urban air including multi-substituted monoaromatic volatile oxygenated hydrocarbons suggest previous assessments reactive carbon species may therefore underestimated contribution made volatile organic compounds urban pollution particularly compounds six carbon atoms incorporating species predictive models greatly improve understanding photochemical ozone yields formation harmful secondary organic aerosols
