sensing voltage across lipid membranes 
detection electrical potentials across lipid bilayers specialized membrane proteins required many fundamental cellular processes generation propagation nerve impulses membrane proteins possess modular voltage sensing domains notable example s1 s4 domains voltage activated ion channels ground breaking structural studies domains explain voltage sensors designed reveal important interactions surrounding lipid membrane although structures needed understand conformational changes occur voltage sensing available data help frame several key concepts fundamental mechanism voltage sensing
