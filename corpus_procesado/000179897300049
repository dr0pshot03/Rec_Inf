long-term vivo imaging experience-dependent synaptic plasticity adult cortex
new synapses form adult cortex support experience-dependent plasticity address question repeatedly imaged individual pyramidal neurons mouse barrel cortex periods weeks found although dendritic structure stable spines appear disappear spine lifetimes vary greatly: stable spines % population persist least month whereas remainder present days less serial-section electron microscopy imaged dendritic segments revealed retrospectively spine sprouting retraction associated synapse formation elimination experience-dependent plasticity cortical receptive fields accompanied increased synapse turnover measurements suggest sensory experience drives formation elimination synapses changes might underlie adaptive remodelling neural circuits
