massive binary black-hole system oj test general relativity
tests einsteins general theory relativity mostly carried weak gravitational fields space time curvature effects first order deviations newtons theory- binary pulsars provide means probing strong gravitational field around neutron star strong field effects may best tested systems containing black holes report test close binary system two candidate black holes quasar oj quasar shows quasi periodic optical outbursts year intervals two outburst peaks per interval latest outburst occurred september within day time predicted binary black hole model general relativity observations confirm binary nature system also provide evidence loss orbital energy agreement within per cent emission gravitational waves system absence gravitational wave emission outburst happened days later
