dirac cone underlies many unique electronic properties graphene topological insulators band structure-two conical bands touching single point-has also realized photons waveguide arrays atoms optical lattices accidental degeneracy deformation dirac cone often reveals intriguing properties example quantum hall effect constant magnetic field breaks dirac cone isolated landau levels seemingly unrelated phenomenon exceptional point also known parity-time symmetry breaking point- two resonances coincide positions widths exceptional points lead counter-intuitive phenomena loss-induced transparency unidirectional transmission reflection lasers reversed pump dependence single-mode operation dirac cones exceptional points connected: theoretically suggested certain non-hermitian perturbations can deform dirac cone spawn ring exceptional points- experimentally demonstrate exceptional ring photonic crystal slab angle-resolved reflection measurements photonic crystal slab reveal peaks reflectivity follow conical band structure dirac cone resulting accidental degeneracy whereas complex eigenvalues system deformed two-dimensional flat band enclosed exceptional ring deformation arises dissimilar radiation rates dipole quadrupole resonances play role analogous loss gain parity-time symmetric systems results indicate radiation existing open system can fundamentally alter physical properties ways previously expected presence material loss gain
