frequency gamma oscillations routes flow information hippocampus 
gamma oscillations thought transiently link distributed cell assemblies processing related information function probably important network processes perception- attentional selection memory binding mechanism requires spatially distributed cells fire together millisecond range precision however clear coordinated timing achieved given frequency gamma oscillations varies substantially across space time similar almost hz- show gamma oscillations ca1 area hippocampus split distinct fast slow frequency components differentially couple ca1 inputs medial entorhinal cortex area provides information animals current position- ca3 hippocampal subfield essential storage information fast gamma oscillations ca1 synchronized fast gamma medial entorhinal cortex slow gamma oscillations ca1 coherent slow gamma ca3 significant proportions cells medial entorhinal cortex ca3 phase-locked fast slow ca1 gamma waves respectively two types gamma occurred different phases ca1 theta rhythm mostly different theta cycles results point routeing information possible function gamma frequency variations brain provide mechanism temporal segregation potentially interfering information different sources
