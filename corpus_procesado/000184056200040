chloride methylation plant pectin: efficient environmentally significant process
atmospheric chloromethane ch3cl plays important role stratospheric ozone destruction many uncertainties exist regarding strengths sources sinks particularly regarding processes generating naturally occurring gas evidence presented ch3cl produced many terrestrial environments common mechanism abiotic conversion chloride ch3cl occurs readily plant material widespread plant component pectin acting methyl donor significant ch3cl emissions senescent dead leaves observed ambient temperatures emissions rose dramatically temperatures increased ubiquitous process acting terrestrial ecosystems biomass burning contribute bulk atmospheric ch3cl
