origin low rigidity earths inner core 
earths solid-iron inner core low rigidity manifests anomalously low velocities shear waves compared shear wave velocities measured iron alloys normally estimating elastic properties polycrystal one calculates average different orientations single crystal approach take account grain boundaries defects likely abundant high temperatures relevant inner core conditions using molecular dynamics simulations show defects considered calculated shear modulus shear wave velocity decrease dramatically compared estimates obtained averaged single-crystal values thus low shear wave velocity inner core explained
