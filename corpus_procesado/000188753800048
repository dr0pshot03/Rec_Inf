global mapping yeast genetic interaction network 
genetic interaction network containing similar to1000 genes similar to4000 interactions mapped crossing mutations different query genes set similar to4700 viable gene yeast deletion mutants scoring double mutant progeny fitness defects network connectivity predictive function interactions often occurred among functionally related genes similar patterns interactions tended identify components pathway genetic network exhibited dense local neighborhoods therefore position gene partially mapped network predictive genetic interactions digenic interactions common yeast similar networks may underlie complex genetics associated inherited phenotypes organisms
