drosophila melanogaster genetic reference panel 
major challenge biology understanding relationship molecular genetic variation variation quantitative traits including fitness relationship determines ability predict phenotypes genotypes understand evolutionary forces shape variation within species previous efforts dissect genotype-phenotype map based incomplete genotypic information describe drosophila melanogaster genetic reference panel dgrp community resource analysis population genomics quantitative traits dgrp consists fully sequenced inbred lines derived natural population population genomic analyses reveal reduced polymorphism centromeric autosomal regions x chromosome evidence positive negative selection rapid evolution x chromosome many variants novel genes low frequency associated quantitative traits explain large fraction phenotypic variance dgrp facilitates genotype-phenotype mapping using power drosophila genetics
