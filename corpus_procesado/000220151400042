induction protective iga intestinal dendritic cells carrying commensal bacteria 
enormous number commensal bacteria lower intestine vertebrates share abundant molecular patterns used innate immune recognition pathogenic bacteria show even though commensals rapidly killed macrophages intestinal dendritic cells dcs can retain small numbers live commensals several days allows dcs selectively induce iga helps protect mucosal penetration commensals commensal-loaded dcs restricted mucosal immune compartment mesenteric lymph nodes ensures immune responses commensal bacteria induced locally without potentially damaging systemic immune responses
