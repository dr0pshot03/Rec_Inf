npas2: analog clock operative mammalian forebrain 
neuronal pas domain protein npas2 transcription factor expressed primarily mammalian forebrain npas2 highly related primary amino acid sequence clock transcription factor expressed suprachiasmatic nucleus heterodimerizes bmal1 regulates circadian rhythm investigate biological role npas2 prepared neuroblastoma cell line capable conditional induction npas2:bmal1 heterodimer identified putative target genes representational difference analysis dna microarrays northern blotting coinduction npas2 bmal1 activated transcription endogenous per1 per2 cry1 genes encode negatively activating components circadian regulatory apparatus repressed transcription endogenous bmal1 gene analysis frontal cortex wild-type mice kept -hour light-dark cycle revealed per1 per2 cry1 mrna levels elevated darkness reduced light whereas bmal1 mrna displayed opposite pattern situ hybridization assays mice kept constant darkness revealed per2 mrna abundance oscillate function circadian cycle npas2-deficient mice thus npas2 likely functions part molecular clock operative mammalian forebrain
