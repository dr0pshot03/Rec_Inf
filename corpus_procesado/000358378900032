dna rendering polyhedral meshes nanoscale 
suggested1 thirty years ago watson-crick base pairing might used rational design nanometre-scale structures nucleic acids since especially since introduction origami technique2 dna nanotechnology enabled increasingly complex structures3- although general approaches creating dna origami polygonal meshes design software available14161719- still important constraints arising dna geometry sense/antisense pairing necessitating manual adjustment design process present general method folding arbitrary polygonal digital meshes dna readily produces structures difficult realize using previous approaches design process highly automated using routeing algorithm based graph theory relaxation simulation traces scaffold strands target structures moreover unlike conventional origami designs built close-packed helices structures open conformation one helix per edge therefore stable ionic conditions usually used biological assays
