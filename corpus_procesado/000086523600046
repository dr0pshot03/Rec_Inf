manipulation atoms across surface room temperature
since realization tips scanning probe microscopes can interact atoms surfaces much interest possibility building modifying nanostructures molecules directly single atoms individual large molecules can positioned surfaces- atoms can transferred controllably sample probe tip complex structures- produced cryogenic temperatures sliding atoms across surface chosen sites problems manipulating atoms laterally higher temperatures-atoms sufficiently well bound surface stable higher temperatures require stronger tip interaction moved situation differs significantly idealized weakly interacting tips scanning tunnelling atomic force microscopes demonstrate precise positioning atoms copper surface possible room temperature triggering mechanism atomic motion unexpectedly depends tunnelling current density rather electric field proximity tip surface
