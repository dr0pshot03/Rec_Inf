kinetochore geometry defined cohesion within centromere
cell division microtubules capture chromosomes binding kinetochore assembled centromeric region chromosomes mitosis sister chromatids captured microtubules emanating spindle poles process called bipolar attachment whereas meiosis sisters attached microtubules originating one spindle pole called monopolar attachment determining chromosome orientation kinetochore geometry structure might important target regulation however molecular basis regulation remained elusive show link kinetochore orientation cohesion within centromere fission yeast schizosaccharomyces pombe strategies developed visualize concealed cohesion within centromere introduce artificial tethers can influence kinetochore geometry data imply cohesion core centromere induces mono-orientation kinetochores whereas cohesion peri-centromeric region promotes bi-orientation study may reveal general mechanism geometric regulation kinetochores collaborates previously defined tension-dependent reorientation machinery
