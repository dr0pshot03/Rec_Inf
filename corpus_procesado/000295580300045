map local adaptation arabidopsis thaliana
local adaptation critical species persistence face rapid environmental change genetic basis well understood growing model plant arabidopsis thaliana field experiments four sites across species native range identified candidate loci local adaptation genome-wide association study lifetime fitness geographically diverse accessions fitness-associated loci exhibited geographic climatic signatures local adaptation relative genomic controls high-fitness alleles generally distributed closer site increased fitness occupying specific distinct climate spaces independent loci different molecular functions contributed strongly fitness variation site independent local adaptation distinct genetic mechanisms may facilitate flexible evolutionary response changing environment across species range
