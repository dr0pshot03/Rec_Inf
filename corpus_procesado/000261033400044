control toxic marine dinoflagellate blooms serial parasitic killers 
marine dinoflagellates commonly responsible toxic red tides parasitized dinoflagellate species using culture independent environmental ribosomal rna sequences fluorescence markers identified host specific infections among several species parasitoid produces offspring leading extraordinarily rapid control hosts population consecutive years observation natural estuary dinoflagellates observed chronically infected given host species infected single genetically distinct parasite year year observations natural ecosystems suggest although bloom forming dinoflagellates may escape control grazing organisms eventually succumb parasite attack
