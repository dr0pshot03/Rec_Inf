high abrasion resistance sparse mineralization: copper biomineral worm jaws 
biominerals widely exploited harden stiffen tissues living organisms calcium- silicon- iron-based minerals common notable contrast jaws marine bloodworm glycera dibranchiata contain copper-based biomineral atacamite [cu-ohcl] polycrystalline fibers oriented outer contour jaw using nanoindentation show mineral structural role enhances hardness stiffness despite low degree mineralization bloodworm jaws exhibit extraordinary resistance abrasion significantly exceeding vertebrate dentin approaching tooth enamel
