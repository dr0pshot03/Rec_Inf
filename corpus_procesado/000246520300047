herpesvirus latency confers symbiotic protection bacterial infection 
humans become infected multiple herpesviruses childhood clearance acute infection herpesviruses enter dormant state known latency latency persists life host presumed parasitic leaves individual risk subsequent viral reactivation disease show herpesvirus latency also confers surprising benefit host mice latently infected either murine gammaherpesvirus murine cytomegalovirus genetically highly similar human pathogens epstein barr virus human cytomegalovirus respectively resistant infection bacterial pathogens listeria monocytogenes yersinia pestis latency-induced protection antigen specific involves prolonged production antiviral cytokine interferon-gamma systemic activation macrophages latency thereby upregulates basal activation state innate immunity subsequent infections speculate herpesvirus latency may also sculpt immune response self environmental antigens establishment polarized cytokine environment thus whereas immune evasion capabilities lifelong persistence herpesviruses commonly viewed solely pathogenic data suggest latency symbiotic relationship immune benefits host
