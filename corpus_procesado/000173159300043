stimulated platelets use serotonin enhance retention procoagulant proteins cell surface
activated platelets bind numerous adhesive procoagulant proteins receptor-mediated processes although little evidence suggest processes heterogeneous platelets previously found platelets co-stimulated collagen thrombin express functional alpha granule factor v subpopulation cells show cells referred coat-platelets bind additional alpha granule proteins including fibrinogen von willebrand factor thrombospondin fibronectin alpha -antiplasmin proteins transglutaminase substrates inhibitors transglutaminase prevent production coat-platelets synthetic transglutaminase substrate cp15 also binds coat-platelets analysis high performance liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry shows product formed relative molecular mass m-r equal cp15 plus serotonin abundant component platelet-dense granules m-r fibrinogen isolated coat-platelets contains covalently linked serotonin synthetic bovine serum albumin-serotonin binds selectively coat-platelets also inhibits retention procoagulant proteins coat-platelets data indicate coat-platelets use serotonin conjugation augment retention procoagulant proteins cell surface yet unidentified serotonin receptor
