control octopus arm extension peripheral motor program
goal-directed arm movements nervous system generates sequence motor commands bring arm toward target control octopus arm especially complex arm can moved direction virtually infinite number degrees freedom show arm extensions can evoked mechanically electrically arms whose connection brain severed extensions show kinematic features almost identical normal behavior suggesting basic motor program voluntary movement embedded within neural circuitry arm peripheral motor programs represent considerable simplification motor control highly redundant appendage
