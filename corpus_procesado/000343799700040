specificity vesicle traffic golgi encoded golgin coiled-coil proteins
golgi apparatus multicompartment central sorting station intersection secretory endocytic vesicular traffic mechanisms permit cargo-loaded transport vesicles different origins selectively access different golgi compartments incompletely understood developed rerouting capture assay investigate systematically vesicle-tethering activities widely conserved golgin coiled-coil proteins find subsets golgins distinct localizations golgi surface capture activities toward vesicles different origins findings demonstrate golgins act tethers vivo hence specificity find encoded tethering likely make major contribution organization membrane traffic golgi apparatus
