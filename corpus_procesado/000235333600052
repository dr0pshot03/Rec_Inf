bottom-up approach gene regulation 
ability construct synthetic gene networks enables experimental investigations deliberately simplified systems can compared qualitative quantitative models1- simple well-characterized modules can coupled together complex networks behaviour can predicted individual components may begin build understanding cellular regulatory processes bottom engineered promoter allow simultaneous repression activation gene expression escherichia coli studied behaviour synthetic gene networks increasingly complex conditions: unregulated repressed activated simultaneously repressed activated develop stochastic model quantitatively captures means distributions expression engineered promoter modular system show model can extended used accurately predict vivo behaviour network expanded include positive feedback model also reveals counterintuitive prediction noise protein expression levels can increase upon arrest cell growth division confirm experimentally work shows properties regulatory subsystems can used predict behaviour larger complex regulatory networks bottom-up approach can provide insights gene regulation
