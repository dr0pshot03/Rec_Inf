true navigation magnetic maps spiny lobsters 
animals capable true navigation displacement location never can determine position relative goal without relying familiar surroundings cues emanate destination information collected outward journey far animals vertebrates shown possess true navigation invertebrates carefully studied return target areas using path integration landmark recognition compass orientation mechanisms compensate displacements unfamiliar territory report however spiny lobster panulirus argus oriented reliably towards capture site displaced km unfamiliar locations even deprived known orientation cues en route little known lobsters animals determine position true navigation test hypothesis lobsters derive positional information earths magnetic field lobsters exposed fields replicating exist specific locations environment lobsters tested field north capture site oriented southwards whereas tested field south capture site oriented northwards results imply true navigation spiny lobsters perhaps animals based magnetic map sense
