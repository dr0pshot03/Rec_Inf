crosstalk microtubule attachment complexes ensures accurate chromosome segregation
microtubule-based mitotic spindle segregates chromosomes cell division chromosome segregation centromeric regions chromosomes build kinetochores establish end-coupled attachments spindle microtubules used caenorhabditis elegans embryo model system examine crosstalk two kinetochore protein complexes implicated temporally distinct stages attachment formation kinetochore dynein module mediates initial lateral microtubule capture inhibited microtubule binding ndc80 complex ultimately forms end-coupled attachments segregate chromosomes kinetochore dynein module directly regulated ndc80 independently phosphorylation aurora b kinase regulation required accurate segregation thus conversion initial dynein-mediated lateral attachments correctly oriented ndc80-mediated end-coupled attachments actively controlled
