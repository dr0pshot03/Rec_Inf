higher-order photon bunching semiconductor microcavity 
quantum mechanically indistinguishable particles photons may show collective behavior therefore appropriate description light field must consider properties assembly photons instead independent particles studied multiphoton correlations fourth order single-mode emission semiconductor microcavity weak strong coupling regimes counting statistics single photons recorded picosecond time resolution allowing quantitative measurement few-photon bunching inside light pulses results show bunching behavior strong coupling case vanishes weak coupling regime cavity starts lasing particular verify n factorial prediction zero-delay correlation function n thermal light photons
