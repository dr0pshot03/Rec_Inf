adaptive evolution multiple traits multiple mutations single gene
identification precise mutations required complete understanding underlying molecular evolutionary mechanisms driving adaptive phenotypic change using plasticine models field show light coat color deer mice recently colonized light-colored soil nebraska sand hills provides strong selective advantage visually hunting predators color variation admixed population suggests light sand hills phenotype composed multiple traits identified distinct regions within agouti locus associated color trait found haplotypes associated light trait values evidence selection thus local adaptation result independent selection many mutations within single locus specific effect adaptive phenotype thereby minimizing pleiotropic consequences
