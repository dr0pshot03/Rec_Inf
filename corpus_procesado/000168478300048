detection widespread fluids tibetan crust magnetotelluric studies
magnetotelluric exploration shown middle lower crust anomalously conductive across north-to-south width tibetan plateau integrated conductivity conductance tibetan crust ranges greater siemens contrast stable continental regions typically exhibit conductances siemens averaging siemens pervasively high conductance suggests partial melt and/or aqueous fluids widespread within tibetan crust southern tibet high-conductivity layer depth kilometers probably due partial melt aqueous fluids crust northern tibet conductive layer kilometers due partial melting zones fluid may represent weaker areas accommodate deformation nd lower crustal flow
