polymerizing actin fibers position integrins primed probe adhesion sites 
migrating cells extend protrusions probing surrounding matrix search permissive sites form adhesions found actin fibers polymerizing along leading edge directed local protrusions drove synchronous sideways movement beta1 integrin adhesion receptors movements lead clustering positioning conformationally activated unligated beta1 integrins along leading edge fibroblast lamellae growth cone filopodia thus rapid actin-based movement primed integrins along leading edge suggests "sticky fingers" mechanism probe new adhesion sites direct migration
