reconstitution dna segregation driven assembly prokaryotic actin homolog
multiple unrelated polymer systems evolved partition dna molecules daughter cells division better understand polymer-driven dna segregation reconstituted three-component segregation system r1 plasmid purified components found parr/parc complex can construct simple bipolar spindle binding ends parm filaments inhibiting dynamic instability acting ratchet permitting incorporation new monomers riding elongating filament ends steady-state conditions dynamic instability unattached parm filaments provides energy required drive dna segregation
