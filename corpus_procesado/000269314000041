linking p53 tumour suppressor pathway somatic cell reprogramming
reprogramming somatic cells induced pluripotent stem ips cells accomplished expressing pluripotency factors oncogenes- low frequency tendency induce malignant transformation compromise clinical utility powerful approach address issues investigating mechanisms limiting reprogramming efficiency somatic cells show reprogramming factors can activate p53 also known trp53 mice tp53 humans pathway reducing signalling p53 expressing mutated version one negative regulators deleting knocking p53 target gene p21 also known cdkn1a antagonizing reprogramming-induced apoptosis mouse fibroblasts increases reprogramming efficiency notably decreasing p53 protein levels enabled fibroblasts give rise ips cells capable generating germline-transmitting chimaeric mice using oct4 also known pou5f1 sox2 furthermore silencing p53 significantly increased reprogramming efficiency human somatic cells results provide insights reprogramming mechanisms suggest new routes efficient reprogramming minimizing use oncogenes
