vibrational transition moment angles isolated biomolecules: structural tool 
infrared spectroscopy used extensively study isolated biomolecules becomes less useful applied systems increasing complexity even individual vibrational bands can resolved spectroscopically assignment becomes problematic closely spaced can determined using ab initio methods describe method helps alleviate difficulty measuring direction vibrational transition moment vibrational band molecules interest adenine cytosine cooled kelvin liquid helium nanodroplets oriented large dc electric field polarized infrared laser used determine directions infrared transition moments relative permanent dipole moment comparisons ab initio calculations provide detailed structural information including experimental evidence nonplanarity adenine three tautomers cytosine
