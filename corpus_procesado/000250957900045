transgenerational plasticity adaptive wild 
plants exhibit adaptive responses light known whether parental plants transmit environmental cues elicit adaptive responses offspring show offspring life history annual versus biennial influenced maternal light environment understory versus light gap transgenerational plasticity adaptive offspring grown maternal light environment seeds typically disperse projections population growth show plants appropriately cued light environment maternal effects times greater fitness otherwise transgenerational plasticity evolved response natural variation light provides flexible mechanism sedentary organisms cope heterogeneous environments
