less cloudy future: role subtropical subsidence climate sensitivity
observable constraint climate sensitivity based variations mid-tropospheric relative humidity rh impact clouds proposed show tropics subtropics linked teleconnections induce seasonal rh variations relate strongly albedo via clouds covariability mimicked warming climate present-day analog future trends thus identified whereby intensity subtropical dry zones models associated boreal monsoon strongly linked projected cloud trends reflected solar radiation model sensitivity many models particularly low climate sensitivity fail adequately resolve teleconnections hence identifiably biased improving model fidelity matching observed variations provides viable path forward better predicting future climate
