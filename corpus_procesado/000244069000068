integration tgf-beta ras/mapk signaling p53 phosphorylation
development tissue homeostasis cells must integrate different signals investigated cell behavior controlled combined activity transforming growth factor-beta tgf-beta receptor tyrosine kinase rtk signaling whose integration mechanism unknown find rtk/ras/ mapk mitogen-activated protein kinase activity induces p53 n-terminal phosphorylation enabling interaction p53 tgf-beta-activated smads mechanism confines mesoderm specification xenopus embryos promotes tgf-beta cytostasis human cells data indicate mechanism allow extracellular cues specify tgf-beta gene-expression program
