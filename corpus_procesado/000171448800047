organic carbon composition marine sediments: effect oxygen exposure oil generation potential 
anaerobic sedimentary conditions traditionally linked generation source rocks petroleum formation however influence sedimentary redox conditions composition freshly deposited organic matter om clear assessed effect situ exposure time oxic conditions composition om accumulating different coastal deep-sea sediments using solid-state c- nuclear magnetic resonance nmr c- nmr spectra resolved mixtures mode[ components distinguish alkyl carbon present protein nonprotein structures inverse relation length exposure oxic conditions relative abundance nonprotein alkyl alkyl carbon whose concentration two orders magnitude higher coastal sediments short exposure times deep-sea sediments long exposure times alkylnp-rich samples contain physically separate polymethylene component similar composition algaenans kerogens type oil shales duration exposure oxic conditions appears directly influence quality oil generation potential om marine shales
