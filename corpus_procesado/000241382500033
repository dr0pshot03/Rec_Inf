correcting quantum errors entanglement
show entanglement shared encoder decoder can simplify theory quantum error correction entanglement-assisted quantum codes describe require dual-containing constraint necessary standard quantum error-correcting codes thus allowing us quantize classical linear coding theory particular efficient modern classical codes attain shannon capacity can made entanglement-assisted quantum codes attaining hashing bound closely related quantum capacity systems without large amounts shared entanglement codes can also used catalytic codes small amount initial entanglement enables quantum communication
