texture nanocrystalline nickel: probing lower size limit dislocation activity 
size nanocrystals provides limitation dislocation activity associated stress-induced deformation dislocation-mediated plastic deformation expected become inactive critical particle size proposed nanometers according computer simulations transmission electron microscopy analysis however deformation experiments high pressure polycrystalline nickel suggest dislocation activity still operative nanometer crystals substantial texturing observed pressures gigapascals nanometer nickel greater gigapascals nanometer nickel surprisingly texturing also seen nanometer nickel compressed gigapascals observations pressure-promoted texturing indicate high external pressures dislocation activity can extended few-nanometers-length scale
