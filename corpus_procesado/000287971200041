sorting platform determines order protein secretion bacterial type iii systems 
bacterial type iii protein secretion systems deliver effector proteins eukaryotic cells order modulate cellular processes central function protein-delivery machines ability recognize secrete substrates defined order describe mechanism type iii secretion system bacterial enteropathogen salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium can sort substrates secretion mechanism involves cytoplasmic sorting platform sequentially loaded appropriate secreted proteins sequential loading platform facilitated customized chaperones ensures hierarchy type iii protein secretion given presence machines many important pathogens findings can serve bases development novel antimicrobial strategies
