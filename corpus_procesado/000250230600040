nature superconductor-insulator transition disordered superconductors
interplay superconductivity disorder intrigued scientists several decades disorder expected enhance electrical resistance system whereas superconductivity associated zero-resistance state although superconductivity predicted persist even presence disorder experiments performed thin films demonstrated transition superconducting insulating state increasing disorder magnetic field nature transition still debate subject become even relevant realization high-transition-temperature high-t-c superconductors intrinsically disordered- present numerical simulations superconductor-insulator transition two-dimensional disordered superconductors starting microscopic description includes thermal phase fluctuations demonstrate explicitly disorder leads formation islands superconducting order high weak disorder high electron density increasing magnetic field results eventual vanishing amplitude superconducting order parameter thereby forming insulating state hand lower electron densities higher disorder increasing magnetic field suppresses correlations phases superconducting order parameter different islands giving rise different type superconductor-insulator transition one important predictions work regime high disorder still superconducting islands sample even insulating side transition result consistent experiments explains recently observed huge magneto-resistance peak disordered thin films- may relevant observation pseudo-gap phenomenon underdoped high-t-c superconductors
