transiting extrasolar planetary candidates galactic bulge 
extrasolar planets discovered around relatively nearby stars primarily doppler line shifts owing reflex motions host stars recently transits planets across faces host stars detection planets shortest known periods days mainly resulted transit surveys generally targeted stars massive m- m- mass sun report results planetary transit search performed rich stellar field towards galactic bulge discovered candidates orbital periods days five orbit stars masses range m- two cases radial-velocity measurements support planetary nature companions five candidates orbital periods day constituting new class ultra-short-period planets occur around stars less m- indicates orbiting close more-luminous stars might evaporatively destroyed jovian planets around stars lower mass might migrate smaller radii
