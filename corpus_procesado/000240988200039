quantum teleportation light matter
quantum teleportation important ingredient distributed quantum networks can also serve elementary operation quantum computers teleportation first demonstrated transfer quantum state light onto another light beam- later developments used optical relays demonstrated entanglement swapping continuous variables teleportation quantum state two single material particles trapped ions now also achieved demonstrate teleportation objects different nature light matter respectively represent flying stationary media quantum state encoded light pulse teleported onto macroscopic object atomic ensemble containing caesium atoms deterministic teleportation achieved sets coherent states mean photon number n hundred fidelities +/ n +/ n higher classical state transfer can possibly achieve besides fundamental interest teleportation using macroscopic atomic ensemble relevant practical implementation quantum repeater important factor implementation quantum networks teleportation distance transmitter receiver metres present experiment experiment uses propagating light achieve entanglement light atoms required teleportation present approach scalable longer distances
