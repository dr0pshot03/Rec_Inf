using temperature analyse temporal dynamics songbird motor pathway
many complex behaviours like speech music hierarchical organization structure many timescales known brain controls timing behavioural sequences whether different circuits control different timescales behaviour address issues using temperature manipulate biophysical dynamics different regions songbird forebrain involved song production find cooling premotor nucleus hvc formerly known high vocal centre slows song speed across timescales per cent slightly alters acoustic structure whereas cooling downstream motor nucleus ra robust nucleus arcopallium observable effect song timing observations suggest dynamics within hvc involved control song timing perhaps chain like organization local manipulation brain temperature broadly applicable identification neural circuitry controls timing behavioural sequences generally study origin role oscillatory forms brain dynamics neural systems
