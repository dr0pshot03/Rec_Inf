e3 ligase possessing iron-responsive hemerythrin domain regulator iron homeostasis
cellular iron homeostasis maintained coordinate posttranscriptional regulation genes responsible iron uptake release use storage actions iron regulatory proteins irp1 irp2 however manner iron levels sensed affect irp2 activity poorly understood found e3 ubiquitin ligase complex containing fbxl5 protein targets irp2 proteasomal degradation stability fbxl5 regulated accumulating iron-and oxygen-replete conditions degraded upon iron depletion fbxl5 contains iron-and oxygen-binding hemerythrin domain acted ligand-dependent regulatory switch mediating fbxl5s differential stability observations suggest mechanistic link iron sensing via fbxl5 hemerythrin domain irp2 regulation cellular responses maintain mammalian iron homeostasis
