widespread lateral gene transfer intracellular bacteria multicellular eukaryotes
although common among bacteria lateral gene transfer-the movement genes distantly related organisms-is thought occur rarely bacteria multicellular eukaryotes however presence endosymbionts wolbachia pipientis within eukaryotic germlines may facilitate bacterial gene transfers eukaryotic host genomes therefore examined host genomes evidence gene transfer events wolbachia bacteria hosts found confirmed transfers genomes four insect four nematode species range nearly entire wolbachia genome > megabase short < base pairs insertions potential wolbachia-to-host transfers also detected computationally three additional sequenced insect genomes also show inserted wolbachia genes transcribed within eukaryotic cells lacking endosymbionts therefore heritable lateral gene transfer occurs eukaryotic hosts prokaryote symbionts potentially providing mechanism acquisition new genes functions
