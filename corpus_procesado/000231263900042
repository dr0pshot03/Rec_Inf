unexpectedly rapid decline x-ray afterglow emission long gamma-ray bursts 
long gamma-ray bursts grbs commonly accepted originate explosion particularly massive stars give rise highly relativistic jets inhomogeneities expanding flow result internal shock waves believed produce gamma-rays see jet travels outward surrounding circumstellar medium external shocks create afterglow emission seen x-ray optical radio bands report observations early phases x-ray emission five grbs x-ray light curves characterised surprisingly rapid fall-off first hundred seconds followed less rapid decline lasting several hours steep decline together detailed spectral properties two particular bursts shows violent shock interactions take place early jet outflows
