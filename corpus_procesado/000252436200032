elementary structural motifs random network cytosine adsorbed gold surface
nonsymmetrical organic molecules adsorbed solid surfaces may assemble random networks thereby providing model systems organic glasses can directly observed scanning tunneling microscopy stm investigated structure disordered cytosine network gold surface created thermal quenching temperatures k two dimensional fluid present surface room temperature comparison stm images density functional theory calculations allowed us identify three elementary structural motifs zigzag filaments five six membered rings underlie whole supramolecular random network identification elementary structural motifs may provide new framework understanding medium range order amorphous glassy systems
