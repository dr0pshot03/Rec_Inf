quantum interference two single photons emitted independently trapped atoms 
two indistinguishable single photons fed two input ports beam splitter photons will coalesce leave together output port quantum interference effect occurs two possible paths photons leave different output ports interfere destructively effect first observed parametric downconversion1 nonlinear crystal splits single photon two photons lower energy two separate downconversion crystals2 well single photons produced one quantum emitter3- recent developments quantum information research much attention devoted interference effect resource quantum data processing using linear optics techniques27- ensure scalability schemes based ideas crucial indistinguishable photons emitted collection synchronized otherwise independent sources demonstrate quantum interference two single photons emitted two independently trapped single atoms bridging gap towards simultaneous emission many indistinguishable single photons different emitters data analysis shows observed coalescence mainly limited wavefront matching light emitted two atoms lesser extent motion atom trap
