regulation neuroblast competence drosophila
individual neural progenitors generate different cell types reproducible order retina- cerebral cortex- probably spinal cord unknown neural progenitors change time generate different cell types proposed progenitors undergo progressive restriction transit distinct competence states however underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear investigate neural progenitor competence temporal identity using vivo genetic system-drosophila neuroblasts-where hunchback transcription factor necessary sufficient specify early-born cell types show neuroblasts gradually lose competence generate early-born fates response hunchback similar progressive restriction models competence acquire early-born fates present mitotic precursors lost post-mitotic neurons results match observed vertebrate systems establish drosophila neuroblasts model system molecular genetic analysis neural progenitor competence plasticity
