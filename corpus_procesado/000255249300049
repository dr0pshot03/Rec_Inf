plastin protective modifier autosomal recessive spinal muscular atrophy 
homozygous deletion survival motor neuron gene smn1 causes spinal muscular atrophy sma frequent genetic cause early childhood lethality rare instances however individuals asymptomatic despite carrying smn1 mutations affected siblings thereby suggesting influence modifier genes discovered unaffected smn1 deleted females exhibit significantly higher expression plastin pls3 sma affected counterparts demonstrated pls3 important axonogenesis increasing f actin level overexpression pls3 rescued axon length outgrowth defects associated smn regulation motor neurons sma mouse embryos zebrafish study suggests defects axonogenesis major cause sma thereby opening new therapeutic options sma similar neuromuscular diseases
