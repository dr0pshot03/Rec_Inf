asymmetric division drosophila male germline stem cell shows asymmetric histone distribution
stem cells can self-renew generate differentiating daughter cells known whether cells maintain epigenetic information asymmetric division using dual-color method differentially label old versus new histones drosophila male germline stem cells gscs show preexisting canonical h3 variant h3 histones selectively segregated gsc whereas newly synthesized histones incorporated dna replication enriched differentiating daughter cell asymmetric histone distribution occurs gscs symmetrically dividing progenitor cells furthermore gscs genetically manipulated divide symmetrically asymmetric mode lost work suggests stem cells retain preexisting canonical histones asymmetric cell divisions probably mechanism maintain unique molecular properties
