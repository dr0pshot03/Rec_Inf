dynamics dna supercoils
dna cells exhibits supercoiled state double helix additionally twisted form extended intertwined loops called plectonemes although supercoiling vital many cellular processes dynamics remain elusive work directly visualize dynamics individual plectonemes observe multiple plectonemes can present number depends applied stretching force ionic strength plectonemes moved along dna diffusion unexpectedly fast hopping process facilitated rapid < milliseconds long-range plectoneme displacement nucleating new plectoneme distant position observations directly reveal dynamics plectonemes identify mode movement allows long-distance reorganization conformation genome millisecond time scale
