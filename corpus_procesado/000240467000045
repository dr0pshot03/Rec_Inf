land-atmosphere coupling climate change europe
increasing greenhouse gas concentrations expected enhance interannual variability summer climate europe- mid-latitude regions potentially causing frequent heatwaves climate models consistently predict increase variability summer temperatures areas underlying mechanisms responsible increase remain uncertain explore mechanisms using regional simulations recent future climatic conditions without land atmosphere interactions results indicate increase summer temperature variability predicted central eastern europe mainly due feedbacks land surface atmosphere furthermore suggest land atmosphere interactions increase climate variability region climatic regimes europe shift northwards response increasing greenhouse gas concentrations creating new transitional climate zone strong land atmosphere coupling central eastern europe findings emphasize importance soil moisture temperature feedbacks addition soil moisture precipitation feedbacks- influencing summer climate variability potential migration climate zones strong land atmosphere coupling consequence global warming highlights crucial role land atmosphere interactions future climate change
