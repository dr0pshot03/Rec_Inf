regulation axon growth vivo activity-based competition 
formation functional neural networks requires precise regulation growth branching terminal arbors axons processes known influenced early network electrical activity- show rule activity-based competition neighbouring axons appears govern growth branching retinal ganglion cell rgc axon arbors developing optic tectum zebrafish mosaic expression exogenous potassium channel dominant-negative snare protein used suppress electrical neurosecretory activity subsets rgc axons imaging vivo showed forms activity suppression strongly inhibit net growth formation new branches individually transfected rgc axon arbors inhibition relieved activity nearby competing rgc axons also suppressed results therefore identify new form activity-based competition rule might key regulator axon growth branch initiation
