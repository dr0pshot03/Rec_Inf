plant recognition symbiotic bacteria requires two lysm receptor-like kinases
although higher plants establish symbiosis arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi symbiotic nitrogen fixation rhizobia salient feature legumes despite host range difference mycorrhizal rhizobial invasion shares common plant-specified genetic programme controlling early host interaction one feature distinguishing legumes ability perceive rhizobial-specific signal molecules describe two lysm-type serine/threonine receptor kinase genes nfr1 nfr5 enabling model legume lotus japonicus recognize bacterial microsymbiont mesorhizobium loti extracellular domains two transmembrane kinases resemble lysm domains peptidoglycan chitin-binding proteins suggesting may involved directly perception rhizobial lipochitin-oligosaccharide signal show nfr1 nfr5 required earliest physiological cellular responses lipochitin-oligosaccharide signal demonstrate role mechanism establishing susceptibility legume root bacterial infection
