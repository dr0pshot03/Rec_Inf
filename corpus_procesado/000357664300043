single-trial spike trains parietal cortex reveal discrete steps decision-making
neurons macaque lateral intraparietal lip area exhibit firing rates appear ramp upward downward decision-making ramps commonly assumed reflect gradual accumulation evidence toward decision threshold however ramping trial-averaged responses instead arise instantaneous jumps different times different trials examined single-trial responses lip using statistical methods fitting comparing latent dynamical spike-train models compared models latent spike rates governed either continuous diffusion-to-bound dynamics discrete stepping dynamics roughly three-quarters choice-selective neurons recorded better described stepping model moreover inferred steps carried information animals choice spike counts
