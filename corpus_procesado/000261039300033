structure guide-strand-containing argonaute silencing complex
slicer activity rna induced silencing complex associated argonaute rnase h like piwi domain catalyses guide strand mediated sequence specific cleavage target messenger rna report crystal structure thermus thermophilus argonaute bound phosphorylated base dna guide strand thereby identifying nucleic acid binding channel positioned paz piwi containing lobes well pivot like conformational changes associated complex formation bound guide strand anchored ends solvent exposed watson crick edges stacked bases positioned nucleation mrna target whereas two critically positioned arginines lock bases cleavage site unanticipated orthogonal alignment biochemical studies indicate key amino acid residues active site lining phosphate binding pocket made mid domain critical cleavage activity whereas alterations residues lining nucleotide end binding pocket made paz domain show little effect
