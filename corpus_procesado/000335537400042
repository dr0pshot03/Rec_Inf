spatially distributed local fields hippocampus encode rat position 
although neuronal spikes can readily detected extracellular recordings synaptic subthreshold activity remains undifferentiated within local field potential lfp hippocampus neurons discharge selectively rat certain locations lfps single anatomical sites exhibit place-tuning nonetheless representation position sparse distributed hypothesized spatial information can recovered multiple-site lfp recordings using high-density sampling lfp computational methods show spatiotemporal structure theta rhythm can encode position robustly neuronal spiking populations approach exploits rhythmicity sparse structure neural activity features found many brain regions useful general tool discovering distributed lfp codes
