gap junctions compensate sublinear dendritic integration inhibitory network
electrically coupled inhibitory interneurons dynamically control network excitability yet little known chemical electrical synapses regulate activity using two-photon glutamate uncaging dendritic patch-clamp recordings found dendrites cerebellar golgi interneurons acted passive cables conferred distance-dependent sublinear synaptic integration weakened distal excitatory inputs gap junctions present higher density distal dendrites contributed substantially membrane conductance depolarization one golgi cell increased firing neighbors inclusion dendritic gap junctions interneuron network models enabled distal excitatory synapses drive network activity effectively results suggest dendritic gap junctions counteract sublinear dendritic integration enabling excitatory synaptic charge spread dendrites neighboring inhibitory interneurons
