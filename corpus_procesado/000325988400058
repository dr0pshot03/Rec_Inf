alpha tat1 catalyses microtubule acetylation clathrin-coated pits 
eukaryotic cells microtubules undergo post-translational modifications acetylation alpha-tubulin lysine wide-spread modification restricted subset microtubules turns slowly subset stable microtubules accumulates cell protrusions regulates cell polarization migration invasion- however mechanisms restricting acetylation microtubules unknown report clathrin-coated pits ccps control microtubule acetylation direct interaction alpha-tubulin acetyltransferase alpha tat1 refs clathrin adaptor ap2 observe one-third growing microtubule ends contact pause ccps loss ccps decreases lysine acetylation levels show alpha tat1 localizes ccps direct interaction ap2 required microtubule acetylation migrating cells polarized orientation acetylated microtubules correlates ccp accumulation leading edge interaction alpha tat1 ap2 required directional migration conclude microtubules contacting ccps become acetylated alpha tat1 migrating cells mechanism ensures acetylation microtubules oriented towards leading edge thus promoting directional cell locomotion chemotaxis
