triggering cell shape change exploiting preexisting actomyosin contractions
apical constriction changes cell shapes driving critical morphogenetic events including gastrulation diverse organisms neural tube closure vertebrates apical constriction thought triggered contraction apical actomyosin networks found apical actomyosin contractions began cell shape changes caenorhabitis elegans drosophila c elegans actomyosin networks initially dynamic contracting generating cortical tension without substantial shrinking apical surfaces apical cell-cell contact zones actomyosin later moved increasingly concert detectable change actomyosin dynamics cortical tension thus apical constriction appears triggered change cortical tension dynamic linking apical cell-cell contact zones already contractile apical cortex
