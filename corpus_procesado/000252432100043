brain mechanisms communication must establish correspondence sensory motor codes used represent signal one idea correspondence established level single neurons active individual performs particular gesture observes similar gesture performed another individual although neurons display precise auditory vocal correspondence facilitate vocal communication yet identified report certain class neurons swamp sparrow forebrain displays precise auditory vocal correspondence show neurons respond temporally precise fashion auditory presentation certain note sequences songbirds repertoire similar note sequences birds songs neurons display nearly identical patterns activity bird sings sequence disrupting auditory feedback alter singing related activity indicating motor nature furthermore neurons innervate striatal structures important song learning raising possibility singing related activity cells compared auditory feedback guide vocal learning
