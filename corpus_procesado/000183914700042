low potential climatic stress adaptation rainforest drosophila species
ability sensitive rainforest species evolve response climate change largely unknown show australian tropical rainforest fly drosophila birchii exhibits clinal variation desiccation resistance resistant population lacks ability evolve resistance even intense selection generations parent-offspring comparisons indicate low heritable variation trait high levels genetic variation morphology d birchii also exhibits abundant genetic variation microsatellite loci low potential resistance evolution highlights importance assessing evolutionary potential targeted ecological traits species threatened habitats
