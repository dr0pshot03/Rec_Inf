diapir-induced reorientation saturns moon enceladus 
enceladus small icy satellite saturn south polar region consists young tectonically deformed terrain anomalously high heat flux heat flux probably due localized tidal dissipation within either ice shell underlying silicate core surface deformation plausibly due upwelling low-density material diapirism result tidal heating show current polar location hotspot can explained reorientation satellites rotation axis presence low-density diapir diapir ice shell shell must relatively thick maintain significant rigidity elastic thickness greater similar km diapir silicate core enceladus possess global subsurface ocean core must coupled overlying ice reorientation occur reorientation generates large similar mpa tectonic stress patterns compatible observed deformation south polar region predict distribution impact craters surface will show usual leading hemisphere trailing hemisphere asymmetry low-density diapir also yields potentially observable negative gravity anomaly
