chaperone-mediated pathway proteasome regulatory particle assembly 
proteasome protease controls diverse processes eukaryotic cells regulatory particle rp initiates degradation ubiquitin-protein conjugates unfolding substrate translocating proteasome core particle cp degraded rp subunits pathway assembly understood show yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae three proteins found associated rp rp-cp holoenzyme: nas6 rpn14 hsm3 mutations corresponding genes confer proteasome loss-of-function phenotypes despite virtual absence holoenzyme effects result deficient rp assembly thus nas6 rpn14 hsm3 rp chaperones rp contains six atpases-the rpt proteins-and rp chaperone binds carboxy-terminal domain specific rpt show accompanying study rp assembly templated rpt c termini apparently insertion binding pockets cp thus rp chaperones may regulate proteasome assembly directly restricting accessibility rpt c termini cp addition competition rp chaperones cp rpt engagement may explain release rp chaperones proteasomes mature
