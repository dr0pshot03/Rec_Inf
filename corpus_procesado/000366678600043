growth splitting neural sequences songbird vocal development
neural sequences fundamental feature brain dynamics underlying diverse behaviours mechanisms develop learning remain unknown songbirds learn vocalizations composed syllables adult birds syllable produced different sequence action potential bursts premotor cortical area hvc carried recordings large populations hvc neurons singing juvenile birds throughout learning examine emergence neural sequences early vocal development hvc neurons begin producing rhythmic bursts temporally locked prototype syllable different neurons active different latencies relative syllable onset form continuous sequence development new syllables emerge prototype syllable initially highly overlapping burst sequences become increasingly distinct propose mechanistic model multiple neural sequences can emerge growth splitting common precursor sequence
