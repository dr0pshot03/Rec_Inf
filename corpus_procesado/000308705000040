initiation cell wall pattern rho microtubule-driven symmetry breaking
specifically patterned cell wall determinant plant cell shape yet precise mechanisms underlie initiation cell wall patterning remain elusive using reconstitution assay revealed ropgef4 rho plant guanine nucleotide exchange factor ropgap3 [rop guanosine triphosphatase gtpase-activating protein ] mediate local activation plant rho gtpase rop11 initiate distinct pattern secondary cell walls xylem cells activated rop11 recruits midd1 induce local disassembly cortical microtubules conversely cortical microtubules eliminate active rop11 plasma membrane midd1 mutual inhibitory interaction active rop domains cortical microtubules establishes distinct pattern secondary cell walls rho-based regulatory mechanism shows plant cells initiate control cell wall patterns form various cell shapes
