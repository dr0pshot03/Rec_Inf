kinesin moves asymmetric hand-over-hand mechanism 
kinesin double-headed motor protein moves along microtubules nanometer steps two broad classes model invoked explain kinesin movement: hand-over-hand inchworm hand-over-hand models heads exchange leading trailing roles every step whereas exchange postulated inchworm models one head always leads measuring stepwise motion individual enzymes find kinesin molecules exhibit marked alternation dwell times sequential steps causing motors limp along microtubule limping implies kinesin molecules strictly alternate two different conformations step indicative asymmetric hand-over-hand mechanism
