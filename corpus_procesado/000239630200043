dynamics melt shear localization partially molten aggregates 
volcanoes lie along earths tectonic boundaries fed melt generated mantle melt extracted focused volcanoes however remains unresolved question present new theoretical results implications melt focusing beneath mid ocean ridges modelling laboratory experiments test formulation magma dynamics provide explanation localized bands high porosity concentrated shear deformation observed experiments bands emerge persist degrees degrees plane shear past theoretical work system predicted emergence melt bands angle inconsistent experiments results suggest observed band angle results balance porosity weakening strain rate weakening deformation mechanisms lower band angles predicted greater strain-rate weakening lower band angles estimate orientation melt bands beneath mid ocean ridges show may enhance magma focusing toward ridge axis
