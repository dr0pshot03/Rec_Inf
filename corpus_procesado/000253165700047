axle-less f--atpase rotates correct direction 
f- adenosine triphosphatase atpase atp driven rotary molecular motor central gamma subunit rotates inside cylinder made three alpha three beta subunits alternately arranged rotor shaft antiparallel alpha helical coiled coil amino carboxyl termini gamma subunit deeply penetrates central cavity stator cylinder truncated shaft step step remaining rotor head outside cavity simply sat concave entrance stator orifice truncation mutants rotated correct direction implying torque generation although average rotary speeds low short mutants exhibited moments irregular motion neither fixed pivot rigid axle needed rotation f- atpase
