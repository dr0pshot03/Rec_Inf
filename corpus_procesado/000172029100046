linear processing spatial cues primary auditory cortex 
determine direction sound source space animals must process variety auditory spatial cues including interaural level time differences well changes sound spectrum caused direction-dependent filtering sound outer ear behavioural deficits observed primary auditory cortex a1 damaged led widespread view a1 may essential role complex computational task- show however spatial selectivity exhibited large majority a1 neurons well predicted simple linear model assumes neurons additively integrate sound levels frequency band ear success linear model surprising given computing sound source direction necessarily nonlinear operation- however linear operations preserve information results consistent hypothesis a1 may also form gateway higher specialized cortical areas
