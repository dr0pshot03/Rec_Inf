atmospheric loss oxygen ions earth magnetospheric processes
earths environment observed polar outflow rate o+ ions main source oxygen gravitational escape energy corresponds loss similar % present-day atmospheric oxygen billion years however part apparent loss can actually returned atmosphere examining loss rates four escape routes high-altitude spacecraft observations show total oxygen loss rate inferred current knowledge one order magnitude smaller polar o+ outflow rate disagreement suggests may substantial return flux magnetosphere low-latitude ionosphere net oxygen loss billion years drops similar to2% current atmospheric oxygen content
