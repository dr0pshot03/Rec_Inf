probing spin-charge separation tomonaga-luttinger liquid 
one-dimensional 1d system interacting electrons excitations spin charge travel different speeds according theory tomonaga-luttinger liquid tll low energies however clear observation spin-charge separation ongoing challenge experimentally fabricated electrostatically gated 1d system observe spin-charge separation also predicted power-law suppression tunneling 1d system spin-charge separation persists even beyond low-energy regime tll approximation hold tll effects therefore also important similar shorter electrostatically gated wires interaction effects studied extensively worldwide
