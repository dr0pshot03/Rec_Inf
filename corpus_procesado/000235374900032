development animal body plan controlled large gene regulatory networks grns hence evolution body plans must depend upon change architecture developmental grns however networks composed diverse components evolve different rates different ways hierarchical organization developmental grns kinds change affect terminal properties body plan occur speciation whereas others affect major aspects body plan morphology notable feature paleontological record animal evolution establishment early cambrian virtually phylum-level body plans identify class grn component kernels network developmental rote particular internal structure impervious change conservation phyletic body plans may due retention since pre-cambrian time grn kernels underlie development major body parts
