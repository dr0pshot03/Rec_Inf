asymmetrical distribution second messenger c-di-gmp upon bacterial cell division 
bacterial second messenger cyclic diguanosine monophosphate c-di-gmp regulates cellular motility synthesis organelles molecules promote adhesion variety biological nonbiological surfaces properties likely require tight spatial temporal regulation c-di-gmp concentration developed genetically encoded fluorescence resonance energy transfer fret-based biosensors monitor c-di-gmp concentrations within single bacterial cells microscopy fluctuations c-di-gmp visualized diverse gram-negative bacterial species observed cell cycle dependent asymmetrical distribution c-di-gmp progeny correlated time cell division polarization caulobacter crescentus pseudomonas aeruginosa thus asymmetrical distribution c-di-gmp observed part cell division may indicate important regulatory step extracellular organelle biosynthesis function
