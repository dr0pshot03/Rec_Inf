association nod2 leucine-rich repeat variants susceptibility crohns disease
crohns disease ulcerative colitis two main types chronic inflammatory bowel disease multifactorial conditions unknown aetiology susceptibility locus crohns disease mapped chromosome used positional-cloning strategy based linkage analysis followed linkage disequilibrium mapping identify three independent associations crohns disease: frameshift variant two missense variants nod2 encoding member apaf-/ced superfamily apoptosis regulators expressed monocytes nod2 variants alter structure either leucine-rich repeat domain protein adjacent region nod2 activates nuclear factor nf-kb activating function regulated carboxy-terminal leucine-rich repeat domain inhibitory role also acts intracellular receptor components microbial pathogens observations suggest nod2 gene product confers susceptibility crohns disease altering recognition components and/or over-activating nf-kb monocytes thus documenting molecular model pathogenic mechanism crohns disease can now investigated
