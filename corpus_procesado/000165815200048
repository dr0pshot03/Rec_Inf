elf3 zeitnehmer regulates light signalling circadian clock 
circadian system regulates hour biological rhythms seasonal rhythms flowering long-day flowering plants like arabidopsis thaliana measure day length rhythm reset lights-off whereas short-day plants measure night length basis circadian rhythm light sensitivity set dusk early flowering elf3 mutants arabinopsis aphotoperiodic exhibit light-conditional arrhythmia show elf3 mutant retains oscillator function light blunts circadian gating cab gene activation indicating deregulated phototransduction may mask rhythmicity furthermore elf3 mutations confer resetting pattern short-day photoperiodism indicating gating phototransduction may control resetting temperature entrainment can bypass requirement normal elf3 function oscillator partially restore rhythmic cab expression therefore elf3 specifically affects light input oscillator similar function gating cab activation allowing oscillator progression past light-sensitive phase subjective evening elf3 provides experimental demonstration zeitnehmer time-taker concept
