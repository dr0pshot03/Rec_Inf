biological sensing small field differences magnetically sensitive chemical reactions
evidence animals can detect small changes earths magnetic field two distinct mechanisms one using mineral magnetite primary sensor one using magnetically sensitive chemical reactions- magnetite responds physically twisting even reorienting whole organism case bacteria magnetic dipoles individual molecules small respond way assess whether reactions whose rates affected orientation reactants magnetic fields form basis biological compass use general model incorporating biological components design criteria calculate realistic constraints compass model compares chemical signal produced owing magnetic field effects stochastic noise changes due physiological temperature variation analysis shows chemically based biological compass feasible size given detection limit dependent magnetic sensitivity rate constant chemical reaction
