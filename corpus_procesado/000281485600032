shifting balance diversity among major marine animal groups 
fossil record demonstrates major taxonomic group consistent net rate diversification limit species richness thought long-term changes dominance major taxonomic groups can predicted characteristics however new analyses show diversity limits may rise fall response adaptive radiations extinctions changes idiosyncratic occur different times taxa example end-permian mass extinction permanently reduced diversity important previously dominant groups brachiopods crinoids current global crisis may therefore permanently alter biospheres taxonomic composition changing rules evolution
