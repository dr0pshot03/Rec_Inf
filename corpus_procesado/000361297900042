non-adaptive plasticity potentiates rapid adaptive evolution gene expression nature 
phenotypic plasticity capacity individual genotype produce different phenotypes response environmental variation traits plastic degree plasticity adaptive non-adaptive depends whether environmentally induced phenotypes closer away local optimum- existing theories make conflicting predictions whether plasticity constrains facilitates adaptive evolution- debate persists empirical studies tested relationship initial plasticity subsequent adaptive evolution natural populations show direction plasticity gene expression generally opposite direction adaptive evolution experimentally transplanted trinidadian guppies poecilia reticulata adapted living cichlid predators cichlid-free streams tested evolutionary divergence brain gene expression patterns three four generations find transcripts evolved parallel changes expression within replicated introduction populations changes direction exhibited native cichlid-free population suggesting rapid adaptive evolution find % transcripts exhibited non-adaptive plastic changes expression source population reared absence predators opposite direction evolved changes contrast remaining transcripts exhibiting adaptive plasticity show reduced population divergence furthermore plastic transcripts source population evolved reduced plasticity introduction populations suggesting strong selection non-adaptive plasticity results support models predicting adaptive plasticity constrains evolution- whereas non-adaptive plasticity potentiates evolution increasing strength directional selection role non-adaptive plasticity evolution received relatively little attention however results suggest may important mechanism predicts evolutionary responses new environments
