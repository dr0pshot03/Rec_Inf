hippocampal neurogenesis regulates forgetting adulthood infancy
throughout life new neurons continuously added dentate gyrus continuous addition remodels hippocampal circuits computational models predict neurogenesis leads degradation forgetting established memories consistent increasing neurogenesis formation memory sufficient induce forgetting adult mice contrast infancy hippocampal neurogenesis levels high freshly generated memories tend rapidly forgotten infantile amnesia decreasing neurogenesis memory formation mitigated forgetting precocial species including guinea pigs degus granule cells generated prenatally consistent reduced levels postnatal hippocampal neurogenesis infant guinea pigs degus exhibit forgetting however increasing neurogenesis memory formation induced infantile amnesia species
