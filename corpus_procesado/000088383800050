motif alpha beta t-cell receptor controls positive selection modulating erk activity
positive selection allows thymocytes recognize individuals major histocompatibility complex self-mhc molecules survive differentiate whereas negative selection removes overtly self-reactive thymocytes although forms thymic selection mediated alpha beta t-cell receptor tcr require self-mhc recognition important question whether controlled distinct signalling cascades shown mutation essential motif within tcr alpha-chain-connecting peptide domain alpha-cpm profoundly affects positive negative selection using transgenic mice expressing mutant alpha-cpm tcr examined contribution several mitogen-activated protein kinase mapk cascades thymic selection show thymocytes expressing mutant alpha-cpm receptor positively selecting peptide failed activate extracellular signal-regulated kinase erk although mapk cascades induced normally defect erk activation associated impaired recruitment activated tyrosine kinases lck zap- phosphorylated forms tcr component cd3 zeta adaptor protein lat detergent-insoluble glycolipid-enriched microdomains digs therefore intact dig-associated signalosome essential sustained erk activation leads positive selection
