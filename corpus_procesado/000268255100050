chiral isotropic liquids achiral molecules 
variety simple bent-core molecules exhibit smectic liquid crystal phases planar fluid layers spontaneously polar chiral absence crystalline order found intralayer structural mismatch layers also marginally stable spontaneous saddle splay deformation incompatible long-range order results macroscopically isotropic fluids possess short-range orientational positional order macroscopically broken symmetry chirality-even though phases formed achiral molecules conglomerate domains exhibit optical rotatory powers comparable highest ever found isotropic fluids chiral molecules
