spatial regulation e3 ubiquitin ligase directs selective synapse elimination 
stereotyped synaptic connectivity can arise precise recognition appropriate partners synaptogenesis selective synapse elimination molecular mechanisms underlie selective synapse removal largely unknown found stereotyped developmental elimination synapses caenorhabditis elegans hermaphrodite-specific motor neuron hsnl mediated e3 ubiquitin ligase skp1-cullin-f-box scf complex composed skr- f-box protein sel- syg- synaptic adhesion molecule bound skr- inhibited assembly scf complex thereby protecting nearby synapses thus subcellular regulation ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation contributes precise synaptic connectivity selective synapse elimination
