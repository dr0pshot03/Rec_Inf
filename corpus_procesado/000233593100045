physical properties lightly doped semiconductors well described electronic band structure calculations impurity energy levels1 properties form basis present day semiconductor technology doping concentration n exceeds critical value nc system passes insulator metal transition exhibits metallic behaviour; widely accepted occur consequence impurity levels merging form energy bands2 however electronic structure semiconductors doped beyond nc explored detail therefore recent observation superconductivity emerging near insulator metal transition3 heavily boron doped diamond45 stimulated discussion fundamental origin metallic states responsible superconductivity two approaches adopted describing metallic state: introduction charge carriers either impurity bands6 intrinsic diamond bands7- show experimentally doping dependent occupied electronic structures consistent diamond bands indicating holes diamond bands play essential part determining metallic nature heavily boron doped diamond superconductor supports diamond band approach related predictions including possibility achieving dopant induced superconductivity silicon germanium7 also provide foundation possible development diamond based devices10
