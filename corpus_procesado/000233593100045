origin metallic properties heavily boron-doped superconducting diamond 
physical properties lightly doped semiconductors well described electronic band structure calculations impurity energy levels properties form basis present day semiconductor technology doping concentration n exceeds critical value nc system passes insulator metal transition exhibits metallic behaviour widely accepted occur consequence impurity levels merging form energy bands however electronic structure semiconductors doped beyond nc explored detail therefore recent observation superconductivity emerging near insulator metal transition heavily boron doped diamond stimulated discussion fundamental origin metallic states responsible superconductivity two approaches adopted describing metallic state: introduction charge carriers either impurity bands intrinsic diamond bands- show experimentally doping dependent occupied electronic structures consistent diamond bands indicating holes diamond bands play essential part determining metallic nature heavily boron doped diamond superconductor supports diamond band approach related predictions including possibility achieving dopant induced superconductivity silicon germanium also provide foundation possible development diamond based devices
