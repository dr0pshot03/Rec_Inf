dscam diversity essential neuronal wiring self-recognition 
neurons thought use diverse families cell-surface molecules cell recognition circuit assembly drosophila alternative splicing syndrome cell adhesion molecule dscam gene potentially generates closely related transmembrane proteins immunoglobulin superfamily comprising one alternative ectodomains linked one two alternative transmembrane segments ectodomains show isoform-specific homophilic binding leading speculation dscam proteins mediate cell recognition genetic studies established dscam required neural circuit assembly- extent isoform diversity contributes process known provide conclusive evidence dscam diversity essential circuit assembly using homologous recombination reduced entire repertoire dscam ectodomains just single isoform neural circuits mutants severely disorganized furthermore show crucial neighbouring neurons express distinct isoforms specific identity isoforms expressed individual neuron unimportant conclude dscam diversity provides neuron unique identity can distinguish processes neurons self-recognition essential wiring drosophila brain
