glutamate receptors atomic resolution 
synapses throughout brain spinal cord amino-acid glutamate major excitatory neurotransmitter evolution family glutamate-receptor ion channels seems assembled kit consisting discrete ligand-binding ion-channel modulatory cytoplasmic domains crystallographic studies exploit unique architecture greatly aided structural analysis ligand-binding core results also pose formidable challenge namely resolving allosteric mechanisms individual domains communicate function intact receptor
