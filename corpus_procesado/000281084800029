dual jets binary black holes 
coalescence supermassive black holes-a natural outcome galaxies merge-should produce gravitational waves likely associated energetic electromagnetic events studied coalescence binary black holes within external magnetic field produced expected circumbinary disk surrounding solving einstein equations describe black holes interacting surrounding plasma present numerical evidence possible jets driven systems extending process described blandford znajek single spinning black hole picture emerges suggests electromagnetic field extracts energy orbiting black holes ultimately merge settle standard blandford-znajek scenario emissions along jets potentially observable large distances
