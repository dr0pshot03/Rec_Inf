interactions cop9 signalosome e3 ubiquitin ligase scftir1 mediating auxin response 
cop9 signalosome evolutionary conserved multiprotein complex unknown function acts negative regulator photomorphogenic seedling development arabidopsis show plants reduced cop9 signalosome levels decreased auxin response similar loss-of-function mutants e3 ubiquitin ligase scftir1 furthermore found cop9 signalosome scftir1 interacted vivo cop9 signalosome required efficient degradation psiaa6 candidate substrate scftir1 thus cop9 signalosome may play important role mediating e3 ubiquitin ligase-mediated responses
