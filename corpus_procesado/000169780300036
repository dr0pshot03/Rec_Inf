epigenetic instability es cells cloned mice 
cloning nuclear transfer nt inefficient process clones die birth survivors often display growth abnormalities effort correlate gene expression survival fetal overgrowth examined imprinted gene expression mice cloned nuclear transfer embryonic stem es cell donor populations derived epigenetic state es cell genome found extremely unstable similarly variation imprinted gene expression observed cloned mice even derived es cells subclone many animals survived adulthood despite widespread gene dysregulation indicating mammalian development may rather tolerant epigenetic aberrations genome data imply even apparently normal cloned animals may subtle abnormalities gene expression
