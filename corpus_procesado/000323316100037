histone h4 lysine acetyltransferase hmof regulates outcome autophagy
autophagy evolutionarily conserved catabolic process involved several physiological pathological processes although primarily cytoprotective autophagy can also contribute cell death thus important understand distinguishes life death decision autophagic cells report induction autophagy coupled reduction histone h4 lysine acetylation h4k16ac downregulation histone acetyltransferase hmof also called kat8 myst1 demonstrate histone modification regulates outcome autophagy genome-wide level find h4k16 deacetylation associated predominantly downregulation autophagy-related genes antagonizing h4k16ac downregulation upon autophagy induction results promotion cell death findings establish alteration specific histone post-translational modification autophagy affects transcriptional regulation autophagy-related genes initiates regulatory feedback loop serves key determinant survival versus death responses upon autophagy induction
