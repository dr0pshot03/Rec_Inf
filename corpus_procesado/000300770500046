abrupt acceleration cold ultrarelativistic wind crab pulsar
pulsars thought eject electron-positron winds energize surrounding environment formation pulsar wind nebula pulsar wind originates close light cylinder surface pulsar co-rotation velocity equals speed light carries away much rotational energy lost pulsar initially wind dominated electromagnetic energy poynting flux later converted kinetic energy bulk motion unclear exactly takes place speed wind accelerated although preferred models imply gradual acceleration entire distance magnetosphere point wind terminates rapid acceleration close light cylinder excluded report recent observations pulsed high-energy gamma-ray emission crab pulsar- explained presence cold sense low energy electrons frame moving plasma ultrarelativistic wind dominated kinetic energy conversion poynting flux kinetic energy take place abruptly narrow cylindrical zone radius light-cylinder radii centred axis rotation pulsar accelerate wind lorentz factor - x although ultrarelativistic nature wind support general model pulsars requirement high acceleration wind narrow zone far light cylinder challenges current models
