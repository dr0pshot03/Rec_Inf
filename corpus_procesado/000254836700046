leiomodin actin filament nucleator muscle cells
initiation actin polymerization cells requires nucleation factors describe actin-binding protein leiomodin acted strong filament nucleator muscle cells leiomodin shared two actin-binding sites filament pointed end-capping protein tropomodulin: flexible n-terminal region leucine-rich repeat domain leiomodin also contained c-terminal extension residues smallest fragment strong nucleation activity included leucine-rich repeat c-terminal extension n-terminal region enhanced nucleation activity threefold recruited tropomyosin weakly stimulated nucleation mediated localization leiomodin middle muscle sarcomeres knocking leiomodin severely compromised sarcomere assembly cultured muscle cells suggests role leiomodin nucleation tropomyosin-decorated filaments muscles
