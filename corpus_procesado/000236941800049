stability via asynchrony drosophila metapopulations low migration rates
experimental studies examined migration rate affects metapopulation dynamics stability studied dynamics replicate laboratory metapopulations drosophila different migration rates low migration stabilized metapopulation dynamics promoting unstable subpopulation dynamics inducing asynchrony among neighboring subpopulations high migration synchronized subpopulation dynamics thereby destabilizing meta populations contrary theoretical predictions increased migration affect average population size simulations based simple non-species-specific population growth model captured features data suggests results generalizable
