alternative zippering on-off switch snare-mediated fusion 
membrane fusion vesicles target membranes involves zippering four helix bundle generated constituent helices derived target vesicle soluble n-ethylmaleimide sensitive factor attachment protein receptors snares neurons protein complexin clamps otherwise spontaneous fusion snare proteins allowing neurotransmitters mediators secreted needed clamp released membrane proximal accessory helix complexin necessary clamping mechanism action unknown present experiments using reconstituted fusion system suggest simple model complexin accessory helix forms alternative four helix bundle target snare near membrane preventing vesicle snare completing zippering
