dynamic mechanical behavior multilayer graphene via supersonic projectile penetration 
multilayer graphene exceptional anisotropic material due layered structure composed two-dimensional carbon lattices although intrinsic mechanical properties graphene investigated quasi-static conditions behavior extreme dynamic conditions yet studied report high-strain-rate behavior multilayer graphene range thicknesses nanometers using miniaturized ballistic tests tensile stretching membrane cone shape followed initiation radial cracks approximately follow crystallographic directions extend outward well beyond impact area specific penetration energy multilayer graphene similar times literature values macroscopic steel sheets meters per second
