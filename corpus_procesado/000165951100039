stargazin regulates synaptic targeting ampa receptors two distinct mechanisms 
stargazer ataxic epileptic mutant mouse lacks functional ampa alpha amino--hydroxyl--methyl--isoxazolepropionate receptors cerebellar granule cells stargazin mutated protein interacts ampa receptor subunits synaptic pdz proteins psd- interaction stargazin ampa receptor subunits essential delivering functional receptors surface membrane granule cells whereas binding psd- related pdz proteins carboxy-terminal pdz-binding domain required targeting ampa receptor synapses expression mutant stargazin lacking pdz-binding domain hippocampal pyramidal cells disrupts synaptic ampa receptors indicating stargazin-like mechanisms targeting ampa receptors may widespread central nervous system
