frequency comb extreme ultraviolet
since interaction precision spectroscopy ultrafast laser science led several notable accomplishments femtosecond laser optical frequency combs evenly spaced spectral lines revolutionized measurement optical frequencies enabled optical atomic clocks comb techniques used control waveform ultrafast laser pulses permitted generation single attosecond pulses used recently demonstrated oscilloscope light waves demonstrate intra-cavity high harmonic generation extreme ultraviolet promises lead another joint frontier precision spectroscopy ultrafast science generated coherent extreme ultraviolet radiation repetition frequency mhz -fold improvement previous experiments repetition rate mode spacing frequency comb expected survive high harmonic generation process large enough high resolution spectroscopy additionally may many applications quasi-continuous compact coherent extreme ultraviolet source including extreme ultraviolet holography microscopy nanolithography x-ray atomic clocks
