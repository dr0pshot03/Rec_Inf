slow earthquakes preseismic velocity changes origin slow frictional stick-slip
earthquakes normally occur frictional stick-slip instabilities resulting catastrophic failure seismic rupture tectonic faults also fail slow earthquakes rupture durations months yet origin poorly understood present laboratory observations repetitive slow stick-slip serpentinite fault zones mechanical evidence origin document transition unstable stable frictional behavior increasing slip velocity providing mechanism limit speed slow earthquakes also document reduction p-wave speed within active shear zone stick-slip events similar mechanisms operate nature results suggest higher-resolution studies elastic properties tectonic fault zones may aid search reliable earthquake precursors
