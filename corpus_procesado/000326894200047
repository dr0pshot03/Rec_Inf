stabilizing magnetic moment single holmium atoms symmetry 
single magnetic atoms assemblies atoms nonmagnetic surfaces recently attracted attention owing potential use high-density magnetic data storage platform quantum computing- fundamental problem resulting quantum mechanical nature localized magnetic moments atoms easily destabilized interactions electrons nuclear spins lattice vibrations substrate- even large magnetic fields applied stabilize magnetic moment observed lifetimes remain rather short less microsecond several routes stabilizing magnetic moment fluctuations suggested using thin insulating layers magnetic atom substrate suppress interactions substrates conduction electrons coupling several magnetic moments together reduce quantum mechanical fluctuations show magnetic moments single holmium atoms highly conductive metallic substrate can reach lifetimes order minutes necessary decoupling thermal bath electrons nuclear spins lattice vibrations achieved remarkable combination several symmetries intrinsic system: time reversal symmetry internal symmetries total angular momentum point symmetry local environment magnetic atom
