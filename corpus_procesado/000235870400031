auxiliary subunits assist ampa-type glutamate receptors 
glutamate major excitatory neurotransmitter brain acts primarily two types ionotropic receptors: alpha-amino--hydroxy--methyl--isoxazolepropionic acid ampa receptors n-methyl-d-aspartate nmda receptors work past decade indicates regulated changes number synaptic ampa receptors may serve mechanism information storage recent studies demonstrate family small transmembrane ampa receptor regulatory proteins tarps controls ampa receptor trafficking channel gating tarps provide first example auxiliary subunits ionotropic receptors review pivotal role tarps play life cycle ampa receptors
