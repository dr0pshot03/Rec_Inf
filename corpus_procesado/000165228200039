role mg2+ impurity calcite growth
magnesium key determinant caco3 mineralization however macroscopic observations failed provide clear physical understanding magnesium modifies carbonate growth atomic force microscopy used resolve mechanism calcite inhibition magnesium molecular-scale determination thermodynamic kinetic controls magnesium calcite formation comparison directly measured step velocities standard impurity models demonstrated enhanced mineral solubility magnesium incorporation inhibited calcite growth terrace width measurements calcite growth spirals consistent decrease effective supersaturation due magnesium incorporation ca1-xmgxco3 solubilities determined microscopic observations step dynamics can thus linked macroscopic measurements
