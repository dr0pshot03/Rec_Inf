drosophila toll activated gram-positive bacteria circulating peptidoglycan recognition protein 
microbial infection activates two distinct intracellular signalling cascades immune-responsive fat body drosophila gram-positive bacteria fungi predominantly induce toll signalling pathway whereas gram-negative bacteria activate imd pathway loss-of-function mutants either pathway reduce resistance corresponding infections genetic screens identified range genes involved intracellular signalling cascades- activated microbial infection largely unknown activation transmembrane receptor toll requires proteolytically cleaved form extracellular cytokine-like polypeptide spatzle suggesting toll function bona fide recognition receptor microbial patterns apparent contrast mammalian toll-like receptors raises question host molecules actually recognize microbial patterns activate toll spatzle present mutation blocks toll activation gram-positive bacteria significantly decreases resistance type infection mutation semmelweis seml inactivates gene encoding peptidoglycan recognition protein pgrp-sa interestingly seml affect toll activation fungal infection indicating existence distinct recognition system fungi activate toll pathway
