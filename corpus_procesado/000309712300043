pitted terrain vesta implications presence volatiles 
investigated origin unusual pitted terrain asteroid vesta revealed images dawn spacecraft pitted terrain characterized irregular rimless depressions found around several impact craters distinct morphology observed airless bodies similar terrain associated numerous martian craters pits thought form degassing volatile-bearing material heated impact pitted terrain vesta may formed similar manner indicates portions surface contain relatively large volatile component exogenic materials water-rich carbonaceous chondrites may source volatiles suggesting impactor materials preserved locally relatively high abundance vesta impactor composition played important role shaping asteroids geology
