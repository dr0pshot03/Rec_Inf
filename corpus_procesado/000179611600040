non-framework cation migration irreversible pressure-induced hydration zeolite 
zeolites crystallize variety three-dimensional structures oxygen atoms shared tetrahedra containing silicon and/or aluminium thus yielding negatively charged tetrahedral frameworks enclose cavities pores molecular dimensions occupied charge-balancing metal cations water molecules cation migration pores changes water content associated concomitant relaxation framework observed numerous variable-temperature studies- whereas effects hydrostatic pressure structure properties zeolites less well explored- zeolite sodium aluminosilicate natrolite recently shown undergo volume expansion pressures gpa result reversible pressure-induced hydration contrast synthetic analogue potassium gallosilicate natrolite exhibited irreversible pressure-induced hydration retention high-pressure phase ambient conditions report structure high-pressure recovered phase contrast high-pressure phase sodium aluminosilicate natrolite findings show irreversible hydration behaviour associated pronounced rearrangement non-framework metal ions thus emphasizing can clearly important role mediating overall properties zeolites
