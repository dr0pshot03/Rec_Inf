emergent reduction electronic state dimensionality dense ordered li-be alloys 
high pressure known influence electronic structure crystal packing can cases even induce compound formation elements bond ambient conditions- present computational study showing high pressure fundamentally alters reactivity light elements lithium li beryllium first metals condensed state immiscible normal conditions identify four stoichiometric lixbe1-x compounds stable range pressures find electronic density states one displays remarkable step-like feature near bottom valence band remains almost constant increasing energy characteristics typical quasi two dimensional electronic structure emergence three dimensional environment rather unexpected attribute observation large size differences ionic cores li be: density increases li cores start overlap thereby expel valence electrons quasi two dimensional layers characterized delocalized free particle like states vicinity ions
