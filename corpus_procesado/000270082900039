population context determines cell-to-cell variability endocytosis virus infection
single-cell heterogeneity cell populations arises combination intrinsic extrinsic factors- heterogeneity measured gene transcription phosphorylation cell morphology drug perturbations used explain various aspects cellular physiology- cases however causes heterogeneity studied analyse first time heterogeneous patterns related cellular activities namely virus infection endocytosis membrane lipid composition adherent human cells reveal correlations specific cellular states defined population context cell derive probabilistic models can explain predict cellular heterogeneity activities solely basis cells population context find accounting population-determined heterogeneity essential interpreting differences activity levels cell populations finally reveal synergy two molecular components focal adhesion kinase sphingolipid gm1 enhances population-determined pattern simian virus sv40 infection findings provide explanation origin heterogeneity patterns cellular activities adherent cell populations
