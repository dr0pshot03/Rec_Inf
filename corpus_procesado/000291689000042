ampk direct adenylate charge-regulated protein kinase 
adenosine monophosphate amp-activated protein kinase ampk regulates whole-body cellular energy balance response energy demand supply ampk alpha beta gamma heterotrimer activated decreasing concentrations adenosine triphosphate atp increasing amp concentrations ampk activation depends phosphorylation alpha catalytic subunit threonine thr kinases lkb1 camkk beta promoted amp binding gamma subunit amp sustains activity inhibiting dephosphorylation alpha-thr whereas atp promotes dephosphorylation adenosine diphosphate adp like amp bound gamma sites stimulated alpha-thr phosphorylation however contrast amp adp directly activate phosphorylated ampk way adp/atp amp/atp ratios contribute ampk regulation
