eocene/oligocene ocean de-acidification linked antarctic glaciation sea-level fall 
one dramatic perturbations earth system past million years rapid onset antarctic glaciation near eocene/ oligocene epoch boundary- similar million years ago climate transition accompanied deepening calcite compensation depth ocean depth rate calcium carbonate input surface waters equals rate dissolution changes global carbon cycle rather changes continental configuration recently proposed likely root cause antarctic glaciation mechanism linking glaciation deepening calcite compensation depth remains unclear use global biogeochemical box model test competing hypotheses put forward explain eocene/ oligocene transition find candidate hypotheses shelf deep sea carbonate partitioning capable explaining observed changes carbon isotope composition calcium carbonate accumulation sea floor simulations glacioeustatic sea level fall associated growth antarctic ice sheets permanently reduces global calcium carbonate accumulation continental shelves leading increase pelagic burial via permanent deepening calcite compensation depth time fresh limestones exposed erosion thus temporarily increasing global river inputs dissolved carbonate increasing seawater delta c work sheds new light mechanisms linking glaciation ocean acidity change across arguably important climate transition cenozoic era
