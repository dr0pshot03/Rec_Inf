circadian control chloroplast transcription nuclear-encoded timing signal 
circadian timekeeping plants increases photosynthesis productivity circadian oscillations abundance many chloroplast-encoded transcripts known circadian clock regulates chloroplast transcription photosynthetic apparatus show arabidopsis nuclear-encoded sigma factor5 sig5 controls circadian rhythms transcription several chloroplast genes revealing one pathway nuclear-encoded circadian oscillator controls rhythms chloroplast gene expression also show sig5 mediates circadian gating light input chloroplast-encoded gene identified evolutionarily conserved mechanism communicates circadian timing information organelles distinct genetic systems established new level integration eukaryotic circadian clocks organelles endosymbiotic origin
