single-atom quantum memory
faithful storage quantum bit qubit light essential long-distance quantum communication quantum networking distributed quantum computing required optical quantum memory must able receive recreate photonic qubit additionally must store unknown quantum state light better classical device far two requirements met ensembles material particles store information collective excitations- recent developments however paved way approach information exchange occurs single quanta light matter- single-particle approach allows material qubit addressed fundamental advantages realistic implementations first enables heralding mechanism signals successful storage photon means state detection- can used combat inevitable losses finite efficiencies second allows individual qubit manipulations opening avenues situ processing stored quantum information demonstrate fundamental implementation quantum memory mapping arbitrary polarization states light single atom trapped inside optical cavity memory performance tested weak coherent pulses analysed using full quantum process tomography average fidelity measured % low decoherence rates result qubit coherence times exceeding microseconds makes system versatile quantum node excellent prospects applications optical quantum gates quantum repeaters
