torque-generating units flagellar motor escherichia coli high duty ratio
rotation bacterial flagellar motor driven ensemble torque-generating units containing proteins mota motb- inducing expression mota mota- cells conditions low viscous load show limiting speed motor independent number units: vanishing load one unit turns motor rapidly many result indicates unit may remain attached rotor mechanochemical cycle high duty ratio thus torque generators behave like kinesin protein moves vesicles along microtubules myosin protein powers muscle however translation rates stepping frequencies power outputs much higher greater mu m s- hz x pn nm s- respectively
