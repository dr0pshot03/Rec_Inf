delta-wing function webbed feet gives hydrodynamic lift swimming propulsion birds 
foot-propelled swimming birds sweep webbed feet backwards curved path lies plane aligned swimming direction foot passes outward position near beginning power stroke tangent foot trajectory parallel line swimming foot web perpendicular later stroke foot takes increasingly transverse direction swinging towards longitudinal axis body show early power stroke propulsion achieved mostly hydrodynamic drag foot whereas gradual transition lift-based propulsion later stroke shift lift mode attached vortices drag-based phase turn starting vortex shed trailing edge spiralling leading-edge vortices along sides foot delta shape webbed feet can generate propulsive forces continuously two successive modes drag beginning stroke way transition predominantly lift later stroke
