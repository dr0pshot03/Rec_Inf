postsynaptic induction bdnf-mediated long-term potentiation
brain-derived neurotrophic factor bdnf neurotrophins critically involved long-term potentiation ltp previous reports point presynaptic site neurotrophin action imaging dentate granule cells mouse hippocampal slices identified bdnf-evoked ca2+ transients dendrites spines presynaptic sites pairing weak burst synaptic stimulation brief dendritic bdnf application caused immediate robust induction ltp ltp induction required activation postsynaptic ca2+ channels n-methyl-d-aspartate receptors prevented blockage postsynaptic call transients thus results suggest bdnf-mediated ltp induced postsynaptically finding dendritic spines exclusive synaptic sites rapid bdnf-evoked ca2+ signaling supports conclusion
