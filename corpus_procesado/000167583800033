observation high-energy neutrinos using cerenkov detectors embedded deep antarctic ice 
neutrinos elementary particles carry electric charge little mass interact weakly particles can penetrate enormous amounts matter therefore potential directly convey astrophysical information edge universe deep inside cataclysmic high-energy regions neutrinos great penetrating power however also makes particle difficult detect underground detectors observed low-energy neutrinos sun nearby supernova well neutrinos generated earths atmosphere low fluxes high-energy neutrinos cosmic sources can observed much larger expandable detectors example deep water ice report detection upwardly propagating atmospheric neutrinos ice-based antarctic muon neutrino detector array amanda results establish technology build kilometre-scale neutrino observatory necessary astrophysical observations
