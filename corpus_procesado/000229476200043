highly efficient endogenous human gene correction using designed zinc-finger nucleases
permanent modification human genome vivo impractical owing low frequency homologous recombination human cells fact hampers biomedical research progress towards safe effective gene therapy report general solution using two fundamental biological processes: dna recognition c2h2 zinc-finger proteins homology-directed repair dna double-strand breaks zinc-finger proteins engineered recognize unique chromosomal site can fused nuclease domain double-strand break induced resulting zinc-finger nuclease can create specific sequence alterations stimulating homologous recombination chromosome extrachromosomal dna donor show zinc-finger nucleases designed x-linked severe combined immune deficiency scid mutation il2r gamma gene yielded % gene-modified human cells without selection remarkably % cells acquired desired genetic modification x chromosomes cell genotype accurately reflected messenger rna protein levels observe comparably high frequencies human t cells raising possibility strategies based zinc-finger nucleases treatment disease
