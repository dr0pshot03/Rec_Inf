physical structure inversion charge semiconductor interface crystalline oxide 
show physical electrical structure hence inversion charge crystalline oxides semiconductors can understood systematically manipulated atomic level heterojunction band offset alignment adjusted atomic-level structural chemical changes resulting demonstration electrical interface polar oxide semiconductor free interface charge broader sense take metal oxide semiconductor device new prominent position solid-state electronics timeline can now extensively developed using entirely new physical system: crystalline oxides-on-semiconductors interface
