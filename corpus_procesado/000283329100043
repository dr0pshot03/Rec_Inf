snp genotyping defines complex gene-flow boundaries among african malaria vector mosquitoes 
mosquitoes anopheles gambiae complex show rapid ecological behavioral diversification traits promote malaria transmission complicate vector control efforts high-density genome-wide mosquito snp-genotyping array allowed mapping genomic differentiation populations species exhibit varying levels reproductive isolation regions near centromeres within polymorphic inversions exhibited greatest genetic divergence divergence also observed elsewhere genomes signals natural selection within populations overrepresented among genomic regions differentiated populations implying differentiation often driven population-specific selective events complex genomic differentiation among speciating vector mosquito populations implies tools genome-wide monitoring population structure will prove useful advancement malaria eradication
