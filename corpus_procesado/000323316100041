structural basis molecular recognition folic acid folate receptors
folate receptors fr alpha fr beta fr gamma cysteine-rich cell-surface glycoproteins bind folate high affinity mediate cellular uptake folate although expressed low levels tissues folate receptors especially fr alpha expressed high levels numerous cancers meet folate demand rapidly dividing cells low folate conditions- folate dependency many tumours therapeutically diagnostically exploited administration anti-fr alpha antibodies high-affinity antifolates folate-based imaging agents folate-conjugated drugs toxins- understand folate binds receptors determined crystal structure human fr alpha complex folic acid angstrom resolution fr alpha globular structure stabilized eight disulphide bonds contains deep open folate-binding pocket comprised residues conserved receptor subtypes folate pteroate moiety buried inside receptor whereas glutamate moiety solvent-exposed sticks pocket entrance allowing conjugated drugs without adversely affecting fr alpha binding extensive interactions receptor ligand readily explain high folate-binding affinity folate receptors provide template designing specific drugs targeting folate receptor system
