caffeine floral nectar enhances pollinators memory reward
plant defense compounds occur floral nectar ecological role well understood provide evidence plant compounds pharmacologically alter pollinator behavior enhancing memory reward honeybees rewarded caffeine occurs naturally nectar coffea citrus species three times likely remember learned floral scent honeybees rewarded sucrose alone caffeine potentiated responses mushroom body neurons involved olfactory learning memory acting adenosine receptor antagonist caffeine concentrations nectar exceed bees bitter taste threshold implying pollinators impose selection nectar pharmacologically active repellent using drug enhance memories reward plants secure pollinator fidelity improve reproductive success
