measurement conductance hydrogen molecule 
recent years shown steady progress towards molecular electronics molecules form basic components switches- diodes electronic mixers often scanning tunnelling microscope used address individual molecule although arrangement provide long-term stability therefore metal-molecule-metal links using break-junction devices- also explored however difficult establish unambiguously single molecule forms contact show single hydrogen molecule can form stable bridge platinum electrodes contrast results organic molecules bridge nearly perfect conductance one quantum unit carried single channel hydrogen bridge represents simple test system understand fundamental transport properties single-molecule devices
