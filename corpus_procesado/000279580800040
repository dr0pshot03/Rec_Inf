conserved role intragenic dna methylation regulating alternative promoters 
although known methylation dna promoters suppresses gene expression role dna methylation gene bodies unclear- mammals tissue-and cell type-specific methylation present small percentage cpg island cgi promoters whereas far greater proportion occurs across gene bodies coinciding highly conserved sequences- tissue-specific intragenic methylation might reduce paradoxically enhance transcription elongation efficiency capped analysis gene expression cage experiments also indicate transcription commonly initiates within genes- investigate role intragenic methylation generated map dna methylation human brain encompassing million million cpg sites dense high-resolution coverage cpg islands majority methylated cpg islands shown intragenic intergenic regions whereas less % cpg islands promoters methylated cpg islands three locations overlapped rna markers transcription initiation unmethylated cpg islands also overlapped significantly trimethylation h3k4 histone modification enriched promoters general cpg-island-specific patterns methylation conserved mouse tissues in-depth investigation human shank3 locus mouse homologue demonstrated tissue-specific dna methylation regulates intragenic promoter activity vitro vivo methylation-regulated alternative transcripts expressed tissue-and cell type-specific manner expressed differentially within single cell type distinct brain regions results support major role intragenic methylation regulating cell context-specific alternative promoters gene bodies
