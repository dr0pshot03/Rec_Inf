distance parsecs pleiades star cluster
nearby open clusters stars gravitationally bound played crucial role development stellar astronomy consequence stars common age provide excellent natural laboratories test theoretical stellar models clusters also play fundamental part determining distance scales satellite hipparcos surprisingly found extensively studied open cluster pleiades also known seven sisters distance d +/ pc refs ten per cent smaller accepted value- discrepancy generated spirited debate implication either current stellar models incorrect surprising amount hipparcos giving incorrect distances report orbital parameters bright double star atlas pleiades using long baseline optical/ infrared interferometry data derive firm lower bound d > pc likely range < d < pc result reaffirms fidelity current stellar models
