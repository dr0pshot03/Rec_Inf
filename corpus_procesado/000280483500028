tissue-engineered lungs vivo implantation
adult lung tissue limited regeneration capacity lung transplantation primary therapy severely damaged lungs explore whether lung tissue can regenerated vitro treated lungs adult rats using procedure removes cellular components leaves behind scaffold extracellular matrix retains hierarchical branching structures airways vasculature used bioreactor culture pulmonary epithelium vascular endothelium acellular lung matrix seeded epithelium displayed remarkable hierarchical organization within matrix seeded endothelial cells efficiently repopulated vascular compartment vitro mechanical characteristics engineered lungs similar native lung tissue implanted rats vivo short time intervals minutes engineered lungs participated gas exchange although representing initial step toward ultimate goal generating fully functional lungs vitro results suggest repopulation lung matrix viable strategy lung regeneration
