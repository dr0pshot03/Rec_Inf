"water-in-salt" electrolyte enables high-voltage aqueous lithium-ion chemistries 
lithium-ion batteries raise safety environmental cost concerns mostly arise nonaqueous electrolytes use aqueous alternatives limited narrow electrochemical stability window volts sets intrinsic limit practical voltage energy output report highly concentrated aqueous electrolyte whose window expanded similar volts formation electrode-electrolyte interphase full lithium-ion battery volts using aqueous electrolyte demonstrated cycle times nearly % coulombic efficiency low coulomb high coulombs discharge charge rates
