dynamic stark control photochemical processes 
method presented controlling outcome photochemical reactions using dynamic stark effect due strong nonresonant infrared field application precisely timed infrared laser pulse reversibly modifies potential energy barriers chemical reaction without inducing real electronic transitions dynamic stark control dsc experimentally demonstrated nonadiabatic photochemical reaction showing substantial modification reaction channel probabilities dissociation ibr dsc process nonperturbative insensitive laser frequency affects polarizable molecules suggesting broad applicability
