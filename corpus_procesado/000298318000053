dna-binding factors shape mouse methylome distal regulatory regions
methylation cytosines essential epigenetic modification mammalian genomes yet rules govern methylation patterns remain largely elusive gain insights process generated base-pair-resolution mouse methylomes stem cells neuronal progenitors advanced quantitative analysis identified low-methylated regions lmrs average methylation % represent cpg-poor distal regulatory regions evidenced location dnase hypersensitivity presence enhancer chromatin marks enhancer activity reporter assays lmrs occupied dna-binding factors binding necessary sufficient create lmrs comparison neuronal stem-cell methylomes confirms dependency cell-type-specific lmrs occupied cell-type-specific transcription factors study provides methylome references mouse shows dna-binding factors locally influence dna methylation enabling identification active regulatory regions
