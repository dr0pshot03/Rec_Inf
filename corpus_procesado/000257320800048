large rapid melt-induced velocity changes ablation zone greenland ice sheet 
continuous global positioning system observations reveal rapid large ice velocity fluctuations western ablation zone greenland ice sheet within days ice velocity reacts increased meltwater production increases factor response much stronger much faster previously reported longer period years annual ice velocities decreased slightly suggests englacial hydraulic system adjusts constantly variable meltwater input results less constant ice flux years positive feedback mechanism melt rate ice velocity appears seasonal process may limited effect response ice sheet climate warming next decades
