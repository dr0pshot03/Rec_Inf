probing structure metal cluster-adsorbate systems high-resolution infrared spectroscopy
high-resolution infrared laser spectroscopy used obtain rotationally resolved infrared spectra adsorbate-metal complexes method involves forming bare metal clusters helium nanodroplets adding molecular adsorbate hcn recording infrared spectrum associated c-h stretching vibration rotationally resolved spectra obtained mcn-mg-n n results suggest qualitative change adsorbate-metal cluster bonding cluster size
