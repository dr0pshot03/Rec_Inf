abscisic acid receptor pyr1 complex abscisic acid 
plant hormone abscisic acid aba central role coordinating adaptive response situations decreased water availability well regulation plant growth development recently -member family intracellular aba receptors named pyr/pyl/rcar1- identified proteins inhibit aba-dependent manner activity family key negative regulators aba signalling pathway: group-a protein phosphatases type 2c pp2cs4- present crystal structure arabidopsis thaliana pyr1 consists dimer one subunits bound aba ligand-bound subunit loops surrounding entry binding cavity fold aba molecule enclosing inside whereas empty subunit form channel leaving open access cavity indicating conformational changes loops critical role stabilization hormone-receptor complex providing structural details aba-binding pocket work paves way development new small molecules able activate plant stress response
