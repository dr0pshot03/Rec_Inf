degradation micrornas family exoribonucleases arabidopsis 
micrornas mirnas play crucial roles numerous developmental metabolic processes plants animals steady state levels mirnas need properly controlled ensure normal development whereas framework mirna biogenesis established factors involved mirna degradation remain unknown show family exoribonucleases encoded small rna degrading nuclease sdn genes degrades mature mirnas arabidopsis sdn1 acts specifically single stranded mirnas vitro sensitive -o-methyl modification terminal ribose mirnas simultaneous knockdown three sdn genes vivo results elevated mirna levels pleiotropic developmental defects therefore uncovered enzymes degrade mirnas demonstrated mirna turnover crucial plant development
