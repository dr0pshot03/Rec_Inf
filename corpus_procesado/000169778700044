discovery water vapour around irc+ evidence comets orbiting another star
since planets masses comparable jupiter discovered around approximately stars planets seen directly presence inferred small reflex motions gravitationally induce star orbit motions result small periodic wavelength shifts stellar spectrum presence analogues smaller bodies solar system however determined using technique induced reflex motions small-so alternative approach needed report observation circumstellar water vapour around ageing carbon star irc+ water expected measurable quantities around star plausible explanation water recent evolution irc+ accompanied prodigious increase luminosity causing vaporization collection orbiting icy bodies-a process considered earlier theoretical study
