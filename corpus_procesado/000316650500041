genomic signature dog domestication reveals adaptation starch-rich diet 
domestication dogs important episode development human civilization precise timing location event debated- little known genetic changes accompanied transformation ancient wolves domestic dogs conduct whole-genome resequencimg dogs wolves identify million genetic variants used identify genomic regions probably represent targets selection dog domestication nineteen regions contain genes important brain function eight belong nervous system development pathways potentially underlie behavioural changes central dog domestication ten genes key roles starch digestion fat metabolism also show signals selection identify candidate mutations key genes provide functional support increased starch digestion dogs relative wolves results indicate novel adaptations allowing early ancestors modern dogs thrive diet rich starch relative carnivorous diet wolves constituted crucial step early domestication dogs
