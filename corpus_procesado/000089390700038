accelerations stars orbiting milky ways central black hole
recent measurements- velocities stars near centre milky way provided strongest evidence presence supermassive black hole galaxy observational uncertainties poorly constrain many black holes properties determining accelerations stars orbits around centre provides much precise information position mass black hole report measurements accelerations three stars located similar pc projected sky central radio source sagittarius astar sgr astar accelerations comparable experienced earth orbits sun data increase inferred minimum mass density central region galaxy order magnitude relative previous results localize dark mass within +/ arcsec nominal position sgr astar addition orbital period one observed stars short years allowing us opportunity near future observe entire period
