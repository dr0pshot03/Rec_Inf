central cell-derived peptides regulate early embryo patterning flowering plants
plant embryogenesis initiates establishment apical-basal axis however molecular mechanisms accompanying early event remain unclear show small cysteine-rich peptide family required formation zygotic basal cell lineage proembryo patterning arabidopsis embryo surrounding factor esf1 peptides accumulate fertilization central cell gametes thereafter embryo-surrounding endosperm cells biochemical structural analyses revealed cleavage esf1 propeptides form biologically active mature peptides peptides act non-cell-autonomous manner synergistically receptor-like kinase short suspensor promote suspensor elongation yoda mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway findings demonstrate second female gamete sexually derived endosperm regulate early embryonic patterning flowering plants
