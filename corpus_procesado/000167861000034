alignment liquid crystals patterned isotropic surfaces
molecules nematic liquid crystal exposed isotropic surface adopt mean tilt relative normal in-plane alignment-that free azimuthal orientation surface plane pursuing theoretical suggestion meyer spite azimuthal degeneracy spatially inhomogeneous isotropic surfaces combine liquid crystal elastic anisotropy produce alignment show boundary line two isotropic regions differ mean tilt indeed align liquid crystal boundaries patterned surface distinct isotropic regions thus act system lines molecular orientation locally follows enables development liquid crystal alignment surfaces based printing lithographic patterning
