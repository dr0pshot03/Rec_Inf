cytoplasmic dynein moves uncoordinated stepping aaa plus ring domains 
cytoplasmic dynein homodimeric aaa+ motor transports multitude cargos toward microtubule minus end two catalytic head domains interact move relative processive movement unclear tracked relative positions heads nanometer precision directly observed heads moving independently along microtubule heads remained widely separated stepping behavior varied function interhead separation one active head sufficient processive movement active head drag inactive partner head forward thus dynein moves processively without interhead coordination mechanism fundamentally distinct hand-over-hand stepping kinesin myosin
