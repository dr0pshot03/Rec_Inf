reaction discovery enabled dna-templated synthesis vitro selection 
current approaches reaction discovery focus one particular transformation typically researchers choose substrates based predicted ability serve precursors target structure evaluate reaction conditions1- ability effect product formation approach ideal addressing specific reactivity problems focused nature might leave many areas chemical reactivity unexplored report reaction discovery approach uses dna-templated organic synthesis7- vitro selection simultaneously evaluate many combinations different substrates bond-forming reactions single solution watson crick base pairing controls effective molarities substrates tethered dna strands; bond-forming substrate combinations revealed using vitro selection bond formation pcr amplification dna microarray analysis using approach discovered efficient mild carbon carbon bond-forming reaction generates enone alkyne alkene using inorganic palladium catalyst although approach restricted conditions catalysts least partially compatible dna expect versatility efficiency will enable discovery additional reactions wide range substrates
