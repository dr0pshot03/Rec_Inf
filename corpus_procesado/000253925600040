shotgun bisulphite sequencing arabidopsis genome reveals dna methylation patterning 
cytosine dna methylation important regulating gene expression silencing transposons repetitive sequences12 recent genomic studies arabidopsis thaliana revealed many endogenous genes methylated either within promoters within transcribed regions gene methylation highly correlated transcription levels3- however plants different types methylation controlled different genetic pathways detailed information methylation status cytosine given genome lacking end generated map single base pair resolution methylated cytosines arabidopsis combining bisulphite treatment genomic dna ultra high throughput sequencing using illumina 1g genome analyser solexa sequencing technology6 approach termed bs seq unlike previous microarray based methods allows one sensitively measure cytosine methylation genome wide scale within specific sequence contexts describe methylation previously inaccessible components genome analyse dna methylation sequence composition distribution also describe effect various dna methylation mutants genome wide methylation patterns demonstrate newly developed library construction computational methods can applied large genomes mouse
