genome sequence palaeopolyploid soybean
soybean glycine max one important crop plants seed protein oil content capacity fix atmospheric nitrogen symbioses soil-borne microorganisms sequenced -gigabase genome whole-genome shotgun approach integrated physical high-density genetic maps create chromosome-scale draft sequence assembly predict protein-coding genes % arabidopsis similar poplar genome like soybean ancient polyploid palaeopolyploid % predicted genes occur chromosome ends comprise less one-half genome account nearly genetic recombination genome duplications occurred approximately million years ago resulting highly duplicated genome nearly % genes present multiple copies two duplication events followed gene diversification loss numerous chromosome rearrangements accurate soybean genome sequence will facilitate identification genetic basis many soybean traits accelerate creation improved soybean varieties
