astrocytes potentiate transmitter release single hippocampal synapses 
astrocytes play active roles brain physiology respond neurotransmitters modulate neuronal excitability synaptic function however influence astrocytes synaptic transmission plasticity single synapse level unknown ca2+ elevation astrocytes transiently increased probability transmitter release hippocampal area ca3-ca1 synapses without affecting amplitude synaptic events form short-term plasticity due release glutamate astrocytes process depended ca2+ soluble n-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor snare protein activated metabotropic glutamate receptors mglurs transient potentiation transmitter release became persistent astrocytic signal temporally coincident postsynaptic depolarization persistent plasticity mglur-mediated n-methyl-d-aspartate receptorin-dependent results indicate astrocytes actively involved transfer storage synaptic information
