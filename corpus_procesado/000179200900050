heteromeric cyclic nucleotide gated channel adopts 3a : 1b stoichiometry
cyclic nucleotide-gated cng channels crucial visual olfactory transductions- channels tetramers native forms composed b subunits stoichiometry thought 2a:2b refs report identification leucine-zipper-homology domain named clz carboxy-terminal leucine zipper domain present distal c terminus cng channel subunits absent b subunits mediates inter-subunit interaction cross-linking non-denaturing gel electrophoresis analytical centrifugation clz domain found mediate trimeric interaction addition mutant cone cng channel subunit clz domain replaced generic trimeric leucine zipper produced channels behaved much like wild type less replaced dimeric tetrameric leucine zipper a-subunit-only trimeric interaction suggests heteromeric cng channels actually adopt 3a:1b stoichiometry biochemical analysis purified bovine rod cng channel confirmed conclusion revised stoichiometry provides new foundation understanding structure function cng channel family
