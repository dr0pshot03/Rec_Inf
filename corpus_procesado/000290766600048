structures bacterial ribosome classical hybrid states trna binding 
protein synthesis ribosome controls movement trna mrna means large-scale structural rearrangements describe structures intact bacterial ribosome escherichia coli reveal ribosome binds trna two functionally distinct states determined resolution similar angstroms means x-ray crystallography one state positions trna peptidyl-trna binding site second fully rotated state stabilized ribosome recycling factor binds trna highly bent conformation hybrid peptidyl/exit site structures help explain ratchet-like motion two ribosomal subunits contributes mechanisms translocation termination ribosome recycling
