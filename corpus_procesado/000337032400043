targeted genome editing human repopulating haematopoietic stem cells 
targeted genome editing artificial nucleases brought goal site-specific transgene integration gene correction within reach gene therapy however application long-term repopulating haematopoietic stem cells hscs remained elusive show poor permissiveness gene transfer limited proficiency homology-directed dna repair pathway constrain gene targeting human hscs tailoring delivery platforms culture conditions overcame barriers provide stringent evidence targeted integration human hscs long-term multilineage repopulation transplanted mice demonstrate therapeutic potential strategy targeting corrective complementary dna il2rg gene hscs healthy donors subject x-linked severe combined immunodeficiency scid-x1 gene-edited hscs sustained normal haematopoiesis gave rise functional lymphoid cells possess selective growth advantage carrying disruptive il2rg mutations results open new avenues treating scid-x1 diseases
