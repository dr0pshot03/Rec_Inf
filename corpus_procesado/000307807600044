assembly evolutionarily new pathway alpha-pyrone biosynthesis arabidopsis
plants possess arrays functionally diverse specialized metabolites many distributed taxonomically describe evolution class substituted alpha-pyrone metabolites arabidopsis named arabidopyrones biosynthesis arabidopyrones requires cytochrome p450 enzyme cyp84a4 generate catechol-substituted substrate extradiol ring-cleavage dioxygenase atligb unlike ring-cleavage-derived plant metabolites made tyrosine arabidopyrones instead derived phenylalanine early steps phenylpropanoid metabolism whereas cyp84a4 arabidopsis-specific paralog lignin-biosynthetic enzyme cyp84a1 neofunctionalized relative ancestor atligb homologs widespread among land plants many bacteria study exemplifies rapid evolution biochemical pathway formed addition new biological activity existing metabolic infrastructure
