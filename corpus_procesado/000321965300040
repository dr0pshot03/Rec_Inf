enhanced remote earthquake triggering fluid-injection sites midwestern united states
recent dramatic increase seismicity midwestern united states may related increases deep wastewater injection demonstrate areas suspected anthropogenic earthquakes also susceptible earthquake-triggering natural transient stresses generated seismic waves large remote earthquakes enhanced triggering susceptibility suggests presence critically loaded faults potentially high fluid pressures sensitivity remote triggering clearly seen sites long delay start injection onset seismicity regions went host moderate magnitude earthquakes within months triggering induced seismic zones therefore indicator fluid injection brought fault system critical state
