robustness compensation information transmission signaling pathways
robust transmission information despite presence variation fundamental problem cellular functions however capability characteristics information transmission signaling pathways remain poorly understood describe robustness compensation information transmission signaling pathways cell population level calculated mutual information transmitted signaling pathways growth factor-mediated gene expression growth factors appeared carry information sufficient binary decision information transmission generally robust average signal intensity despite pharmacological perturbations compensation information transmission occurred information transmission biological output neurite extension appeared robust cells may use information entropy information messages can robustly transmitted despite variation molecular activities among individual cells
