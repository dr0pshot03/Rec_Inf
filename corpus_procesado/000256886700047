phylogeny-aware gap placement prevents errors sequence alignment evolutionary analysis 
genetic sequence alignment basis many evolutionary comparative studies errors alignments lead errors interpretation evolutionary information genomes traditional multiple sequence alignment methods disregard phylogenetic implications gap patterns create infer systematically biased alignments excess deletions substitutions insertions implausible insertion-deletion event histories present method prevents systematic errors recognizing insertions deletions distinct evolutionary events show theoretically practically improves quality sequence alignments downstream analyses wide range realistic alignment problems results suggest insertions sequence turnover common currently thought challenge conventional picture sequence evolution mechanisms functional structural changes
