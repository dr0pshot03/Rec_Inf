archaeopteryx-like theropod china origin avialae 
archaeopteryx widely accepted basal bird accordingly regarded central understanding avialan origins; however recent discoveries derived maniraptorans weakened avialan status archaeopteryx report new archaeopteryx-like theropod china find demonstrates many features formerly regarded diagnostic avialae including long robust forelimbs actually characterize inclusive group paraves composed avialans deinonychosaurs notably adding new taxon comprehensive phylogenetic analysis shifts archaeopteryx deinonychosauria despite tentative statistical support result challenges centrality archaeopteryx transition birds new phylogenetic hypothesis can confirmed investigation current assumptions regarding avialan ancestral condition will need re-evaluated
