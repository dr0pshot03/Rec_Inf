oxytocin selectively gates fear responses distinct outputs central amygdala
central amygdala cea projections hypothalamic brain stem nuclei regulate behavioral physiological expression fear unknown whether different aspects fear response can separately regulated cea combined fluorescent retrograde tracing cea projections nuclei modulate fear-related freezing cardiovascular responses vitro electrophysiological recordings vivo monitoring related behavioral physiological parameters cea projections emerged separate neuronal populations different electrophysiological characteristics different response properties oxytocin vivo oxytocin decreased freezing responses fear-conditioned rats without affecting cardiovascular response thus neuropeptidergic signaling can modulate cea outputs separate neuronal circuits thereby individually steer various aspects fear response
