hippocampal place-cell sequences depict future paths remembered goals
effective navigation requires planning extended routes remembered goal locations hippocampal place cells proposed role navigational planning direct evidence lacking show goal-directed navigation open arena rat hippocampus generates brief sequences encoding spatial trajectories strongly biased progress subjects current location known goal location sequences predict immediate future behaviour even cases specific combination start goal locations novel results indicate hippocampal sequence events characterized previously linearly constrained environments replay also capable supporting goal-directed trajectory-finding mechanism identifies important places relevant behavioural paths specific times memory retrieval required manner used control subsequent navigational behaviour
