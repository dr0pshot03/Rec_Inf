global genetic change tracks global climate warming drosophila subobscura
comparisons recent historical samples chromosome inversion frequencies provide opportunities determine whether genetic change tracking climate change natural populations determined magnitude direction shifts time years samples average chromosome inversion frequencies ambient temperature populations fly drosophila subobscura three continents populations climates warmed intervals genotypes characteristic low latitudes warm climates increased frequency populations thus genetic change fly tracking climate warming globally
