quantum register based individual electronic nuclear spin qubits diamond 
key challenge experimental quantum information science identify isolated quantum mechanical systems long coherence times can manipulated coupled together scalable fashion describe coherent manipulation individual electron spin nearby individual nuclear spins create controllable quantum register using optical microwave radiation control electron spin associated nitrogen vacancy nv color center diamond demonstrated robust initialization electron nuclear spin quantum bits qubits transfer arbitrary quantum states room temperature moreover nuclear spin qubits well isolated electron spin even optical polarization measurement electronic state finally coherent interactions individual nuclear spin qubits observed excellent coherence properties demonstrated registers can used basis scalable optically coupled quantum information systems
