direct quantitative measure surface mobility glassy polymer
thin polymer films striking dynamical properties differ bulk counterparts simple geometry stepped polymer film substrate probe mobility glass transition temperature t-g t-g entire film flows whereas t-g near-surface region responds excess interfacial energy analytical thin-film model flow limited free surface region shows excellent agreement sub-t-g data system transitions whole-film flow surface localized flow narrow temperature region near bulk t-g experiments model provide measure surface mobility simple geometry confinement substrate effects negligible fine control glassy rheology key interest nanolithography among numerous applications
