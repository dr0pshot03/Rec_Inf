geophysical imaging reveals topographic stress control bedrock weathering
bedrock fracture systems facilitate weathering allowing fresh mineral surfaces interact corrosive waters biota earths surface simultaneously promoting drainage chemically equilibrated fluids show topographic perturbations regional stress fields explain bedrock fracture distributions revealed seismic velocity electrical resistivity surveys three landscapes base fracture-rich zone mirrors surface topography ratio horizontal compressive tectonic stresses near-surface gravitational stresses relatively large parallels surface topography ratio relatively small three-dimensional stress calculations predict results suggesting tectonic stresses interact topography influence bedrock disaggregation groundwater flow chemical weathering depth critical zone many biogeochemical processes occur
