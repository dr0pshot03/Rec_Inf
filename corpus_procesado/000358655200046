parent stem cells can serve niches daughter cells 
stem cells integrate inputs multiple sources stem cell niches provide signals promote stem cell maintenance differentiated daughter cells known provide feedback signals regulate stem cell replication differentiation- recently stem cells shown regulate using autocrine mechanism existence stem cell niche first postulated schofield define local environments necessary maintenance haematopoietic stem cells1 since increasing body work focused defining stem cell niches- yet little known progenitor cell differentiated cell numbers proportions maintained airway epithelium basal cells function stem/progenitor cells can self-renew produce differentiated secretory cells ciliated cells secretory cells also act transit-amplifying cells eventually differentiate post-mitotic ciliated cells describe mode cell regulation adult mammalian stem/progenitor cells relay forward signal progeny surprisingly forward signal shown necessary daughter cell maintenance using combination cell ablation lineage tracing signalling pathway modulation show airway basal stem/progenitor cells continuously supply notch ligand daughter secretory cells without forward signals secretory progenitor cell pool fails maintained secretory cells execute terminal differentiation program convert ciliated cells thus parent stem/progenitor cell can serve functional daughter cell niche
