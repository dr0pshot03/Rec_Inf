arabidopsis npl1: phototropin homolog controlling chloroplast high-light avoidance response
chloroplasts relocate positions cell response intensity incident light moving side wall cell avoid strong light gathering front face weak light maximize light interception arabidopsis thaliana mutants defective avoidance response isolated mutated gene identified npl1 nph-like homolog nph1 nonphototropic hypocotyl blue light receptor used phototropism hence npl1 likely blue light receptor regulating avoidance response strong light
