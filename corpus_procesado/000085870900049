delayed biological recovery extinctions throughout fossil record
quickly biodiversity rebound extinctions palaeobiologists examined temporal taxonomic geographic patterns recovery following individual mass extinctions detail- analysed recoveries extinctions throughout fossil record whole measure fast biodiversity rebounds extinctions general rather individual mass extinctions calculating cross-correlation extinction origination rates across entire phanerozoic marine fossil record results show extinction rates significantly correlated contemporaneous origination rates instead correlated origination rates roughly million years later lagged correlation persists remove big five major mass extinctions indicating recovery times following mass extinctions background extinctions similar results suggest intrinsic limits quickly global biodiversity can recover extinction events regardless magnitude also imply todays anthropogenic extinctions will diminish biodiversity millions years come
