variability robustness t cell activation regulated heterogeneity protein levels 
t cells stochasticity protein expression contribute useful diversification biological functions within clonal population interfere accurate antigen discrimination combining computer modeling single cell measurements examined endogenous variation expression levels signaling proteins might affect antigen responsiveness t cell activation found cd8 co receptor fine tunes activation thresholds whereas soluble hematopoietic phosphatase shp digitally regulates cell responsiveness stochastic variation expression proteins generates substantial diversity activation within clonal population t cells co regulation cd8 shp levels ultimately limits diversity findings reveal eukaryotic cells can draw regulated variation gene expression achieve phenotypic variability controlled manner
