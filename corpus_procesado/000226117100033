rapid stepwise onset antarctic glaciation deeper calcite compensation pacific ocean
ocean depth rate calcium carbonate input surface waters equals rate dissolution termed calcite compensation depth present depth m variation within ocean basins calcite compensation depth linked ocean acidity turn linked atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations hence global climate geological records changes calcite compensation depth show prominent deepening km near eocene/oligocene boundary similar to34 million years ago significant permanent ice sheets first appeared antarctica- relationship two events poorly understood present ocean sediment records calcium carbonate content well carbon oxygen isotopic compositions tropical pacific ocean cover eocene/oligocene boundary find deepening calcite compensation depth rapid previously documented occurred two jumps years synchronous stepwise onset antarctic ice-sheet growth glaciation initiated climatic preconditioning interval earths orbit sun favoured cool summers changes oxygen-isotope composition across eocene/oligocene boundary large explained antarctic ice-sheet growth alone must therefore also indicate contemporaneous global cooling and/or northern hemisphere glaciation
