evidence supersolidity rotating solid helium 
supersolidity appearance zero-viscosity flow solids first indicated helium torsional oscillator experiments apparatus irrotationality superfluid component causes decouple underlying normal solid leading reduction resonant period however resonant period may altered reasons supersolidity temperature dependence elastic modulus solid helium superimposing rotation onto oscillatory measurements may distinguish supersolidity classical effects performed simultaneous measurements shear modulus observed substantial change resonant period rotational speed modulus remained unchanged contrasting behavior suggests decrease period result supersolidity
