loss harvested fish species disrupts carbon flow diverse tropical river 
harvesting threatens many vertebrate species yet whole-system manipulations conducted predict consequences vertebrate losses ecosystem function show harvested migratory detrital-feeding fish prochilodontidae: prochilodus mariae modulates carbon flow ecosystem metabolism natural declines experimental removal prochilodus decreased downstream transport organic carbon increased primary production respiration thus besides economic value prochilodus critical ecological component south american rivers lack functional redundancy species highlights importance individual species contrary theory suggests losing one species lower trophic levels can affect ecosystem functioning even species-rich ecosystems
