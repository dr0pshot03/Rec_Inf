high-resolution root spatiotemporal map reveals dominant expression patterns 
transcriptional programs regulate development exquisitely controlled space time elucidating programs underlie development essential understanding acquisition cell tissue identity present microarray expression profiles high-resolution set developmental time points within single arabidopsis root comprehensive map nearly root cell types cell type-specific transcriptional signatures often predict previously unknown cellular functions computational pipeline identified dominant expression patterns demonstrate transcriptional similarity disparate cell types dominant expression patterns along roots longitudinal axis strictly correlate previously defined developmental zones many cases observed expression fluctuation along axis robust co-regulation gene expression potential phasing gene expression identified individual roots methods combine profiles demonstrate transcriptionally rich complex programs define arabidopsis root development space time
