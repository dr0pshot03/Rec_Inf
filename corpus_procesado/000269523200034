reassessing source long-period comets
present numerical simulations model production observable long-period comets lpcs oort cloud vast reservoir icy bodies surrounding sun show inner oort cloud objects can penetrate jupiters orbit via largely unexplored dynamical pathway important dominant source known lpcs use lpc production place observationally motivated constraints population mass inner oort cloud consistent giant planet formation theory constraints indicate one comet shower producing late eocene bombardment levels likely occurred since cambrian explosion making phenomena improbable cause additional extinction events
