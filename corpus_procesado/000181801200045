unravelling angiosperm genome evolution phylogenetic analysis chromosomal duplication events
conservation gene order vertebrates evident hundreds millions years divergence comparisons arabidopsis thaliana sequence partial gene orders angiosperms flowering plants sharing common ancestry similar to170 million years ago yield conflicting results- difference may largely due propensity angiosperms undergo chromosomal duplication polyploidization subsequent gene loss diploidization evolutionary mechanisms profound consequences comparative biology integrate phylogenetic approach relating chromosomal duplications tree life genomic approach mitigating information lost diploidization show genome-wide duplication- post-dates divergence arabidopsis dicots also show inferred ancestral gene order arabidopsis reveals synteny dicots exemplified cotton additional ancient duplication events affect distant taxonomic comparisons using partial sequence data many diverse taxa better relate evolutionary history completely sequenced genomes tree life foster comparative approaches study genome organization consequences polyploidy molecular basis quantitative traits
