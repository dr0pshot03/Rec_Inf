phosphorus limitation coastal ecosystem processes
primary production coastal wetlands conventionally thought limited nitrogen although plant community pristine salt marsh found limited primarily nitrogen availability bacterial community soil limited phosphorus hence coastal wetlands possibly many ecosystems individual trophic groups may respond differently nitrogen phosphorus loading phosphorus limitation growth nitrogen-transforming bacteria will affect carbon fixation storage release mediated plants result important implications ecosystem management
