linking context reward: functional circuit hippocampal ca3 ventral tegmental area
reward-motivated behavior strongly influenced learned significance contextual stimuli environment however neural pathways mediate context-reward relations well understood identified circuit area ca3 dorsal hippocampus ventral tegmental area vta uses lateral septum ls relay theta frequency stimulation ca3 excited vta dopamine da neurons inhibited non-da neurons da neuron excitation likely mediated disinhibition local antagonism g-aminobutyric acid receptors blocked responses ca3 stimulation inactivating components ca3-ls-vta pathway blocked evoked responses vta also reinstatement cocaine-seeking contextual stimuli transsynaptic link hippocampus vta appears important substrate environmental context regulates goal-directed behavior
