c-di-amp secreted intracellular listeria monocytogenes activates host type interferon response 
intracellular bacterial pathogens listeria monocytogenes detected cytosol host immune cells induction host response often dependent microbial secretion systems l monocytogenes dependent multidrug efflux pumps mdrs using l monocytogenes mutants overexpressed mdrs identified cyclic diadenosine monophosphate c-di-amp secreted molecule able trigger cytosolic host response overexpression di-adenylate cyclase daca lmo2120 resulted elevated levels host response infection c-di-amp thus represents putative bacterial secondary signaling molecule triggers cytosolic pathway innate immunity predicted present wide variety bacteria archea
