phyllosilicate diversity past aqueous activity revealed mawrth vallis mars 
observations mars reconnaissance orbiter/compact reconnaissance imaging spectrometer mars mawrth vallis region show several phyllosilicate species indicating wide range past aqueous activity iron/magnesium fe/mg-smectite observed light-toned outcrops probably formed via aqueous alteration basalt ancient cratered terrain unit overlain rocks rich hydrated silica montmorillonite kaolinite may formed via subsequent leaching fe mg extended aqueous events change aqueous chemistry spectral feature attributed fe+ phase present many locations mawrth vallis region transition fe/mg-smectite aluminum/silicon al/si-rich units fe+-bearing materials terrestrial sediments typically associated microorganisms changes ph cations explained hydrothermal activity stratigraphy fe/mg-smectite overlain ferrous phase hydrated silica al-phyllosilicates implies complex aqueous history
