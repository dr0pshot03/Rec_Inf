sun heliosphere solar maximum
recent ulysses observations suns equator poles reveal fundamental properties three-dimensional heliosphere maximum solar activity heliospheric magnetic field originates magnetic dipole oriented nearly perpendicular instead nearly parallel suns rotation axis magnetic fields solar wind energetic charged particles low-latitude sources reach latitudes including polar caps fast high-latitude wind polar coronal holes disappear reappear together solar wind speed continues inversely correlated coronal temperature cosmic ray flux reduced symmetrically latitudes
