inhibitory fc gamma receptor engagement drives adjuvant anti-tumor activities agonistic cd40 antibodies 
cd40 member tumor necrosis factor receptor tnfr superfamily expressed antigen-presenting cells apcs essential immune activation although agonistic cd40 antibodies developed immunotherapy clinical efficacy limited found coengagement fc domain agonistic cd40 monoclonal antibodies mabs inhibitory fc gamma receptor fc gamma riib required immune activation direct comparison mabs cd40 enhanced activating fc gamma r binding hence capable cytotoxicity inhibitory fc gamma riib binding revealed enhancing fc gamma riib binding conferred immunostimulatory activity considerably greater anti-tumor responses unexpected requirement fc gamma riib enhancing cd40-mediated immune activation direct implications design agonistic antibodies tnfr therapeutics
