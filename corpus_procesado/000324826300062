wapl essential regulator chromatin structure chromosome segregation 
mammalian genomes contain several billion base pairs dna packaged chromatin fibres selected gene loci cohesin complexes proposed arrange fibres higher-order structures1- important function determining overall chromosome architecture process regulated well understood using conditional mutagenesis mouse show depletion cohesin-associated protein wapl89 stably locks cohesin dna leads clustering cohesin axial structures causes chromatin condensation interphase chromosomes findings reveal stability cohesin-dna interactions important determinant chromatin structure indicate cohesin architectural role interphase chromosome territories furthermore show regulation cohesin-dna interactions wapl important embryonic development expression genes c-myc also known myc cell cycle progression mitosis wapl-mediated release cohesin dna essential proper chromosome segregation protects cohesin cleavage protease separase thus enabling mitotic exit presence functional cohesin complexes
