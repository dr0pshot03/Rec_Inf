structures receptor binding hemagglutinins human-infecting h7n9 influenza viruses 
avian-origin human-infecting influenza h7n9 virus recently identified china evaluated viral hemagglutinin ha receptor-binding properties two human h7n9 isolates a/shanghai// sh-h7n9 containing avian-signature residue gln226 a/anhui// ah-h7n9 containing mammalian-signature residue leu226 found sh-h7n9 ha preferentially binds avian receptor analog whereas ah-h7n9 ha binds avian human receptor analogs furthermore ah-h7n9 mutant ha leu226 > gln found exhibit dual receptor-binding property indicating amino acid substitutions contribute receptor-binding switch structures sh-h7n9 ha ah-h7n9 ha mutant complex either avian human receptor analogs show ah-h7n9 can bind human receptors still retaining avian receptor-binding property
