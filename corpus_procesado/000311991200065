kinetic responses beta-catenin specify sites wnt control 
despite years work wnt signaling pathway basic mechanism extracellular wnt signal increases intracellular concentration beta-catenin still contentious circumventing much detailed biochemistry used basic principles chemical kinetics coupled quantitative measurements define reactions beta-catenin directly affected wnt signal conclude core signal transduction mechanism relatively simple two regulated phosphorylation steps partial inhibition gives rise full dynamics response subsequently maintains steady state concentration beta-catenin increased
