orchestration floral initiation apetala1 
mads-domain transcription factor apetala1 ap1 key regulator arabidopsis flower development understand molecular mechanisms underlying ap1 function identified target genes floral initiation using combination gene expression profiling genome-wide binding studies many targets encode transcriptional regulators including known floral repressors latter genes down-regulated ap1 suggesting initiates floral development abrogating inhibitory effects genes although ap1 acts predominantly transcriptional repressor earliest stages flower development advanced stages also activates regulatory genes required floral organ formation indicating dynamic mode action results imply ap1 orchestrates floral initiation integrating growth patterning hormonal pathways
