visual motion detection circuit suggested drosophila connectomics 
animal behaviour arises computations neuronal circuits understanding computations frustrated lack detailed synaptic connection maps connectomes example despite intensive investigations half century neuronal implementation local motion detection insect visual system remains elusive develop semi-automated pipeline using electron microscopy reconstruct connectome containing neurons chemical synaptic contacts within drosophila optic medulla matching reconstructed neurons examples light microscopy assigned neurons cell types assembled connectome repeating module medulla within module identified cell types constituting motion detection circuit showed connections onto individual motion-sensitive neurons circuit consistent direction selectivity results identify cellular targets future functional investigations demonstrate connectomes can provide key insights neuronal computations
