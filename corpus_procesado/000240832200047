phase separation lipid membranes analyzed high-resolution secondary ion mass spectrometry
lateral variations membrane composition postulated play central role many cellular events difficult probe membrane composition organization length scales tens hundreds nanometers present high-resolution imaging secondary ion mass spectrometry technique reveal lipid distribution within phase-separated membrane lateral resolution similar nanometers quantitative information chemical composition within small lipid domains obtained use isotopic labels identify molecular species composition variations detected within domains
