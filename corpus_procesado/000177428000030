physical map mouse genome 
physical map genome essential guide navigation allowing location gene landmark chromosomal dna constructed physical map mouse genome contains contigs overlapping bacterial clones unique markers mouse contigs aligned human genome sequence basis homology matches thus enabling use conserved synteny correspondence chromosome blocks two genomes accelerate construction mouse map map provides framework assembly whole-genome shotgun sequence data tile path clones generation reference sequence definition human-mouse alignment level resolution enables identification mouse clone corresponds almost position human genome human sequence may used facilitate construction mammalian genome maps using strategy
