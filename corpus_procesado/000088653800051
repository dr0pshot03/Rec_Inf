telomere dysfunction promotes non-reciprocal translocations epithelial cancers mice
aged humans sustain high rate epithelial cancers carcinomas breast colon whereas mice carrying common tumour suppressor gene mutations typically develop soft tissue sarcomas lymphomas among many factors may contribute species variance differences telomere length regulation telomeres comprise nucleoprotein complexes cap ends eukaryotic chromosomes maintained reverse transcriptase telomerase human cells insufficient levels telomerase lead telomere attrition cell division culture possibly ageing tumorigenesis vivo- contrast critical reduction telomere length observed mouse owing promiscuous telomerase expression long telomeres- provide evidence telomere attrition ageing telomerase-deficient p53 mutant mice promotes development epithelial cancers process fusion-bridge breakage leads formation complex non-reciprocal translocations-a classical cytogenetic feature human carcinomas data suggest model telomere dysfunction brought continual epithelial renewal life generates massive ploidy changes associated development epithelial cancers
