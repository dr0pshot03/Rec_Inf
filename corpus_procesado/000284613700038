cats lap: water uptake felis catus 
animals developed range drinking strategies depending physiological environmental constraints vertebrates incomplete cheeks use tongue drink common example lapping cats dogs show domestic cat felis catus laps subtle mechanism based water adhesion dorsal side tongue combined experimental theoretical analysis reveals felis catus exploits fluid inertia defeat gravity pull liquid mouth competition inertia gravity sets lapping frequency yields prediction dependence frequency animal mass measurements lapping frequency across family felidae support prediction suggests lapping mechanism conserved among felines
