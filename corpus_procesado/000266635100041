large-area synthesis high-quality uniform graphene films copper foils 
graphene attracting great interest distinctive band structure physical properties today graphene limited small sizes produced mostly exfoliating graphite grew large-area graphene films order centimeters copper substrates chemical vapor deposition using methane films predominantly single-layer graphene small percentage less % area layers continuous across copper surface steps grain boundaries low solubility carbon copper appears help make growth process self-limiting also developed graphene film transfer processes arbitrary substrates dual-gated field-effect transistors fabricated silicon/silicon dioxide substrates showed electron mobilities high square centimeters per volt per second room temperature
