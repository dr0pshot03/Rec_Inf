interaction-driven spectrum reconstruction bilayer graphene
nematic phase transition electronic liquids driven coulomb interactions represents new class strongly correlated electronic ground states studied suspended samples bilayer graphene annealed achieves high quasiparticle mobilities greater square centimers per volt-second bilayer graphene truly two-dimensional material complex chiral electronic spectra high quality samples allowed us observe strong spectrum reconstructions electron topological transitions can attributed nematic phase transition decrease rotational symmetry results especially surprising interaction effects observed far bilayer graphene absence applied magnetic field
