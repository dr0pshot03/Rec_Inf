recapitulation ivig anti-inflammatory activity recombinant igg fc
well established high doses monomeric immunoglobulin g igg purified pooled human plasma [ intravenous immunoglobulin ivig] confer anti inflammatory activity variety autoimmune settings however exactly effects mediated clear heterogeneity ivig recent studies demonstrated anti inflammatory activity igg completely dependent sialylation n linked glycan igg fc fragment determine precise glycan requirements anti inflammatory activity allowing us engineer appropriate igg1 fc fragment thus generate fully recombinant sialylated igg1 fc greatly enhanced potency therapeutic molecule precisely defines biologically active component ivig helps guide development ivig replacement improved activity availability
