generating electricity walking loads 
developed suspended-load backpack converts mechanical energy vertical movement carried loads weighing kilograms electricity normal walking [generating watts -fold increase previous shoe devices milliwatts] unexpectedly little extra metabolic energy compared expended carrying rigid backpack required electricity generation probably due compensatory change gait loading regime reduces metabolic power required walking electricity generation can help give field scientists explorers disaster-relief workers freedom heavy weight replacement batteries thereby extend ability operate remote areas
