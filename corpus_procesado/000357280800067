conformational plasticity native retroviral capsid revealed x-ray crystallography
retroviruses depend self-assembly capsid proteins core particle yield infectious mature virions despite essential role retroviral core high polymorphism hindered high-resolution structural analyses report x-ray structure native capsid ca protein bovine leukemia virus ca organized hexamers deviate substantially sixfold symmetry yet adjust make two-dimensional pseudohexagonal arrays mimic mature retroviral cores intra-and interhexameric quasi-equivalent contacts uncovered flexible trimeric lateral contacts among hexamers yet preserving similar dimeric interfaces making lattice conformation capsid subunit hexamer therefore dictated long-range interactions revealing hexamers can also assemble closed core particles relevant feature retrovirus biology
