climate sensitivity constrained co2 concentrations past million years 
firm understanding relationship atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration temperature critical interpreting past climate change predicting future climate change recent synthesis suggests increase global-mean surface temperature response doubling atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration termed climate sensitivity degrees c per cent likelihood range evidence inconsistent range- moreover estimates climate sensitivity based records climate change past decades thousands years carbon dioxide concentrations global temperatures similar lower today calculations tend underestimate magnitude large climate-change events may applicable climate change warmer conditions future estimate long-term equilibrium climate sensitivity modelling carbon dioxide concentrations past million years comparing calculations proxy record estimates broadly consistent estimates based short-term climate records indicate weak radiative forcing carbon dioxide highly unlikely multi-million-year timescales conclude climate sensitivity greater degrees c probably robust feature earths climate system past million years regardless temporal scaling
