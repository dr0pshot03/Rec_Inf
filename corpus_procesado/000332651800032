proof principle epitope-focused vaccine design
vaccines prevent infectious disease largely inducing protective neutralizing antibodies vulnerable epitopes several major pathogens resisted traditional vaccine development although vulnerable epitopes targeted neutralizing antibodies identified several cases hence new vaccine design methods induce epitope-specific neutralizing antibodies needed show neutralization epitope respiratory syncytial virus computational protein design can generate small thermally conformationally stable protein scaffolds accurately mimic viral epitope structure induce potent neutralizing antibodies scaffolds represent promising leads research development human respiratory syncytial virus vaccine needed protect infants young children elderly generally results provide proof principle epitope-focused scaffold-based vaccine design encourage evaluation development strategies variety vaccine targets including antigenically highly variable pathogens human immunodeficiency virus influenza
