dna-programmable nanoparticle crystallization
first shown ten years ago dna oligonucleotides can attached gold nanoparticles rationally direct formation larger assemblies since oligonucleotide-functionalized nanoparticles developed powerful diagnostic tools nucleic acids proteins intracellular probes gene regulators contrast conceptually simple yet powerful idea functionalized nanoparticles might serve basic building blocks can rationally assembled programmable base pairing interactions highly ordered macroscopic materials remains poorly developed far approach mainly resulted polymerization modest control placement periodicity distance particles within assembled material materials obtained thus far best classified amorphous polymers- although examples colloidal crystal formation exist demonstrate dna can used control crystallization nanoparticle oligonucleotide conjugates extent different dna sequences guide assembly type inorganic nanoparticle different crystalline states show choice dna sequences attached nanoparticle building blocks dna linking molecules absence presence non bonding single base flexor can adjusted gold nanoparticles assemble micrometresized face centred cubic body centred cubic crystal structures findings thus clearly demonstrate synthetically programmable colloidal crystallization possible single-component system can directed form different structures
