labelling optical erasure synaptic memory traces motor cortex
dendritic spines major loci synaptic plasticity considered possible structural correlates memory nonetheless systematic manipulation specific subsets spines cortex unattainable thus link spines memory correlational developed novel synaptic optoprobe as-parac1 activated synapse targeting photoactivatable rac1 can label recently potentiated spines specifically induce selective shrinkage as-parac1-containing spines vivo imaging as-parac1 revealed motor learning task induced substantial synaptic remodelling small subset neurons acquired motor learning disrupted optical shrinkage potentiated spines whereas affected identical manipulation spines evoked distinct motor task cortical region taken together results demonstrate newly acquired motor skill depends formation task-specific dense synaptic ensemble
