tissue-specific clocks arabidopsis show asymmetric coupling 
many organisms rely circadian clock system adapt daily seasonal environmental changes mammalian circadian clock consists central clock suprachiasmatic nucleus tightly coupled neurons synchronizes clocks peripheral tissues plants also circadian clock plant circadian clock function long assumed uncoupled studies able show weak local coupling among cells implementing two novel techniques performed comprehensive tissue-specific analysis leaf tissues show vasculature mesophyll clocks asymmetrically regulate arabidopsis circadian clock vasculature characteristics distinct tissues cycles robustly without environmental cues affects circadian clock regulation tissues furthermore found vasculature-enriched genes rhythmically expressed preferentially expressed evening whereas rhythmic mesophyll-enriched genes tend expressed morning results set stage deeper understanding vasculature circadian clock plants regulates key physiological responses flowering time
