experimental realization wheelers delayed-choice gedanken experiment
wave-particle duality strikingly illustrated wheelers delayed-choice gedanken experiment configuration two-path interferometer chosen single-photon pulse entered it: either interferometer closed two paths recombined interference observed interferometer remains open path followed photon measured report almost ideal realization gedanken experiment single photons allowing unambiguous which-way measurements choice open closed configurations made quantum random number generator relativistically separated entry photon interferometer
