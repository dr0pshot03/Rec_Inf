asymmetric inheritance oxidatively damaged proteins cytokinesis 
carbonylated proteins visualized single cells budding yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae revealing accumulate replicative age furthermore carbonylated proteins inherited daughter cells cytokinesis mother cells yeast strain lacking sir2 gene life-span determinant failed retain oxidatively damaged proteins cytokinesis findings suggest genetically determined sir2p-dependent asymmetric inheritance oxidatively damaged proteins may contribute free-radical defense fitness newborn cells
