sequential synaptic excitation inhibition shape readiness discharge voluntary behavior
animals initiate voluntary behavior key phenomenon neuroscience readiness preparatory neural activity specific regions animal brain neurons synaptic mechanisms mediating activity unknown found readiness discharge shaped sequential synaptic excitation inhibition brain crayfish procambarus clarkii readiness discharge neurons extended axon collaterals appeared activate recurring local interneurons therefore propose readiness discharge formed sequential synaptic events within brain without feedback signals downstream ganglia circuit involved suited signal processing self-generated voluntary initiation behavior
