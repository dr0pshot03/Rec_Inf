period1-associated proteins modulate negative limb mammalian circadian oscillator
clock proteins period1 per1 period2 per2 play essential roles negative transcriptional feedback loop generates circadian rhythms mammalian cells identified two per1-associated factors nono wdr5 modulate per activity reduction nono expression rna interference rnai attenuated circadian rhythms mammalian cells fruit flies carrying hypomorphic allele nearly arrhythmic wdr5 subunit histone methyltransferase complexes augmented per-mediated transcriptional repression reduction rnai diminished circadian histone methylations promoter clock gene
