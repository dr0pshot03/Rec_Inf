conditional dynamics interacting quantum dots 
conditional quantum dynamics quantum state one system controls outcome measurements another quantum system heart quantum information processing demonstrate conditional dynamics two coupled quantum dots whereby probability one quantum dot makes transition optically excited state controlled presence absence optical excitation neighboring dot interaction dots mediated tunnel coupling optically excited states can optically gated applying laser field right frequency results represent substantial progress toward realization optically effected controlled phase gate two solid state qubits
