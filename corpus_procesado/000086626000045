emergence genetic instability children treated leukemia
t cells patients received chemotherapy b-lineage acute lymphocytic leukemia studied determine whether genetic instability principal characteristic cancer cells can also occur nonmalignant cells consistent expectations genetic instability phenotype multiple mutations detected hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase hprt reporter gene independently isolated mutant t cells expressing identical rearranged t cell receptor beta tcr beta gene hypervariable regions results indicate cancer treatment can lead genetic instability nonmalignant cells individuals also suggest mechanistic paradigm induction second malignancies drug resistance
