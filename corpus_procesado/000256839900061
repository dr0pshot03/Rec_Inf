crucial role nalp3 inflammasome immunostimulatory properties aluminium adjuvants 
aluminium adjuvants typically referred alum commonly used adjuvants human animal vaccines worldwide yet mechanism underlying stimulation immune system alum remains unknown toll-like receptors critical sensing infections therefore common targets various adjuvants used immunological studies although alum known induce production proinflammatory cytokines vitro repeatedly demonstrated alum require intact toll-like receptor signalling activate immune system show aluminium adjuvants activate intracellular innate immune response system called nalp3 also known cryopyrin cias1 nlrp3 inflammasome production pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin beta interleukin macrophages response alum vitro required intact inflammasome signalling furthermore vivo mice deficient nalp3 asc apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing caspase recruitment domain caspase failed mount significant antibody response antigen administered aluminium adjuvants whereas response complete freunds adjuvant remained intact identify nalp3 inflammasome crucial element adjuvant effect aluminium adjuvants addition show innate inflammasome pathway can direct humoral adaptive immune response likely affect design effective safe adjuvants future
