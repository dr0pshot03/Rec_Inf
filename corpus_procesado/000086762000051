inorganic yellow-red pigments without toxic metals 
inorganic pigments utilized mankind since ancient times still widely used colour materials exposed elevated temperatures processing application indeed case glasses glazes ceramics alternative inorganic pigments colouring however inorganic pigments contain heavy metals transition metals can adversely effect environment human health critical levels exceeded cadmium-based pigments particular cause concern : although pigments toxic due low solubility water dilute mineral acids cadmium toxic can enter environment bioavailable form waste-disposal sites incineration plants led regulations based precautionary principle strongly restrict use cadmium pigments even though recent assessments concluded risk humans environment might significant originally feared strong demand inherently safer substitutes remains demonstrate solid solutions perovskites catao2n lataon2 constitute promising candidates substitutes: brilliance tinting strength opacity dispersability light-fastness heat stability rival cadmium pigments colour can tuned desired range yellow orange deep red simple composition adjustments constituent elements harmless perovskite-based inorganic pigment system seems promising replacement eliminate one sources cadmium emissions environment remaining concerns pigment safety
