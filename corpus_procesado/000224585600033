shotgun sequence assembly recent segmental duplications within human genome 
complex eukaryotic genomes now sequenced accelerated pace primarily using whole-genome shotgun wgs sequence assembly approaches wgs assembly initially criticized perceived inability resolve repeat structures within genomes quantify effect wgs sequence assembly large highly similar repeats comparison segmental duplication content two different human genome assemblies analysis shows large > kilobases highly identical >% duplications adequately resolved wgs assembly leads significant reduction genome length loss genes embedded within duplications comparable analyses mouse genome assemblies confirm strict wgs sequence assembly will oversimplify understanding mammalian genome structure evolution; hybrid strategy using targeted clone-by-clone approach resolve duplications proposed
