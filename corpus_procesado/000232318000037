embedded nanostructures revealed three dimensions 
nanotechnology creates new challenge materials characterization device properties now depend size shape much depend traditional parameters structure composition show z-contrast tomography scanning transmission electron microscope developed determine complete three-dimensional size shape embedded structures resolution approximately cubic nanometer results tin/silicon quantum dot system show positions quantum dots size shape structure formation mechanism can determined directly methods applicable system providing unique versatile three-dimensional visualization tool
