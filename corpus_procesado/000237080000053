detecting transient intermediates macromolecular binding paramagnetic nmr
macromolecular complex formation governed two opposing constraints specificity speed kinetic- theoretical considerations suggest significant rate enhancement can achieved either reducing dimensionality search process creation short-range attractive potential around target site implies existence transient intermediates involving non-specific binding modes show intermolecular paramagnetic relaxation enhancement pre provides means directly detecting presence investigating nature low population transient intermediates equilibrium conditions applying approach characterize search process whereby sequence-specific transcription factor homeodomain hoxd9 binds non-cognate dna sites means enhancing rate specific association pre data fast exchange regime reveal presence transient intermediates formed stochastic manner non-cognate sites whose structure similar specific complex two distinct search processes involving intra well intermolecular translocations can delineated intermolecular pre method general can readily applied investigations transient intermediates many macromolecular binding processes
