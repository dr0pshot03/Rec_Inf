immunosurveillance mechanism controls cancer cell ploidy
cancer cells accommodate multiple genetic epigenetic alterations initially activate intrinsic cell-autonomous extrinsic immune-mediated oncosuppressive mechanisms barriers oncogenesis overcome can malignant growth proceed unrestrained tetraploidization can contribute oncogenesis hyperploid cells genomically unstable report hyperploid cancer cells become immunogenic constitutive endoplasmic reticulum stress response resulting aberrant cell surface exposure calreticulin hyperploid calreticulin-exposing cancer cells readily proliferated immunodeficient mice conserved increased dna content contrast hyperploid cells injected immunocompetent mice generated tumors delay tumors exhibited reduced dna content endoplasmic reticulum stress calreticulin exposure results unveil immunosurveillance system imposes immunoselection hyperploidy carcinogen-and oncogene-induced cancers
