decorrelated neuronal firing cortical microcircuits 
correlated trial-to-trial variability activity cortical neurons thought reflect functional connectivity circuit many cortical areas organized functional columns neurons believed densely connected share common input numerous studies report high degree correlated variability nearby cells developed chronically implanted multitetrode arrays offering unprecedented recording quality reexamine question primary visual cortex awake macaques found even nearby neurons similar orientation tuning show virtually correlated variability findings suggest refinement current models cortical microcircuit architecture function: either adjacent neurons share percent inputs alternatively activity actively decorrelated
