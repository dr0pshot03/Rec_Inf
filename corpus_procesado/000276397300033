memristive switches enable stateful logic operations via material implication 
authors international technology roadmap semiconductors-the industry consensus set goals established advancing silicon integrated circuit technology-have challenged computing research community find new physical state variables charge voltage new devices new architectures offer memory logic functions- beyond available standard transistors recently ultra-dense resistive memory arrays built various two-terminal semiconductor insulator thin film devices demonstrated- among bipolar voltage-actuated switches identified physical realizations memristors memristive devices combining electrical properties memory element resistor devices first hypothesized chua ref characterized one state variables define resistance switch depending upon voltage history show family nonlinear dynamical memory devices can also used logic operations: demonstrate can execute material implication imp fundamental boolean logic operation two variables p q pimpq equivalent notporq incorporated within appropriate circuit memristive switches can thus perform stateful logic operations devices serve simultaneously gates logic latches memory use resistance instead voltage charge physical state variable
