success virulence toxoplasma result sexual recombination two distinct ancestries
toxoplasma gondii common human pathogen causing serious even fatal disease developing fetus immunocompromised patients despite ability reproduce sexually broad geographic host range toxoplasma clonal population structure comprised principally three lines analyzed polymorphic loci archetypal type ii iii strains found polymorphism limited two rather three allelic classes polymorphism detected alleles strains given type multilocus analysis nonarchetypal isolates likewise clustered vast majority alleles two distinct ancestries data strongly suggest currently predominant genotypes exist pandemic outbreak genetic mixing two discrete ancestral lines determine mixing lead extreme virulence observed strains examined f progeny cross type ii iii strain relatively avirulent mice among progeny recombinants least logs virulent either parent thus sexual recombination combining polymorphisms two distinct competing clonal lines can powerful force driving natural evolution virulence highly successful pathogen
