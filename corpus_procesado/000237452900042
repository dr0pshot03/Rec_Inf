observation backward pulse propagation medium negative group velocity
nature pulse propagation material negative value group velocity mysterious simple models seem predict pulses will propagate backward material using erbium-doped optical fiber measuring time evolution pulse intensity many points within fiber demonstrate peak pulse propagate backward inside fiber even though energy flow always forward direction
