rotational coherence sudden breakdown linear response seen room-temperature liquids 
highly energized molecules normally rapidly equilibrated solvent; finding central conventional linear-response view chemical reactions occur solution however reaction initiated -femtosecond deep ultraviolet laser pulses used eject highly rotationally excited diatomic molecules alcohols water rotational coherence persists many rotational periods despite solvent molecular dynamics simulations trace slow development molecular-scale friction clearly identifiable molecular event: abrupt liquid-structure change triggered rapid rotation example shows molecular relaxation can sometimes switch linear nonlinear response
