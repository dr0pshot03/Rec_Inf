alp7/tacc crucial target ran-gtpase-dependent spindle formation fission yeast
microtubules essential intracellular structures involved several cellular phenomena including polarity establishment chromosome segregation nuclear envelope persists mitosis closed mitosis fission yeast schizosaccharomyces pombe cytoplasmic microtubules must reorganized spindle compartmentalized nucleus mitotic entry ideal mechanism might take advantage evolutionarily conserved microtubule formation system uses ran-gtpase nuclear transport machinery- targets ran spindle formation identified yeast show microtubule-associated protein alp7 forms complex alp14 target ran yeast spindle formation ran-deficient pim1 mutant pim1-f201s failed show mitosis-specific nuclear accumulation alp7 moreover mutant exhibited compromised spindle formation early mitotic delay importantly defects suppressed alp7 artificially targeted nucleus ran-independent importin-alpha-mediated system thus ran targets alp7 alp14 achieve nuclear spindle formation might differentiate targets depending whether organism undergoes closed open mitosis
