merging photoredox catalysis organocatalysis: direct asymmetric alkylation aldehydes 
photoredox catalysis organocatalysis represent two powerful fields molecule activation found widespread application areas inorganic organic chemistry respectively merged two catalysis fields solve problems asymmetric chemical synthesis specifically enantioselective intermolecular alpha-alkylation aldehydes accomplished using interwoven activation pathway combines photoredox catalyst rubpycl bpy -bipyridine imidazolidinone organocatalyst broadly applicable yet previously elusive alkylation reaction now highly enantioselective operationally trivial
