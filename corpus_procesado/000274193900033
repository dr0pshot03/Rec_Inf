migrating tremors illuminate complex deformation beneath seismogenic san andreas fault
san andreas fault one extensively studied faults world yet physical character deformation mode beneath relatively shallow earthquake-generating portion remain largely unconstrained tectonic non-volcanic tremor recently discovered seismic signal probably generated shear slip deep extension major faults- can provide new insight deep fate faults including san andreas fault near parkfield california examine continuous seismic data mid identifying tremor decomposing signal different families activity based shape timing waveforms multiple stations approach allows differentiation activities nearby patches deep fault begins unveil rich complex patterns tremor occurrence find tremor exhibits nearly continuous migration extensive episodes propagating kilometres along fault strike rates kilometres per hour suggests san andreas fault remains localized through-going structure least base crust area tremor rates recurrence behaviour changed markedly wake magnitude- parkfield earthquake changes far uniform within tremor zone probably reflecting heterogeneous fault properties static dynamic stresses decaying away rupture systematic recurrence tremor demonstrated suggests potential monitor detailed time-varying deformation portion deep san andreas fault deformation unsteadily loads shallower zone last ruptured magnitude- fort tejon earthquake
