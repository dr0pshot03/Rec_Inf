rapid vapor deposition highly conformal silica nanolaminates
highly uniform conformal coatings can made alternating exposures surface vapors two reactants process commonly called atomic layer deposition ald application ald however limited slow deposition rates theoretical maximum one monolayer per cycle show alternating exposure surface vapors trimethylaluminum tristert-butoxy silanol deposits highly conformal layers amorphous silicon dioxide aluminum oxide nanolaminates rates nanometers monolayers per cycle process allows uniform lining filling long narrow holes propose ald layers grow previously unknown catalytic mechanism also operates rapid ald many metal silicates process allow improved production many devices trench insulation transistors microelectronics planar waveguides microelectromechanical structures multilayer optical filters protective layers diffusion oxidation corrosion
