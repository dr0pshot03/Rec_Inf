enhanced atmospheric loss protoplanets giant impact phase presence oceans 
atmospheric compositions venus earth differ significantly venusian atmosphere containing times much ar atmosphere earth different effects solar wind planet-forming materials earth venus proposed account difference atmospheric composition cause compositional difference yet fully resolved propose absence presence ocean surface protoplanet giant impact phase determined subsequent atmospheric amount composition using numerical simulations demonstrate presence ocean significantly enhances loss atmosphere giant impact owing two effects: evaporation ocean lower shock impedance ocean compared ground protoplanets near earths orbit expected oceans whereas near venus orbit therefore suggest remnants noble-gas rich proto-atmosphere survived venus earth proposed mechanism explains differences atmospheric contents argon krypton xenon venus earth neon must escaped planets atmospheres later yield observed ratio neon argon
