glycosylation immune system 
almost key molecules involved innate adaptive immune response glycoproteins cellular immune system specific glycoforms involved folding quality control assembly peptide-loaded major histocompatibility complex mhc antigens t cell receptor complex although glycopeptide antigens presented mhc generation peptide antigens glycoproteins may require enzymatic removal sugars protein can cleaved oligosaccharides attached glycoproteins junction t cells antigen-presenting cells help orient binding faces provide protease protection restrict nonspecific lateral protein-protein interactions humoral immune system immunoglobulins complement components glycosylated although major function sugars contribute stability proteins attached specific glycoforms involved recognition events example rheumatoid arthritis autoimmune disease agalactosylated glycoforms aggregated immunoglobulin g may induce association mannose-binding lectin contribute pathology
