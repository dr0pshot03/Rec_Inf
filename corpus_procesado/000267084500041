polar gradients dyrk-family kinase pom1 couple cell length cell cycle 
cells normally grow certain size enter mitosis divide entry mitosis depends activity cdk1 inhibited wee1 kinase activated cdc25 phosphatase however cells sense size mitotic commitment remains unknown show intracellular gradient dual-specificity tyrosine-phosphorylation regulated kinase dyrk pom1 emanates ends rod-shaped schizosaccharomyces pombe cells serves measure cell length control mitotic entry pom1 provides positional information polarized growth inhibit cell division cell ends- discovered pom1 also dose-dependent g2-m inhibitor genetic analyses indicate pom1 negatively regulates cdr1 cdr2 two previously described wee1 inhibitors sad kinase family- inhibition may direct vivo vitro evidence suggest pom1 phosphorylates cdr2 whereas cdr1 cdr2 localize medial cortical region pom1 forms concentration gradients cell tips overlap cdr1 cdr2 short cells long cells disturbing pom1 gradients leads cdr2 phosphorylation imposes g2 delay short cells pom1 prevents precocious m-phase entry suggesting higher medial pom1 levels inhibit cdr2 promote g2 delay thus gradients pom1 cell ends provide measure cell length regulate m-phase entry
