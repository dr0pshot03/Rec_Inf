emerging fungal threats animal plant ecosystem health
past two decades seen increasing number virulent infectious diseases natural populations managed landscapes animals plants unprecedented number fungal fungal-like diseases recently caused severe die-offs extinctions ever witnessed wild species jeopardizing food security human activity intensifying fungal disease dispersal modifying natural environments thus creating new opportunities evolution argue nascent fungal infections will cause increasing attrition biodiversity wider implications human ecosystem health unless steps taken tighten biosecurity worldwide
