imaging drosophila gene activation polymerase pausing vivo 
since early 1960s imaging studies drosophila sp polytene chromosomes provided unique views gene transcription vivo dramatic changes chromatin structure accompany gene activation can visualized chromosome puffs now live-cell imaging techniques coupled protein-dna crosslinking assays genome-wide scale allow detailed mechanistic questions addressed prompting re-evaluation models transcription regulation drosophila mammals
