explaining excess rare species natural species abundance distributions
observation species ecological communities exceptionally abundant whereas rare prompted development species abundance models- nevertheless despite large literature commonness rarity species inspired pioneering studies widespread empirical patterns species abundance resist easy explanation notable among observation large assemblages rare species log normal model predicts use long-term -year data set estuarine fish community show ecological community can separated two components core species persistent abundant biologically associated estuarine habitats log normally distributed occasional species occur infrequently record typically low abundance different habitat requirements follow log series distribution distributions overlaid producing negative skew characterizes real data sets
