isolating uncultivable microorganisms pure culture simulated natural environment 
majority >% microorganisms environment resist cultivation laboratory ribosomal rna analysis suggests uncultivated organisms found nearly every prokaryotic group several divisions known cultivable representatives designed diffusion chamber allowed growth previously uncultivated microorganisms simulated natural environment colonies representative marine organisms isolated pure culture isolates grow artificial media alone formed colonies presence microorganisms observation may help explain nature microbial uncultivability
