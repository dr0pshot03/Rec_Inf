dual epithelial origin vertebrate oral teeth 
oral cavity vertebrates generally thought arise ectodermal invagination consistent oral teeth proposed arise exclusively ectoderm contributing tooth enamel epithelium neural crest derived mesenchyme contributing dentin pulp- yet many vertebrate groups teeth restricted oral cavity- extend posteriorly pharyngeal teeth derived either directly endodermal epithelium ectodermal epithelium reached location mouth pharyngeal slits however oropharyngeal membrane forms sharp ecto/ endodermal border broken fate cells poorly known using transgenic axolotls combination fate mapping approaches present reliable evidence oral teeth derived ectoderm endoderm moreover demonstrate teeth mixed ecto/ endodermal origin despite enamel epithelia different embryonic source oral teeth axolotl display striking developmental uniformities otherwise identical suggests dominant role neural crest mesenchyme epithelia tooth initiation evolutionary point view essential factor teeth evolution odontogenic capacity neural crest cells regardless possible outside-in inside-out influx epithelium
