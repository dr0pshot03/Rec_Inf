evidence superfluidity para-hydrogen clusters inside helium- droplets kelvin 
linear carbonyl sulfide ocs molecule surrounded para-hydrogen ph2 molecules similar numbers ortha-deuterium od2 molecules within large helium- he- droplets inside mixed he-/he- droplets investigated infrared spectroscopy pure he- droplets kelvin systems exhibited spectral features indicate excitation angular momentum around ocs axis colder he-/he- droplets kelvin features remained od2 cluster spectra disappeared ph2 spectra indicating angular momentum longer excited results consistent onset superfluidity thereby providing first evidence superfluidity liquid helium
