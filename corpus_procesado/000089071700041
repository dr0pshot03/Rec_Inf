evidence superfluidity para-hydrogen clusters inside helium droplets kelvin
linear carbonyl sulfide ocs molecule surrounded para-hydrogen ph molecules similar numbers ortha-deuterium od molecules within large helium he- droplets inside mixed he-/he droplets investigated infrared spectroscopy pure droplets kelvin systems exhibited spectral features indicate excitation angular momentum around ocs axis colder he-/he droplets kelvin features remained od cluster spectra disappeared ph spectra indicating angular momentum longer excited results consistent onset superfluidity thereby providing first evidence superfluidity liquid helium
