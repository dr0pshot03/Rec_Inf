role saccharomyces cerevisiae histone h2a dna repair
histone proteins associate compact eukaryotic nuclear dna form chromatin basic unit chromatin nucleosome made base pairs dna wrapped around two four core histones h2a h2b h3 h4 chromatin structure regulation important transcription dna replication- therefore thought dna-damage signalling repair components might also modulate chromatin structure characterized conserved motif carboxy terminus core histone h2a saccharomyces cerevisiae contains consensus phosphorylation site phosphatidylinositol--oh kinase related kinases pikks motif important survival presence agents generate dna double-strand breaks phosphorylation motif response dna damage dependent pikk family member mec1 motif necessary mec1-dependent cell-cycle transcriptional responses dna damage required efficient dna double-strand break repair non-homologous end joining addition motif role determining higher order chromatin structure thus phosphorylation core histone response dna damage may cause alteration chromatin structure facilitates dna repair
