imaging sublimation dynamics colloidal crystallites 
studied kinetics sublimating crystals single-particle resolution experiments colloidal spheres computer simulations short-range attraction spheres led crystallites one three layers thick spheres tracked optical microscopy attraction reduced crystals sublimated large crystallites sublimated escape particles perimeter rate shrinkage greatly enhanced however size decreased less particles depending location phase diagram size crystallites transformed dense amorphous structure rapidly vaporized enhancement kinetics metastable unstable phases may play major role melting freezing annealing crystals
