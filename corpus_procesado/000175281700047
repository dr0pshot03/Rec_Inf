experimental quantum cloning single photons
although perfect copying unknown quantum systems forbidden laws quantum mechanics approximate cloning possible natural way realizing quantum cloning photons stimulated emission context fundamental quantum limit quality clones imposed unavoidable presence spontaneous emission experiment single input photon stimulates emission additional photons source basis parametric down-conversion leads production quantum clones near-optima[ fidelity also demonstrate universality copying procedure showing fidelity achieved arbitrary input states
