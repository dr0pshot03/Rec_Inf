ultrafast superheating melting bulk ice
superheating solid temperature beyond melting point without solid actually melting well-known phenomenon occurs many substances- particularly can readily produced high-quality crystals principle ice also amenable superheating complex three-dimensional network hydrogen bonds holds water molecules together gives rise unusual solid liquid properties- strongly affects melting behaviour ice- particular ice usually contains many defects owing directionality hydrogen bonds however simulations readily able create defect free ice can superheated show exciting oh stretching mode water possible superheat ice using ice sample initial temperature k observe average temperature rise +/ 2k persists monitored time interval ps without melting
