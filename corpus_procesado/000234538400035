ultrafast superheating melting bulk ice 
superheating solid temperature beyond melting point without solid actually melting well-known phenomenon occurs many substances1- particularly can readily produced high-quality crystals principle ice also amenable superheating complex three-dimensional network hydrogen bonds holds water molecules together gives rise unusual solid liquid properties6- strongly affects melting behaviour ice12-; particular ice usually contains many defects owing directionality hydrogen bonds however simulations readily able create defect free ice can superheated1516 show exciting oh stretching mode water possible superheat ice using ice sample initial temperature k observe average temperature rise +/ 2k persists monitored time interval ps without melting
