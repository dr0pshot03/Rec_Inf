aconitase couples metabolic regulation mitochondrial dna maintenance
mitochondrial dna mtdna essential cells maintain respiratory competency inherited protein-dna complex called nucleoid identified mtdna-associated proteins yeast among mitochondrial aconitase aco1p show krebs-cycle enzyme essential mtdna maintenance independent catalytic activity regulation aco1 expression hap retrograde metabolic signaling pathways directly affects mtdna maintenance constitutively expressed aco1p can replace mtdna packaging function high-mobility-group protein abf2p thus aco1p may integrate metabolic signals mtdna maintenance
