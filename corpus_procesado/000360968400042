reinvigoration southern ocean carbon sink 
several studies suggested carbon sink southern ocean-the oceans strongest region uptake anthropogenic co2-has weakened recent decades demonstrated basis multidecadal analyses surface ocean co2 observations weakening trend stopped around southern ocean regained expected strength based growth atmospheric co2 three southern ocean sectors contributed reinvigoration carbon sink yet differences processes sectors exist related tendency toward zonally asymmetric atmospheric circulation large decadal variations southern ocean carbon sink suggest rather dynamic ocean carbon cycle varies time previously recognized
