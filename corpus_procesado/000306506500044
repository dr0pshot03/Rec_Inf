proto-genes de novo gene birth
novel protein-coding genes can arise either re-organization pre-existing genes de novo processes involving re-organization pre-existing genes notably gene duplication extensively described contrast de novo gene birth remains poorly understood mainly translation sequences devoid genes non-genic sequences expected produce insignificant polypeptides rather proteins specific biological functions- formalize evolutionary model according functional genes evolve de novo transitory proto-genes generated widespread translational activity non-genic sequences testing model genome scale saccharomyces cerevisiae detect translation hundreds short species-specific open reading frames orfs located non-genic sequences translation events seem provide adaptive potential suggested differential regulation upon stress signatures retention natural selection line model establish s cerevisiae orfs can placed within evolutionary continuum ranging non-genic sequences genes identify similar candidate proto-genes among s cerevisiae orfs find de novo gene birth reservoir may prevalent sporadic gene duplication work illustrates evolution exploits seemingly dispensable sequences generate adaptive functional innovation
