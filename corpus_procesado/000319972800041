coupling single trapped atom nanoscale optical cavity
hybrid quantum devices dissimilar quantum systems combined order attain qualities available either system alone may enable far-reaching control quantum measurement sensing information processing paradigmatic example trapped ultracold atoms offer excellent quantum coherent properties coupled nanoscale solid-state systems allow strong interactions demonstrate deterministic interface single trapped rubidium atom nanoscale photonic crystal cavity precise control atoms position allows us probe cavity near-field resolution diffraction limit observe large atom-photon coupling approach may enable realization integrated strongly coupled quantum nano-optical circuits
