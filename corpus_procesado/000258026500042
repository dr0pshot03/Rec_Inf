functionalizing hydrogen-bonded surface networks self-assembled monolayers 
one central challenges nanotechnology development flexible efficient methods creating ordered structures nanometre precision extended length scale supramolecular self assembly surfaces offers attractive features regard: bottom approach thus allows simple rapid creation surface assemblies readily tuned choice molecular building blocks used stabilized hydrogen bonding- van der waals interactions pi-pi bonding metal coordination blocks assemblies form two dimensional open networks- particular interest possible applications well defined pores can used precise localization confinement guest entities molecules clusters can add functionality supramolecular network another widely used method producing surface structures involves self assembled monolayers sams introduced unprecedented flexibility ability tailor interfaces generate patterned surfaces- sams part top-down technology limited terms spatial resolution can achieved therefore rationalized particularly powerful fabrication platform might realized combining non covalent self assembly porous networks sams former providing nanometre scale precision latter allowing versatile functionalization show two strategies can indeed combined create integrated network sam hybrid systems sufficiently robust processing show supramolecular network sam can deposited solution enable widespread flexible use combined fabrication method
