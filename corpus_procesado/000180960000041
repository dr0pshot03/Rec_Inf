low-noise current amplifier based mesoscopic josephson junction 
used band structure mesoscopic josephson junction construct low-noise amplifiers taking advantage quantum dynamics josephson junction ie interplay interlevel transitions coulomb blockade cooper pairs created transistor-like devices bloch oscillating transistors considerable current gain high-input impedance transistors correlated supercurrent cooper pairs controlled small base current made single electrons devices reached current power gains order respectively noise temperature estimated around kelvin noise temperatures less kelvin can realistically achieved devices provide quantum-electronic building blocks will useful low temperatures low-noise circuit applications intermediate impedance level
