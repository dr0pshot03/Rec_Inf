selective cortical representation attended speaker multi-talker speech perception 
humans possess remarkable ability attend single speakers voice multi-talker background1- auditory system manages extract intelligible speech acoustically complex adverse listening conditions known indeed clear attended speech internally represented45 using multi-electrode surface recordings cortex subjects engaged listening task two simultaneous speakers demonstrate population responses non-primary human auditory cortex encode critical features attended speech: speech spectrograms reconstructed based cortical responses mixture speakers reveal salient spectral temporal features attended speaker subjects listening speaker alone simple classifier trained solely examples single speakers can decode attended words speaker identity find task performance well predicted rapid increase attention-modulated neural selectivity across single-electrode population-level cortical responses findings demonstrate cortical representation speech merely reflect external acoustic environment instead gives rise perceptual aspects relevant listeners intended goal
