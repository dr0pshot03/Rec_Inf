nuclear receptor rev-erba critical lithium-sensitive component circadian clock 
lithium commonly used treat bipolar disorder associated altered circadian rhythm lithium potent inhibitor glycogen synthase kinase gsk3 regulates circadian rhythm several organisms experiments cultured cells show gsk3 beta phosphorylates stabilizes orphan nuclear receptor rev-erb alpha negative component circadian clock lithium treatment cells leads rapid proteasomal degradation rev-erb alpha activation clock gene bmal1 form rev-erb alpha insensitive lithium interferes expression circadian genes control rev-erb alpha protein stability thus critical component peripheral clock biological target lithium therapy
