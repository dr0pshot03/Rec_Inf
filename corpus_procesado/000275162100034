geodynamo solar wind magnetopause billion years ago 
stellar wind standoff planetary magnetic field prevents atmospheric erosion water loss although early earth retained water atmosphere thus evolved habitable planet little known earths magnetic field strength time report paleointensity results single silicate crystals bearing magnetic inclusions record geodynamo billion years ago measured field strength similar % present-day field combined greater paleoarchean solar wind pressure paleofield strength data suggest steady-state magnetopause standoff distances < earth radii similar values observed recent coronal mass ejection events data also suggest lower-latitude aurora increases polar cap area well heating expansion volatile loss exosphere affected long-term atmospheric composition
