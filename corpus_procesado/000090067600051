song replay sleep computational rules sensorimotor vocal learning 
songbirds learn correspondence vocal-motor output auditory feedback development neurons motor cortex analog adult zebra finches show timing structure activity elicited playback song sleep matches activity daytime singing motor activity leads syllables matching sensory response depends sequence typically three preceding syllables thus sensorimotor correspondence reflected temporally precise activity patterns single neurons use long sensory memories predict syllable sequences additionally spontaneous activity neurons sleep matches sensorimotor activity form song replay data suggest model whereby sensorimotor correspondences stored singing modify behavior off-line comparison eg sleep rehearsed motor output predicted sensory feedback used adaptively shape motor output
