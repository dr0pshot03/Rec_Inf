atg7 modulates p53 activity regulate cell cycle survival metabolic stress 
withdrawal nutrients triggers exit cell division cycle induction autophagy eventually activation cell death pathways relation among events well characterized found starved mouse embryonic fibroblasts lacking essential autophagy gene product atg7 failed undergo cell cycle arrest independent e1-like enzymatic activity atg7 bind tumor suppressor p53 regulate transcription gene encoding cell cycle inhibitor p21cdkn1a prolonged metabolic stress absence atg7 resulted augmented dna damage increased p53-dependent apoptosis inhibition dna damage response deletion protein kinase chk2 partially rescued postnatal lethality atg7-/- mice thus nutrients limited atg7 regulates p53-dependent cell cycle cell death pathways
