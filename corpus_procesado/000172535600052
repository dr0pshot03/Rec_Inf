phot1 phot2 mediate blue light regulation stomatal opening 
stomatal pores higher plants allow gaseous exchange leaves situated epidermis surrounded pair guard cells control opening response many environmental stimuli including blue light opening pores mediated k+ accumulation guard cells k+ channel driven inside-negative electrical potential blue light causes phosphorylation activation plasma membrane h+-atpase creates potential- thus far blue light receptor mediating stomatal opening identified although carotenoid zeaxanthin proposed arabidopsis mutants deficient specific blue-light-mediated responses identified- four blue light receptors cryptochrome cry1 cryptochrome cry2 phot1 phot2 show double mutant phot1 phot2 stomata respond blue light although single mutants phenotypically normal results demonstrate phot1 phot2 act redundantly blue light receptors mediating stomatal opening
