resource partitioning sympatric differentiation among closely related bacterioplankton 
identifying ecologically differentiated populations within complex microbial communities remains challenging yet critical interpreting evolution ecology microbes wild describe spatial temporal resource partitioning among vibrionaceae strains coexisting coastal bacterioplankton quantitative model adaptml establishes evolutionary history ecological differentiation thus revealing populations specific seasons life styles combinations free living particle zooplankton associations ecological population boundaries frequently occur deep phylogenetic levels consistent named species however recent perhaps ongoing adaptive radiation evident vibrio splendidus comprises numerous ecologically distinct populations different levels phylogenetic differentiation thus environmental specialization may important correlate even trigger speciation among sympatric microbes
