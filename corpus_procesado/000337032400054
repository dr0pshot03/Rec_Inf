ctp synthase deficiency humans reveals central role lymphocyte proliferation
lymphocyte functions triggered antigen recognition costimulation signals associated rapid intense cell division hence metabolism adaptation nucleotide cytidine triphosphate ctp precursor required metabolism dna rna phospholipids- ctp originates two sources: salvage pathway de novo synthesis pathway depends two enzymes ctp synthases synthetases ctps1 ctps2 respective roles two enzymes known- ctp synthase activity potentially important step dna synthesis lymphocytes report identification loss-of function homozygous mutation rs145092287 ctps1 humans causes novel life-threatening immunodeficiency characterized impaired capacity activated t b cells proliferate response antigen receptor-mediated activation contrast proximal distal t-cell receptor tcr signalling events responses weakly affected absence ctps1 activated ctps1-deficient cells decreased levels ctp normal t-cell proliferation restored ctps1-deficient cells expressing wild-type ctps1 addition exogenous ctp nucleoside precursor cytidine ctps1 expression found low resting t cells rapidly upregulated following tcr activation results highlight key specific role ctps1 immune system capacity sustain proliferation activated lymphocytes immune response ctps1 may therefore represent therapeutic target immunosuppressive drugs specifically dampen lymphocyte activation
