pulmonary macrophage transplantation therapy 
bone-marrow transplantation effective cell therapy requires myeloablation increases infection risk mortality recent lineage-tracing studies documenting resident macrophage populations self-maintain independently haematological progenitors prompted us consider organ-targeted cell-specific therapy using granulocytemacrophage colony-stimulating factor gm-csf receptor-beta-deficient csf2rb-/- mice develop myeloid cell disorder identical hereditary pulmonary alveolar proteinosis hpap children csf2ra csf2rb mutations show pulmonary macrophage transplantation pmt either wild-type csf2rb-gene-corrected macrophages without myeloablation safe well-tolerated one administration corrected lung disease secondary systemic manifestations normalized disease-related biomarkers prevented disease-specific mortality pmt-derived alveolar macrophages persisted least one year therapeutic effects findings identify mechanisms regulating alveolar macrophage population size health disease indicate gm-csf required phenotypic determination alveolar macrophages support translation pmt first specific therapy children hpap
