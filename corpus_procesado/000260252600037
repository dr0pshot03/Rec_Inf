bax activation initiated novel interaction site
bax pro apoptotic protein bcl family stationed cytosol activated diversity stress stimuli induce cell death anti apoptotic proteins bcl counteract bax mediated cell death although interaction site confers survival functionality defined anti apoptotic proteins activation site identified bax rendering explicit trigger mechanism unknown previously developed stabilized alpha helix bcl domains sahbs directly initiate bax mediated mitochondrial apoptosis demonstrate nmr analysis bim sahb binds bax interaction site distinct canonical binding groove characterized anti apoptotic proteins specificity human bim sahb bax interaction highlighted point mutagenesis disrupts functional activity confirming bax activation initiated novel structural location thus now defined bax interaction site direct activation establishing new target therapeutic modulation apoptosis
