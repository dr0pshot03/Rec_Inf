large capacitance enhancement two-dimensional electron system
increases gate capacitance field-effect transistor structures allow production lower-power devices compatible higher clock rates driving race developing high-k dielectrics however many-body effects electronic system can also enhance capacitance onto electron system forms laalo3/srtio3 interface fabricated top-gate electrodes can fully deplete interface mobile electrons near depletion found greater % enhancement gate capacitance using electric-field penetration measurement method show capacitance originates negative compressibility interface electron system capacitance enhancement exists room temperature arises low electron densities disorder strong in-plane conductance much smaller quantum conductance
