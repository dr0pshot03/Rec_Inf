type interferon responses rhesus macaques prevent siv infection slow disease progression
inflammation hiv infection predictive non-aids morbidity death higher set point plasma virus load virus acquisition3 thus therapeutic agents development reduce causes consequences however inflammation may simultaneously confer detrimental beneficial effects dichotomy particularly applicable type interferons ifn-i contributing innate control infection- also provide target cells virus acute infection impair cd4 t-cell recovery associated disease progression- manipulated ifn-i signalling rhesus macaques macaca mulatta simian immunodeficiency virus sly transmission acute infection two complementary vivo interventions show blockade ifn-i receptor caused reduced antiviral gene expression increased siv reservoir size accelerated cd4 t-cell depletion progression aids despite decreased t-cell activation contrast ifn-a2a administration initially upreg-ulated expression antiviral genes prevented systemic infection however continued ifn-a2a treatment induced ifn-i desensitization decreased antiviral gene expression enabling infection increased siv reservoir size accelerated cd4 t-cell loss thus timing ifn-induced innate responses acute siv infection profoundly affects overall disease course outweighs detrimental consequences increased immune activation yet clinical consequences manipulation ifn signalling difficult predict vivo therapeutic interventions human studies approached caution
