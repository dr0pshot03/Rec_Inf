tarp auxiliary subunits switch ampa receptor antagonists partial agonists 
quinoxalinedione compounds cyano--nitroquinoxaline--dione cnqx commonly used alpha-amino--hydroxy--methyl--isoxazolepropionic acid ampa receptor antagonists however find presence transmembrane ampa receptor regulatory proteins tarps ampa receptor auxiliary subunits cnqx acts partial agonist cnqx induced small depolarizing currents neurons central nervous system reconstitution agonist activity required coexpression tarps crystal structure cnqx bound tarp-less ampa receptor ligand-binding domain showed although cnqx induces partial domain closure movement transduced linker separation suggesting tarps may increase agonist efficacy strengthening coupling domain closure channel opening results demonstrate presence auxiliary subunit can determine whether compound functions agonist antagonist
