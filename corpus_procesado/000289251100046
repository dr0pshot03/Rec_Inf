surface-plasmon holography white-light illumination 
recently emerging three-dimensional 3d displays electronic shops imitate depth illusion overlapping two parallax 2d images either polarized glasses viewers required wear lenticular lenses fixed directly display holography hand provides real 3d imaging although usually limiting colors monochrome so-called rainbow holograms-mounted example credit cards-are also produced parallax images change color viewing angle report holographic technique based surface plasmons can reconstruct true 3d color images colors reconstructed satisfying resonance conditions surface plasmon polaritons individual wavelengths real 3d color images can viewed angle just like original object
