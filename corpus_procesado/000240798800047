centrosome polarization delivers secretory granules immunological synapse 
cytotoxic t lymphocytes ctls destroy virally infected tumorigenic cells releasing contents specialized secretory lysosomes termed lytic granules immunological synapse formed ctl target contact target cell microtubule organizing centre ctl polarizes towards target granules move along microtubules minus-end direction towards polarized microtubule organizing centre however final steps secretion remained unclear show ctls require actin plus-end microtubule motors secretion instead centrosome moves contacts plasma membrane central supramolecular activation cluster immunological synapse actin iqgap1 cleared away synapse granules delivered directly plasma membrane data show ctls use previously unreported mechanism delivering secretory granules immunological synapse granule secretion controlled centrosome delivery plasma membrane
