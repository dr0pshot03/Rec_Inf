controlled rotation optically trapped microscopic particles 
demonstrate controlled rotation optically trapped objects spiral interference pattern pattern generated interfering annular shaped laser beam reference beam objects trapped spiral arms pattern changing optical path length causes pattern thus trapped objects rotate structures silica microspheres microscopic glass rods chromosomes set rotation rates excess hertz technique depend intrinsic properties trapped particle thus offers important applications optical biological micromachines
