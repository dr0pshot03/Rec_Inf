tequila neurotrypsin ortholog regulates long-term memory formation drosophila 
mutations human neurotrypsin gene associated autosomal recessive mental retardation understand pathophysiological consequences lack serine protease studied tequila teq drosophila neurotrypsin ortholog using associative memory behavioral readout found teq inactivation resulted long-term memory ltm specific defect ltm conditioning wild-type flies teq expression transiently increased mushroom bodies moreover specific inhibition teq expression adult mushroom bodies resulted reversible ltm defect hence teq pathway essential information processing drosophila
