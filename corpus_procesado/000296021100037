evolution gene expression levels mammalian organs 
changes gene expression thought underlie many phenotypic differences species however large-scale analyses gene expression evolution recently prevented technological limitations report sequencing polyadenylated rna six organs across ten species represent major mammalian lineages placentals marsupials monotremes birds evolutionary outgroup goal understanding dynamics mammalian transcriptome evolution show rate gene expression evolution varies among organs lineages chromosomes owing differences selective pressures: transcriptome change slow nervous tissues rapid testes slower rodents apes monotremes rapid x chromosome right formation although gene expression evolution mammals strongly shaped purifying selection identify numerous potentially selectively driven expression switches occurred different rates across lineages tissues probably contributed specific organ biology various mammals
