prevention transthyretin amyloid disease changing protein misfolding energetics
genetic evidence suggests inhibition amyloid fibril formation small molecules effective amyloid diseases known amyloid inhibitors appear function shifting aggregation equilibrium away amyloid state describe series transthyretin amyloidosis inhibitors functioned increasing kinetic barrier associated misfolding preventing amyloidogenesis stabilizing native state trans-suppressor mutation threonine -> methionine known ameliorate familial amyloid disease also functioned kinetic stabilization implying small-molecule strategy effective treating amyloid diseases
