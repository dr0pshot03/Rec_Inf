samoa-tonga great earthquake triggered doublet
great earthquakes seismic magnitudes least usually involve abrupt sliding rock masses boundary tectonic plates interplate ruptures produce dynamic static stress changes can activate nearby intraplate aftershocks commonly observed trench-slope region seaward great subduction zone thrust event- earthquake sequence addressed involves rare instance great trench-slope intraplate earthquake triggered extensive interplate faulting reversing typical pattern broadly expanding seismic tsunami hazard september within two minutes initiation normal faulting event moment magnitude outer trench-slope northern end tonga subduction zone two major interplate underthrusting subevents moment magnitude total moment equal second great earthquake moment magnitude ruptured nearby subduction zone megathrust collective faulting produced tsunami waves localized regions metres run-up claimed lives samoa american samoa tonga overlap seismic signals obscured fact distinct faults separated 50km ruptured different geometries triggered thrust faulting revealed detailed seismic wave analyses extensive interplate intraplate aftershock activity activated large region northern tonga subduction zone
