observation detailed structural evidence origin birds dinosaurs light evidence dinosaur bone tissue resembles histology mammals histology bone become one focal points discussions physiology dinosaurs mesozoic birds- microstructural information focused features related vascular organization amount remodelled bone around vascular canals however finer structures received less attention although differences structures observed among modern vertebrates present evidence canaliculi-the submicrometre-sized channels interconnect bone cells vascular canals-and collagen fibre bundles bone differently organized among certain dinosaur lineages ornithomimid dinosaurs like birds mammals features canalicular structure extent fibre bundle arrangement ornithischian dinosaurs like mammals differences canalicular lamellar structure probably linked differences process rate bone formation
