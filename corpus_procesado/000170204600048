optical response high-dielectric-constant perovskite-related oxide 
optical conductivity measurements perovskite-related oxide cacu3ti4o12 provide hint physics underlying observed giant dielectric effect material low-frequency vibration displays anomalous behavior implying redistribution charge within unit cell low temperature infrared frequencies terahertz value dielectric constant similar room temperature far smatter value similar obtained lower radio frequencies kilohertz discrepancy implies presence strong absorption tow frequencies due dipole relaxation room temperature characteristic relaxation times fast less similar nanoseconds increase dramatically tow temperature suggesting large change dielectric constant may due relaxor-like dynamical stowing dipolar fluctuations nanosize domains
