limited scope latitudinal extension reef corals 
analysis present-day global depth distributions reef-building corals underlying environmental drivers contradicts commonly held belief ocean warming will promote tropical coral expansion temperate latitudes using global data set major group reef corals found corals confined shallower depths higher latitudes meters predicted shallowing per additional degree latitude latitudinal attenuation important driver phenomenon-the dose photosynthetically available radiation winter-would severely constrain latitudinal coral range extension response ocean warming latitudinal gradients species richness group also suggest higher winter irradiance depth low latitudes allowed deep-water fauna viable higher latitudes
