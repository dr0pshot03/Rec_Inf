novel antibody-antibiotic conjugate eliminates intracellular s aureus 
staphylococcus aureus considered extracellular pathogen however survival s aureus within host cells may provide reservoir relatively protected antibiotics thus enabling long-term colonization host explaining clinical failures relapses antibiotic therapy confirm intracellular reservoirs s aureus mice comprise virulent subset bacteria can establish infection even presence vancomycin introduce novel therapeutic effectively kills intracellular s aureus antibody-antibiotic conjugate consists anti-s aureus antibody conjugated highly efficacious antibiotic activated released proteolytic environment phagolysosome antibody-antibiotic conjugate superior vancomycin treatment bacteraemia provides direct evidence intracellular s aureus represents important component invasive infections
