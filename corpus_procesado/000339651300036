fast-spiking parvalbumin+ gabaergic interneurons: cellular design microcircuit function 
success story fast-spiking parvalbumin-positive pv+ gabaergic interneurons gaba gamma-aminobutyric acid mammalian central nervous system noteworthy properties interneurons completely unknown twenty years later thanks massive use subcellular patch-clamp techniques simultaneous multiple-cell recording optogenetics vivo measurements computational approaches knowledge pv+ interneurons became extensive several types pyramidal neurons findings implications beyond "small world" basic research gabaergic cells example results provide first proof principle neuroscientists might able close gaps molecular cellular network behavioral levels representing one main challenges present time furthermore results may form basis pv+ interneurons therapeutic targets brain disease future however much needs learned basic function interneurons clinical neuroscientists will able use pv+ interneurons therapeutic purposes
