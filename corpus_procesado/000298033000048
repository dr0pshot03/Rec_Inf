jamming shear
broad class disordered materials including foams glassy molecular systems colloids granular materials can form jammed states jammed system can resist small stresses without deforming irreversibly whereas unjammed systems flow applied stresses broad applicability liu-nagel jamming concept attracted intensive theoretical modelling interest prompted less experimental effort- liu-nagel framework jammed states athermal systems exist certain critical density although numerical simulations particles experience friction broadly support idea- nature jamming transition frictional grains less clear- show jamming frictional disk-shaped grains can induced application shear stress densities lower critical value isotropic shear-free jamming occurs jammed states much richer phenomenology isotropic jammed states: small applied shear stresses states fragile strong force network percolates one direction minimum shear stress needed create robust shear-jammed states strong force network percolating directions transitions unjammed fragile states fragile shear-jammed states controlled fraction force-bearing grains fractions transitions occur statistically independent density jammed states densities lower critical value anisotropic fabric contact network minimum anisotropy shear-jammed states vanishes density approaches critical value manner reminiscent order-disorder transition
