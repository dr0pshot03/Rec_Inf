e3 ligase traf6 regulates akt ubiquitination activation 
akt signaling plays central role many biological functions cell proliferation apoptosis akt also known protein kinase b resides primarily cytosol known signaling molecules recruited plasma membrane subsequently activated growth factor stimuli found protein kinase akt undergoes lysine- chain ubiquitination important akt membrane localization phosphorylation traf6 found direct e3 ligase akt essential akt ubiquitination membrane recruitment phosphorylation upon growth-factor stimulation human cancer-associated akt mutant displayed increase akt ubiquitination turn contributing enhancement akt membrane localization phosphorylation thus akt ubiquitination important step oncogenic akt activation
