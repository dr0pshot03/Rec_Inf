mtor regulates memory cd8 t-cell differentiation
memory cd8 t cells critical component protective immunity inducing effective memory t-cell responses major goal vaccines chronic infections tumours- considerable effort gone designing vaccine regimens will increase magnitude memory response minimal emphasis developing strategies improve functional qualities memory t cells show mtor mammalian target rapamycin also known frap1 major regulator memory cd8 t-cell differentiation contrast expected immunosuppressive drug rapamycin immunostimulatory effects generation memory cd8 t cells treatment mice rapamycin following acute lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infection enhanced quantity also quality virus-specific cd8 t cells similar effects seen immunization mice vaccine based non-replicating virus-like particles addition rapamycin treatment also enhanced memory t-cell responses non-human primates following vaccination modified vaccinia virus ankara rapamycin effective expansion contraction phases t-cell response expansion phase increased number memory precursors contraction phase effector memory transition accelerated memory t-cell differentiation program experiments using rna interference inhibit expression mtor raptor also known 4932417h02rik fkbp12 also known fkbp1a antigen-specific cd8 t cells showed mtor acts intrinsically mtorc1 mtor complex pathway regulate memory t-cell differentiation thus studies identify molecular pathway regulating memory formation provide effective strategy improving functional qualities vaccine-or infection-induced memory t cells
