diphthamide biosynthesis requires organic radical generated iron-sulphur enzyme 
archaeal eukaryotic translation elongation factor contain unique post-translationally modified histidine residue called diphthamide target diphtheria toxin biosynthesis diphthamide proposed involve three steps first formation c-c bond histidine residue -amino--carboxypropyl group s-adenosyl-l-methionine sam however details biosynthesis remain unknown present structural biochemical evidence showing first step diphthamide biosynthesis archaeon pyrococcus horikoshii uses novel iron-sulphur-cluster enzyme dph2 dph2 homodimer monomers can bind [4fe-4s] cluster biochemical data suggest unlike enzymes radical sam superfamily dph2 form canonical -deoxyadenosyl radical instead breaks cc met-s bond sam generates -amino--carboxypropyl radical results suggest p horikoshii dph2 represents previously unknown sam-dependent [4fe-4s]-containing enzyme catalyses unprecedented chemistry
