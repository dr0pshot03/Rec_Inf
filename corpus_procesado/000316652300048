calhm1 ion channel mediates purinergic neurotransmission sweet bitter umami tastes
recognition sweet bitter umami tastes requires non-vesicular release taste bud cells atp acts neurotransmitter activate afferent neural gustatory pathways however atp released fulfil function fully understood show calcium homeostasis modulator calhm1 voltage-gated ion channel indispensable taste-stimuli-evoked atp release sweet- bitter umami-sensing taste bud cells calhm1 knockout mice severely impaired perceptions sweet bitter umami compounds whereas recognition sour salty tastes remains mostly normal calhm1 deficiency affects taste perception without interfering taste cell development integrity calhm1 expressed specifically sweet/bitter/umami-sensing type ii taste bud cells heterologous expression induces novel atp permeability releases atp cells response manipulations activate calhm1 ion channel knockout calhm1 strongly reduces voltage-gated currents type ii cells taste-evoked atp release taste buds without affecting excitability taste cells taste stimuli thus calhm1 voltage-gated atp-release channel required sweet bitter umami taste perception
