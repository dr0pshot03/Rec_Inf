atp-citrate lyase links cellular metabolism histone acetylation
histone acetylation single-cell eukaryotes relies acetyl coenzyme acetyl-coa synthetase enzymes use acetate produce acetyl-coa metazoans however use glucose main carbon source exposure low concentrations extracellular acetate shown histone acetylation mammalian cells dependent adenosine triphosphate atp-citrate lyase acl enzyme converts glucose-derived citrate acetyl-coa found acl required increases histone acetylation response growth factor stimulation differentiation glucose availability can affect histone acetylation acl-dependent manner together findings suggest acl activity required link growth factor-induced increases nutrient metabolism regulation histone acetylation gene expression
