jun turnover controlled jnk-dependent phosphorylation e3 ligase itch
turnover jun proteins like transcription factors regulated ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis usually processes regulated extracellular stimuli phosphorylation target protein allows recognition f box-containing e3 ubiquitin ligases case c-jun junb found extracellular stimuli also modulate protein turnover regulating activity e3 ligase means phosphorylation activation jun amino-terminal kinase jnk mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade t cell stimulation accelerated degradation c-jun junb phosphorylation-dependent activation e3 ligase itch pathway modulates cytokine production effector t cells
