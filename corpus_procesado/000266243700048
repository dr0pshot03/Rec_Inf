precise genome modification crop species zea mays using zinc-finger nucleases
agricultural biotechnology limited inefficiencies conventional random mutagenesis transgenesis targeted genome modification plants intractable plant trait engineering remains laborious time-consuming unpredictable undertaking report broadly applicable versatile solution problem: use designed zinc-finger nucleases zfns induce double-stranded break target locus describe use zfns modify endogenous loci plants crop species zea mays show simultaneous expression zfns delivery simple heterologous donor molecule leads precise targeted addition herbicide-tolerance gene intended locus significant number isolated events zfn-modified maize plants faithfully transmit genetic changes next generation insertional disruption one target locus ipk1 results herbicide tolerance expected alteration inositol phosphate profile developing seeds zfns can used plant species amenable dna delivery results therefore establish new strategy plant genetic manipulation basic science agricultural applications
