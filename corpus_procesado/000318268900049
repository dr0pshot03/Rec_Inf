structural features functional selectivity serotonin receptors 
drugs active g protein-coupled receptors gpcrs can differentially modulate either canonical noncanonical signaling pathways via phenomenon known functional selectivity biased signaling report biochemical studies showing hallucinogen lysergic acid diethylamide precursor ergotamine erg related ergolines display strong functional selectivity beta-arrestin signaling ht2b hydroxytryptamine -ht receptor whereas relatively unbiased ht1b receptor investigate structural basis biased signaling determined crystal structure human ht2b receptor bound erg compared ht1b/erg structure given relatively poor understanding gpcr structure function date insight different gpcr signaling pathways important better understand adverse favorable therapeutic activities
