antheridiogen determines sex ferns via spatiotemporally split gibberellin synthesis pathway
ferns possess ability control sex ratio maintain genetic variation colony aid antheridiogen pheromones antheridium male organ-inducing compounds related gibberellin determined ferns evolved antheridiogen-mediated communication system produce males modifying gibberellin biosynthetic pathway split two individuals different developmental stages colony antheridiogen acts bridge readily taken prothalli bioactive gibberellin pathway initiates early-maturing prothalli gametophytes within colony produce antheridiogens secrete environment secreted antheridiogen absorbed neighboring late-maturing prothalli modified bioactive gibberellin trigger male organ formation
