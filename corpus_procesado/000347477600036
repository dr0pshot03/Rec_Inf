calcium transient prevalence across dendritic arbour predicts place field properties
establishing hippocampal cellular ensemble represents animals environment involves emergence disappearance place fields specific ca1 pyramidal neurons- acquisition different spatial firing properties across active population firing flexibility diversity linked spatial memory attention task performance cellular network origin place cell features unknown basic integrate-and-fire models place firing propose features result solely varying inputs place cells recent studies suggest instead place cells may play active role regenerative dendritic events however owing difficulty performing functional recordings place cell dendrites direct evidence regenerative dendritic events exists leaving possible connection place coding unknown using multi-plane two-photon calcium imaging ca1 place cell somata axons dendrites mice navigating virtual environment show regenerative dendritic events exist place cells behaving mice surprisingly prevalence throughout arbour highly spatiotemporally variable furthermore show prevalence events predicts spatial precision persistence disappearance place fields suggests dynamics spiking throughout dendritic arbour may play key role forming hippocampal representation space
