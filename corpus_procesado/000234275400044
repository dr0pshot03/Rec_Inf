protein synthesis upon acute nutrient restriction relies proteasome function 
mechanisms protect mammalian cells amino acid deprivation partially understood found acute decrease external amino acid supply up-regulation autophagosomal-lysosomai pathway efficient translation ensured proteasomal protein degradation amino acids synthesis new proteins supplied degradation preexisting proteins whereas nascent newly formed polypeptides remained largely protected proteolysis proteasome inhibition nutrient deprivation caused rapid amino acid depletion marked impairment translation thus proteasome plays crucial rote cell survival acute disruption amino acid supply
