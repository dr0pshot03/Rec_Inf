systematic humanization yeast genes reveals conserved functions genetic modularity 
determine whether genes retain ancestral functions billion years evolution identify principles deep evolutionary divergence replaced essential yeast genes human orthologs assaying complementation lethal growth defects upon loss yeast genes nearly half % yeast genes successfully humanized sequence similarity expression partly predicted replaceability instead replaceability depended strongly gene modules: genes process tended similarly replaceable eg sterol biosynthesis eg dna replication initiation simulations confirmed selection specific function can maintain replaceability despite extensive sequence divergence critical ancestral functions many essential genes thus retained pathway-specific manner resilient drift sequences splicing protein interfaces
