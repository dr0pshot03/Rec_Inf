force needed move atom surface 
manipulation individual atoms molecules scanning probe microscopy offers ability controlled assembly single atom scale however driving forces behind atomic manipulation yet measured used atomic force microscope measure vertical lateral forces exerted individual adsorbed atoms molecules probe tip found force takes move atom depends strongly adsorbate surface results indicate moving metal atoms metal surfaces lateral force component plays dominant role furthermore measuring spatial maps forces manipulation yielded full potential energy landscape tip sample interaction
