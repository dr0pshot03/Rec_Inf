functional amyloids natural storage peptide hormones pituitary secretory granules 
amyloids highly organized cross-beta-sheet-rich protein peptide aggregates associated pathological conditions including alzheimers disease type ii diabetes however amyloids may also normal biological function demonstrated fungal prions involved prion replication amyloid protein pmel17 involved mammalian skin pigmentation found peptide protein hormones secretory granules endocrine system stored amyloid-like cross-beta-sheet-rich conformation thus functional amyloids pituitary organs can contribute normal cell tissue physiology
