doppler effect embryonic pattern formation 
embryonic development temporal spatial cues coordinated generate segmented body axis sequentially segmenting animals rhythm segmentation reported controlled time scale genetic oscillations periodically trigger new segment formation however present real-time measurements genetic oscillations zebrafish embryos showing time scale sufficient explain temporal period segmentation second time scale rate tissue shortening contributes period segmentation doppler effect contribution modulated gradual change oscillation profile across tissue conclude rhythm segmentation emergent property controlled time scale genetic oscillations change oscillation profile tissue shortening
