crystal structure heterotrimer core saccharomyces cerevisiae ampk homologue snf1 
amp-activated protein kinase ampk central regulator energy homeostasis mammals attractive target drug discovery diabetes obesity diseases- ampk homologue saccharomyces cerevisiae known snf1 essential responses glucose starvation well cellular processes although snf1 seems activated ligand amp- report crystal structure angstrom resolution heterotrimer core snf1 ligand-binding site gamma-subunit snf4 clear structural differences schizosaccharomyces pombe enzyme although crystallographic data indicate amp can also bind snf4 glycogen-binding domain beta-subunit sip2 interacts snf4 heterotrimer still able bind carbohydrates- structure supported large body biochemical genetic data complex-- significantly structure reveals part regulatory sequence alpha-subunit snf1 sequestered snf4 demonstrating direct interaction alpha gamma-subunits indicating structure may represent heterotrimer core snf1 activated state
