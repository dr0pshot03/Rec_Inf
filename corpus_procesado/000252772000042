cathepsin k-dependent toll-like receptor signaling revealed experimental arthritis 
cathepsin k originally identified osteoclast specific lysosomal protease inhibitor considered might therapeutic potential show inhibition cathepsin k potently suppress autoimmune inflammation joints well osteoclastic bone resorption autoimmune arthritis furthermore cathepsin k-/ mice resistant experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis pharmacological inhibition targeted disruption cathepsin k resulted defective toll like receptor signaling dendritic cells response unmethylated cpg dna turn led attenuated induction t helper cells without affecting antigen presenting ability dendritic cells results suggest cathepsin k plays important role immune system may serve valid therapeutic target autoimmune diseases
