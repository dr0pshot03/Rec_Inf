long-range-projecting gabaergic neurons modulate inhibition hippocampus entorhinal cortex 
hippocampus entorhinal cortex play pivotal role spatial learning memory two forebrain regions highly interconnected via excitatory pathways using optogenetic tools identified characterized long-range gamma-aminobutyric acid-releasing gabaergic neurons provide bidirectional hippocampal-entorhinal inhibitory connectivity preferentially target gabaergic interneurons activation long-range gabaergic axons enhances sub suprathreshold rhythmic theta activity postsynaptic neurons target areas
