coherent control pulsed x-ray beams 
synchrotrons produce continuous trains closely spaced x-ray pulses application sources study atomic-scale motion requires efficient modulation beams timescales ranging nanoseconds femtoseconds however ultrafast x-ray modulators generally available report efficient subnanosecond coherent switching synchrotron beams using acoustic pulses crystal modulate anomalous low-loss transmission x-ray pulses acoustic excitation transfers energy two x-ray beams time shorter synchrotron pulse width ps gigahertz modulation diffracted x-rays also observed report different geometric arrangements switch based collision two counter-propagating acoustic pulses: doubles x-ray modulation frequency also provides means observing localized transient strain inside opaque material expect techniques scaled produce subpicosecond pulses laser-generated coherent optical phonon modulation x-ray diffraction crystals ultrafast capabilities demonstrated thus far laser-generated x-ray sources use x-ray streak cameras-
