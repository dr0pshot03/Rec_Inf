high-coverage genome sequence archaic denisovan individual 
present dna library preparation method allowed us reconstruct high-coverage 30x genome sequence denisovan extinct relative neandertals quality genome allows direct estimation denisovan heterozygosity indicating genetic diversity archaic hominins extremely low also allows tentative dating specimen basis missing evolution genome detailed measurements denisovan neandertal admixture present-day human populations generation near-complete catalog genetic changes swept high frequency modern humans since divergence denisovans
