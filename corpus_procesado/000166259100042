photoactivated fluorescence individual silver nanoclusters 
fluorescence microscopy nanoscale silver oxide ag2o reveals strong photoactivated emission excitation wavelengths shorter nanometers although blinking characteristic emission patterns demonstrate single-nanoparticle observation large-scale dynamic color changes also observed even nanoparticle identical behavior observed oxidized thin silver films enable ag2o particles grow high density silver islands data readily written films blue excitation stored data nondestructively read strong red fluorescence resulting green wavelengths longer nanometers excitation individual luminescent species thought silver nanoclusters photochemically generated oxide
