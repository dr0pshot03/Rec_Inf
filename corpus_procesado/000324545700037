usp16 contributes somatic stem-cell defects downs syndrome
downs syndrome results full partial trisomy chromosome however consequences underlying gene-dosage imbalance adult tissues remain poorly understood show ts65dn mice trisomic genes homologous genes human chromosome triplication usp16 reduces self-renewal haematopoietic stem cells expansion mammary epithelial cells neural progenitors fibroblasts addition usp16 associated decreased ubiquitination cdkn2a accelerated senescence ts65dn fibroblasts usp16 can remove ubiquitin histone h2a lysine critical mark maintenance multiple somatic tissues downregulation usp16 either mutation single normal usp16 allele short interfering rnas largely rescues defects furthermore human tissues overexpression usp16 reduces expansion normal fibroblasts postnatal neural progenitors whereas downregulation usp16 partially rescues proliferation defects downs syndrome fibroblasts taken together results suggest usp16 important role antagonizing self-renewal and/or senescence pathways downs syndrome serve attractive target ameliorate associated pathologies
