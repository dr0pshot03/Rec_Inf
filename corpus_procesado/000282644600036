tracking hydrocarbon plume transport biodegradation deepwater horizon
deepwater horizon blowout largest offshore oil spill history present results subsurface hydrocarbon survey using autonomous underwater vehicle ship-cabled sampler findings indicate presence continuous plume oil kilometers length approximately meters depth persisted months without substantial biodegradation samples collected within plume reveal monoaromatic petroleum hydrocarbon concentrations excess micrograms per liter data indicate monoaromatic input plume least kilograms per day double total source rate natural seeps monoaromatic petroleum hydrocarbons northern gulf mexico dissolved oxygen concentrations suggest microbial respiration rates within plume appreciably micromolar oxygen per day
