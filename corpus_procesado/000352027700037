two-particle interference fundamental feature quantum mechanics even less intuitive wave-particle duality single particle duality classical concepts-wave particle-are still referred interference happens ordinary space-time hand two-particle interference takes place mathematical space classical counterpart entanglement lies heart interference fundamental tests quantum mechanics involving violation bells inequalities- hong ou mandel experiment conceptually simpler situation interference two-photon amplitudes also leads behaviour impossible describe using simple classical model report realization hong ou mandel experiment using atoms instead photons create source emits pairs atoms cause one atom pair enter one two input channels beam-splitter atom enter input channel atoms spatially overlapped two inputs indistinguishable atoms always emerge together one output channels result opens way testing bells inequalities involving mechanical observables massive particles momentum using methods inspired quantum optics testing theories quantum-to-classical transition- work also demonstrates new way benchmark non-classical atom sources may interest quantum information processing quantum simulation
