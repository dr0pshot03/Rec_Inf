multiple repressive mechanisms hippocampus memory formation 
memory stabilization learning requires translational transcriptional regulations brain yet temporal molecular changes occur learning explored genomic scale used ribosome profiling rna sequencing quantify translational status transcript levels mouse hippocampus contextual fear conditioning revealed three types repressive regulations: translational suppression ribosomal protein-coding genes hippocampus learning-induced early translational repression specific genes late persistent suppression subset genes via inhibition estrogen receptor esr1/er alpha signaling behavioral analyses overexpressing nrsn1 one newly identified genes undergoing rapid translational repression activating esr1 hippocampus impaired memory formation collectively study unveils yet-unappreciated importance gene repression mechanisms memory formation
