phosphoproteomic analysis identifies grb10 mtorc1 substrate negatively regulates insulin signaling
evolutionarily conserved serine-threonine kinase mammalian target rapamycin mtor plays critical role regulating many pathophysiological processes functional characterization mtor signaling pathways however hampered paucity known substrates used large-scale quantitative phosphoproteomics experiments define signaling networks downstream mtorc1 mtorc2 characterization one mtorc1 substrate growth factor receptor-bound protein grb10 showed mtorc1-mediated phosphorylation stabilized grb10 leading feedback inhibition phosphatidylinositol kinase pi3k extracellular signal-regulated mitogen-activated protein kinase erk-mapk pathways grb10 expression frequently down-regulated various cancers loss grb10 loss well-established tumor suppressor phosphatase pten appear mutually exclusive events suggesting grb10 might tumor suppressor regulated mtorc1
