optical broadband angular selectivity
light selection based purely angle propagation long-standing scientific challenge angularly selective systems however transmission light usually also depends light frequency tailored overlap band gaps multiple one-dimensional photonic crystals different periodicity way preserve characteristic brewster modes across broadband spectrum provide theory well experimental realization all-visible spectrum p-polarized angularly selective material system method enables transparency throughout visible spectrum one angle-the generalized brewster angle-and reflection every viewing angle
