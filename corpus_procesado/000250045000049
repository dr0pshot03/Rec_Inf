effective rnai-mediated gene silencing without interruption endogenous microrna pathway 
systemic administration synthetic small interfering rnas sirnas effectively silences hepatocyte gene expression rodents primates- whether vivo gene silencing synthetic sirna can disrupt endogenous microrna mirna pathway remains addressed show effective target-gene silencing mouse hamster liver can achieved systemic administration synthetic sirna without demonstrable effect mirna levels activity indeed sirna targeting two hepatocyte-specific genes apolipoprotein b factor vii achieved efficient % silencing messenger rna transcripts third irrelevant sirna control administered mice without significant changes levels three hepatocyte-expressed mirnas mir- mir let-7a effect mirna activity moreover multiple administrations sirna targeting hepatocyte-expressed gene scap hamsters achieved long-term mrna silencing without significant changes mir levels study advances use sirnas safe effective tools silence gene transcripts animal studies supports continued advancement rna interference therapeutics using synthetic sirna
