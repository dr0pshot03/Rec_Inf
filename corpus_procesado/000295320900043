role tet3 dna dioxygenase epigenetic reprogramming oocytes
sperm eggs carry distinctive epigenetic modifications adjusted reprogramming fertilization paternal genome zygote undergoes active dna demethylation first mitosis biological significance mechanisms paternal epigenome remodelling remained unclear report within mouse zygotes oxidation methylcytosine 5mc occurs paternal genome changing 5mc hydroxymethylcytosine 5hmc furthermore demonstrate dioxygenase tet3 ref enriched specifically male pronucleus tet3-deficient zygotes conditional knockout mice paternal-genome conversion 5mc 5hmc fails occur level 5mc remains constant deficiency tet3 also impedes demethylation process paternal oct4 nanog genes delays subsequent activation paternally derived oct4 transgene early embryos female mice depleted tet3 germ line show severely reduced fecundity heterozygous mutant offspring lacking maternal tet3 suffer increased incidence developmental failure oocytes lacking tet3 also seem reduced ability reprogram injected nuclei somatic cells therefore tet3-mediated dna hydroxylation involved epigenetic reprogramming zygotic paternal dna following natural fertilization may also contribute somatic cell nuclear reprogramming animal cloning
