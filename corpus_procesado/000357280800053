seahorse tail square
whereas predominant shapes animal tails cylindrical seahorse tails square prisms seahorses use tails flexible grasping appendages spite rigid bony armor fully encases bodies explore mechanics two three-dimensional-printed models mimic either natural square prism hypothetical cylindrical architecture seahorse tail uncover whether square geometry provides functional advantages results show square prism resilient crushed provides mechanism preserving articulatory organization upon extensive bending twisting compared cylindrical counterpart thus square architecture better circular one context two integrated functions: grasping ability crushing resistance
