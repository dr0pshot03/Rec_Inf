exploitation structural regulatory diversity glutamate racemases 
glutamate racemase enzyme essential bacterial cell wall biosynthesis pathway therefore considered target antibacterial drug discovery characterized glutamate racemases several pathogenic bacteria using structural biochemical approaches describe three distinct mechanisms regulation family glutamate racemases: allosteric activation metabolic precursors kinetic regulation substrate inhibition d-glutamate recycling using d-amino acid transaminase search selective inhibitors identified series uncompetitive inhibitors specifically targeting helicobacter pylori glutamate racemase bind cryptic allosteric site used inhibitors probe mechanistic dynamic features enzyme structural kinetic mutational studies provide insight physiological regulation essential enzymes provide basis designing narrow-spectrum antimicrobial agents
