redistribution intracellular oxygen hypoxia nitric oxide: effect hif1 alpha
cells exposed low oxygen concentrations respond initiating defense mechanisms including stabilization hypoxia-inducible factor hif 1alpha transcription factor upregulates genes involved glycolysis angiogenesis nitric oxide inhibitors mitochondrial respiration prevent stabilization hif1alpha hypoxia studies cultured cells show effect result increase prolyl hydroxylase dependent degradation hif1alpha use renilla luciferase detect intracellular oxygen concentrations also demonstrate upon inhibition mitochondrial respiration hypoxia oxygen redistributed toward non-respiratory oxygen-dependent targets prolyl hydroxylases register hypoxia thus signaling consequences hypoxia may profoundly modified nitric oxide
