sequential evolution bacterial morphology co-option developmental regulator 
mechanisms lie transitions responsible diverse shapes observed living world although bacteria exhibit myriad morphologies mechanisms responsible evolution bacterial cell shape understood investigated morphological diversity group bacteria synthesize appendage-like extension cell envelope called stalk location number stalks varies among species exemplified three distinct subcellular positions stalks within rod-shaped cell body: polar genus caulobacter subpolar bilateral genus asticcacaulis show developmental regulator caulobacter crescentus spmx co-opted genus asticcacaulis specify stalk synthesis either subpolar bilateral positions also show stepwise evolution specific region spmx led gain new function localization protein drove sequential transition stalk positioning results indicate changes protein function co-option modularity key elements evolution bacterial morphology therefore similar evolutionary principles morphological transitions apply single-celled prokaryotes multicellular eukaryotes
