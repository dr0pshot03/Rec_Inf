non-fermi liquid metal without quantum criticality
key question condensed matter physics concerns whether pure three-dimensional metals can always described fermi liquids using neutron larmor diffraction overcome traditional resolution limit diffraction experiments studied lattice constants cubic itinerant-electron magnet manganese silicide mnsi low temperatures high pressures able resolve nature phase diagram mnsi establish stable extended non-fermi liquid state emerges applied pressure without quantum criticality suggests new forms quantum order may expected even far quantum phase transitions
