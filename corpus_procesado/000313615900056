asymmetric neurotransmitter release enables rapid odour lateralization drosophila 
drosophila individual olfactory receptor neurons orns project bilaterally sides brain12 bilateral rather unilateral projections may represent useful redundancy however bilateral orn projections brain also compromise ability lateralize odours nevertheless walking flying drosophila reportedly turn towards antenna strongly stimulated odour3- show orn spike releases approximately % neurotransmitter axon branch ipsilateral soma contralateral branch result odour activates antennae asymmetrically ipsilateral central neurons begin spike milliseconds contralateral neurons % higher rate contralateral neurons show walking fly can detect % asymmetry total orn input left right antennal lobes can turn towards odour less time requires fly complete stride results demonstrate neurotransmitter release properties can tuned independently output synapses formed single axon onto two target cells identical functions morphologies data also show small differences spike timing spike rate can produce reliable differences olfactory behaviour
