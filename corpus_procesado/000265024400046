wingbeat time scaling passive rotational damping flapping flight
flying animals exhibit remarkable capabilities generating maneuvers stabilizing course orientation perturbation show flapping fliers ranging size fruit flies large birds benefit substantial damping angular velocity passive mechanism termed flapping counter-torque fct fct model predicts isometrically scaled animals experience similar damping per-wingbeat time scale resulting similar turning dynamics wingbeat time regardless body size model also shows animals may simultaneously specialize maneuverability stability cost efficiency provides framework linking morphology wing kinematics maneuverability flight dynamics across wide range flying animals spanning insects bats birds
