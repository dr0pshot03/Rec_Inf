alteration stimulus-specific guard cell calcium oscillations stomatal closing arabidopsis det3 mutant
cytosolic calcium oscillations control signaling animal cells whereas plants importance remains largely unknown wild-type arabidopsis guard cells abscisic acid oxidative stress cold external calcium elicited cytosolic calcium oscillations differing amplitudes frequencies induced stomatal closure guard cells v-atpase mutant det3 external calcium oxidative stress elicited prolonged calcium increases oscillate stomatal closure abolished conversely cold abscisic acid elicited calcium oscillations det3 stomatal closure occurred normally moreover det3 guard cells experimentally imposing external calcium-induced oscillations rescued stomatal closure data provide genetic evidence stimulus-specific calcium oscillations necessary stomatal closure
