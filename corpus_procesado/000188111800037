inferences flow base earths mantle based seismic anisotropy 
applied global waveform tomography model radial anisotropy whole mantle found last hundred kilometers near core-mantle boundary horizontally polarized s-wave velocities vsh average faster similar to1% vertically polarized s-wave velocities vsv suggesting large-scale predominance horizontal shear confirms d region base mantle also mechanical boundary layer mantle convection notable exception average signature can found base two broad low-velocity regions pacific ocean africa often referred superplumes anisotropic pattern indicates onset vertical flow
