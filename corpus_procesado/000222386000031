linking albinism immunity: secrets secretory lysosomes
lysosomes membrane-bound organelles found mammalian cells contain hydrolases lipases required protein membrane degradation many cells immune system lysosomes also contain secretory proteins can released regulated exocytosis response external stimulus providing different cell types wide range effector functions melanosomes also use lysosome-related organelle secrete melanin pigmentation links albinism immunity patients uncovered number key proteins required lysosomal secretion revealed versatile secretory mechanism can fine-tuned distinct interactions different cell types
