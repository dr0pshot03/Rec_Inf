leukemogenicity aml1-eto dependent site-specific lysine acetylation 
chromosomal translocations found acute myelogenous leukemia aml generate oncogenic fusion transcription factors aberrant transcriptional regulatory properties although therapeutic targeting leukemia fusion proteins remains elusive posttranslational modifications control function targetable found aml1-eto fusion protein generated t8; translocation acetylated transcriptional coactivator p300 leukemia cells isolated t8; aml patients acetylation essential self-renewal-promoting effects human cord blood cd34+ cells leukemogenicity mouse models inhibition p300 abrogates acetylation aml1-eto impairs ability promote leukemic transformation thus lysine acetyltransferases represent potential therapeutic target aml
