rapid formation sulfuric acid particles near-atmospheric conditions
investigated formation new particles laboratory study starting h2so4 produced situ reaction oh radicals newly formed particles observed h2so4 concentrations x per cubic centimeter kelvin rough estimate yielded nucleation rate particles per cubic centimeter per second similar to10 particles per cubic centimeter h2so4 particle size greater equal nanometers findings agreement observations atmosphere results demonstrate laboratory conditions similar atmosphere particle formation occurs atmospheric h2so4 concentration levels
