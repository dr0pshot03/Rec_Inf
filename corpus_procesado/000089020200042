density cycles offspring quantity quality game driven natural selection
long-standing hypothesis posits natural selection can favour two female strategies density cycles low density females producing many smaller progeny favoured intrinsic rate increase r governs population growth peak density females producing fewer high-quality progeny favoured carrying capacity k exceeded population crashes report first example genetic r versus k selection- game promotes stable population cycles lizards decade-long fitness studies game theory demonstrated two throat-colour morphs refined selection strength natural selection varied density orange-throated females r strategists produced many eggs favoured low density conversely yellow-throated females k strategists produced large eggs favoured high density progeny size also negative frequency-dependent selection large progeny will survival advantage rare advantage disappears become common confirmed prediction seeding field plots rare common giant hatchlings thus intrinsic causes frequency density-dependent selection promotes evolutionary game two-generation oscillations
