shape-memory nanopores induced coordination frameworks crystal downsizing
flexible porous coordination polymers change structure response molecular incorporation recover original configuration guest removed demonstrated crystal downsizing twofold interpenetrated frameworks [cu-dicarboxylateamine]n regulates structural flexibility induces shape-memory effect coordination frameworks addition two structures contribute sorption process nonporous closed phase guest-included open phase isolated unusual metastable open dried phase downsizing crystals mesoscale closed phase recovered thermal treatment crystal downsizing suppressed structural mobility stabilized open dried phase successful isolation two interconvertible empty phases closed phase open dried phase provided switchable sorption properties without gate-opening behavior
