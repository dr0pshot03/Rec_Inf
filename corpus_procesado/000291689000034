long-range topological order metallic glass
glass lacks long-range periodic order characterizes crystal ceal metallic glass mg however discovered long-range topological order corresponding single crystal indefinite length structural examinations confirm mg truly amorphous isotropic unstrained yet gigapascals hydrostatic pressures every segment centimeter-length mg ribbon devitrifies independently face-centered cubic fcc crystal identical orientation using molecular dynamics simulations synchrotron x-ray techniques elucidate mismatch large ce small al atoms frustrates crystallization causes amorphization long-range fcc topological order still exists pressure induces electronic transition ce eliminates mismatch manifests topological order formation single crystal
