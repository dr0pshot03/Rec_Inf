caveolae plasma membrane invaginations may play important role numerous cellular processes including transport signaling tumor suppression targeted disruption caveolin- main protein component caveolae generated mice lacked caveolae absence organelle impaired nitric oxide calcium signaling cardiovascular system causing aberrations endothelium-dependent relaxation contractility maintenance myogenic tone addition lungs knockout animals displayed thickening alveolar septa caused uncontrolled endothelial cell proliferation fibrosis resulting severe physical limitations caveolin--disrupted mice thus caveolin- caveolae play fundamental role organizing multiple signaling pathways cell
