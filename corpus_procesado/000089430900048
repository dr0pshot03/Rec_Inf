patterning zebrafish retina wave sonic hedgehog activity
drosophila retina patterned morphogenetic wave driven hedgehog signaling protein hedgehog secreted first neurons induces neuronal differentiation hedgehog expression nearby uncommitted cells thereby propagating wave evidence presented zebrafish hedgehog homolog sonic hedgehog also expressed first retinal neurons sonic hedgehog drives wave neurogenesis across retina strikingly similar wave drosophila conservation patterning mechanism unexpected given highly divergent structures vertebrate invertebrate eyes supports common evolutionary origin animal visual system
