growth early continental crust controlled melting amphibolite subduction zones
thought first continental crust formed melting either eclogite amphibolite either subduction zones underside thick oceanic crust however observed compositions early crustal rocks experimental studies unable distinguish possibilities- show clear contrast trace-element ratios melts derived amphibolites eclogites partial melting low-magnesium amphibolite can explain low niobium/tantalum high zirconium/samarium ratios melts required early continental crust whereas melting eclogite indicates earliest continental crust formed melting amphibolites subductionzone environments melting eclogite magnesium-rich amphibolites lower part thick oceanic crust moreover low niobium/tantalum ratio seen subductionzone igneous rocks ages evidence melting rutile-eclogite never volumetrically important process
