structure function activator-induced conformations crsp coactivator
human cofactor complexes arc activator-recruited cofactor crsp cofactor required sp1 activation mediate activator-dependent transcription vitro although complexes share several common subunits structural functional relationships remain unknown report affinity-purified arc consists two distinct multisubunit complexes: larger complex denoted arc-l smaller coactivator crsp reconstituted vitro transcription biochemically separated arc-l crsp reveals differential cofactor functions arc-l complex transcriptionally inactive whereas crsp complex highly active structural determination electron microscopy em three-dimensional reconstruction indicate substantial differences size shape arc-l crsp moreover em analysis independently derived crsp complexes reveals distinct conformations induced different activators results suggest crsp may potentiate transcription via specific activator-induced conformational changes
