apobec- crystal structure functional implications deaminase aid 
apobec- apo2 belongs family apolipoprotein b messenger rna-editing enzyme catalytic apobec polypeptides deaminates mrna single-stranded dna12 different apobec members use deamination activity achieve diverse human biological functions deamination apobec protein called activation-induced cytidine deaminase aid critical generating high-affinity antibodies3 deamination apobec- proteins can inhibit retrotransposons replication retroviruses human immunodeficiency virus hepatitis b virus4- report crystal structure apo2 apo2 forms rod-shaped tetramer differs markedly square-shaped tetramer free nucleotide cytidine deaminase apobec proteins share considerable sequence homology apo2 two long alpha-helices monomer structure prevent formation square-shaped tetramer facilitate formation rod-shaped tetramer via head-to-head interactions two apo2 dimers extensive sequence homology among apobec family members allows us test apo2 structure-based predictions using aid show aid deamination activity impaired mutations predicted interfere oligomerization substrate access structure suggests mutations patients hyper-igm- syndrome inactivate aid resulting defective antibody maturation
