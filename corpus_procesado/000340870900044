histone h3 lysine-to-methionine mutants paradigm study chromatin signaling
histone h3 lysine-to-methionine h3k27m gain-of-function mutations occur highly aggressive pediatric gliomas established drosophila animal model pathogenic histone h3k27m mutation show overexpression resembles polycomb repressive complex prc2 loss-of-function phenotypes causing derepression prc2 target genes developmental perturbations similarly h3k9m mutant depletes h3k9 methylation levels suppresses position-effect variegation various drosophila tissues histone h3k9 demethylase kdm3b/jhdm2 associates h3k9m-containing nucleosomes misregulation drosophila results changes h3k9 methylation levels heterochromatic silencing defects established histone lysine-to-methionine mutants robust vivo tools inhibiting methylation pathways also function biochemical reagents capturing site-specific histone-modifying enzymes thus providing molecular insight chromatin signaling pathways
