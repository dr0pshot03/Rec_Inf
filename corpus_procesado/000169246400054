production multiple plant hormones single polyprotein precursor 
animal yeast hormone genes produce prohormone polypeptides proteolytically processed produce multiple copies hormones different functions1 plants four polypeptides identified can classed hormones2- intercellular chemical messengers6 none known produced multiple copies single precursor describe polyprotein hormone precursor present tobacco plants gives rise two polypeptide hormones often found animals yeast tobacco polypeptides activate synthesis defensive proteinase-inhibitor proteins manner similar systemin -amino-acid polypeptide found tomato plants2 two tobacco polypeptides derived end -amino-acid precursor bears homology tomato prosystemin data show structurally diverse polypeptide hormones different plant species can serve similar signalling roles condition found animals yeast
