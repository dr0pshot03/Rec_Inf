yeast rat1 exonuclease promotes transcription termination rna polymerase ii
carboxy-terminal domain ctd rna polymerase ii rnapii largest subunit consists multiple heptapeptide repeats consensus sequence ysptsps different ctd phosphorylation patterns act recognition sites binding various messenger rna processing factors thereby coupling transcription mrna processing polyadenylation factors co-transcriptionally recruited phosphorylation ctd serine ref factors also required transcription termination rnapii transcribes past polya site rna cleaved polyadenylation machinery rna downstream cleavage site degraded show rtt103 rat1/rai1 -> exonuclease localized ends protein coding genes rat1 rai1delta cells rna polyadenylation sites greatly stabilized termination defects seen many genes findings support model polya site cleavage subsequent degradation -downstream rna rat1 trigger transcription termination
