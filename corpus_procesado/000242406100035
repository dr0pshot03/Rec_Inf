macroscopic hierarchical surface patterning porphyrin trimers via self-assembly dewetting 
use bottom-up approaches construct patterned surfaces technological applications appealing date applicable relatively small areas similar square micrometers constructed highly periodic patterns macroscopic length scales range square millimeters combining self-assembly disk-like porphyrin dyes physical dewetting phenomena patterns consisted equidistant nanometer-wide lines spaced micrometers apart forming single porphyrin stacks containing millions molecules formed spontaneously upon drop-casting solution molecules onto mica surface glass thicker lines formed can used align liquid crystals large domains square millimeter size
