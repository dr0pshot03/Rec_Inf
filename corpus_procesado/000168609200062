pot1 putative telomere end-binding protein fission yeast humans 
telomere proteins ciliated protozoa bind single-stranded c-rich dna extensions ends macronuclear chromosomes now identified homologous proteins fission yeast humans pot1 protection telomeres proteins bind g-rich strand telomeric repeat sequence consistent direct role protecting chromosome ends deletion fission yeast pot1+ gene immediate effect chromosome stability causing rapid loss telomeric dna chromosome circularization now appears protein caps ends chromosomes widely dispersed throughout eukaryotic kingdom
