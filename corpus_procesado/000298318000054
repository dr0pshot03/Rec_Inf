compact system small planets around former red-giant star
planets orbit parent star less one astronomical unit au earth-sun distance expected engulfed star becomes red giant previous observations revealed existence post-red-giant host stars giant planets- orbiting close au brown dwarf companions tight orbits showing bodies can survive engulfment remained unclear whether planets can dragged deeper red-giant envelope without disrupted whether evolution parent star affected- report presence two nearly earth-sized bodies orbiting post-red-giant hot b subdwarf star kic distances au orbital periods hours respectively bodies probably survived deep immersion former red-giant envelope may dense cores evaporated giant planets transported closer star engulfment triggered mass loss necessary formation hot b subdwarf might also explain stars type form binary systems
