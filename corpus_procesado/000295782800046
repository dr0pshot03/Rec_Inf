self-replication information-bearing nanoscale patterns 
dna molecules provide probably iconic example self-replication-the ability system replicate make copies living cells process mediated enzymes occurs autonomously number replicas increasing exponentially time without need external manipulation self-replication also implemented synthetic systems including rna enzymes designed undergo self-sustained exponential amplification- exciting next step use self-replication materials fabrication requires robust general systems capable copying amplifying functional materials structures report first development direction using dna tile motifs can recognize bind complementary tiles pre-programmed fashion first design tile motifs form seven-tile seed sequence use seeds instruct formation first generation complementary seven-tile daughter sequences finally use daughters instruct formation seven-tile granddaughter sequences identical initial seed sequences considering dna functional material can organize molecules useful structures- findings raise tantalizing prospect may one day able realize self-replicating materials various patterns useful functions
