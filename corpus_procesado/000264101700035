self-repairing oxetane-substituted chitosan polyurethane networks 
polyurethanes many properties qualify high-performance polymeric materials still suffer mechanical damage report development polyurethane networks exhibit self-repairing characteristics upon exposure ultraviolet light network consists oxetane-substituted chitosan precursor incorporated two-component polyurethane upon mechanical damage network four-member oxetane rings open create two reactive ends exposed ultraviolet light chitosan chain scission occurs forms crosslinks reactive oxetane ends thus repairing network materials capable repairing less hour can used many coatings applications ranging transportation packaging fashion biomedical industries
