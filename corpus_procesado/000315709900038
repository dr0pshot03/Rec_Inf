superconducting circuits quantum information: outlook 
performance superconducting qubits improved several orders magnitude past decade circuits benefit robustness superconductivity josephson effect present encountered hard physical limits however building error-corrected information processor many qubits will require solving specific architecture problems constitute new field research first time physicists will master quantum error correction design operate complex active systems dissipative nature yet remain coherent indefinitely offer view directions field speculate future
