oncogene-induced senescence part tumorigenesis barrier imposed dna damage checkpoints 
recent studies indicated existence tumorigenesis barriers slow inhibit progression preneoplastic lesions neoplasia one barrier involves dna replication stress leads activation dna damage checkpoint thereby apoptosis cell cycle arrest whereas second barrier mediated oncogene-induced senescence- relationship two barriers elucidated show oncogene-induced senescence associated signs dna replication stress including prematurely terminated dna replication forks dna double-strand breaks inhibiting dna double-strand break response kinase ataxia telangiectasia mutated atm suppressed induction senescence mouse model led increased tumour size invasiveness analysis human precancerous lesions indicated dna damage senescence markers cosegregate closely thus senescence human preneoplastic lesions manifestation oncogene-induced dna replication stress together apoptosis provides barrier malignant progression
