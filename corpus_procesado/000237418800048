trehalose metabolic enzyme controls inflorescence architecture maize 
inflorescence branching major yield trait crop plants controlled developmental fate axillary shoot meristems variations branching patterns lead diversity flower-bearing architectures inflorescences affect crop yield influencing seed number harvesting ability several growth regulators auxins cytokinins carotenoid derivatives regulate branching architectures inflorescence branching maize regulated three ramosa genes show one genes ramosa3 ra3 encodes trehalose--phosphate phosphatase expressed discrete domains subtending axillary inflorescence meristems genetic molecular data indicate ra3 functions predicted transcriptional regulator ramosa1 ra1 propose ra3 regulates inflorescence branching modification sugar signal moves axillary meristems alternatively fact ra3 acts upstream ra1 supports hypothesis ra3 may transcriptional regulatory function
