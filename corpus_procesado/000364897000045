microrna-encoded behavior drosophila
relationship microrna mirna regulation specification behavior beginning explored found mutation single mirna locus mir-iab4/iab8 drosophila larvae affects animals capacity correct orientation turned upside self-righting one mirna targets involved behavior hox gene ultrabithorax whose derepression two metameric neurons leads self-righting defects vivo neural activity analysis reveals neurons self-righting node srn different activity patterns wild type mirna mutants whereas thermogenetic manipulation srn activity results changes self-righting behavior work thus reveals mirna-encoded behavior suggests mirnas might also involved behavioral control drosophila species
