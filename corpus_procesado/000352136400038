human-specific gene arhgap11b promotes basal progenitor amplification neocortex expansion 
evolutionary expansion human neocortex reflects increased amplification basal progenitors subventricular zone producing neurons fetal corticogenesis work analyze transcriptomes distinct progenitor subpopulations isolated cell polarity-based approach developing mouse human neocortex identify genes preferentially expressed human apical basal radial glia lack mouse orthologs among arhgap11b highest degree radial glia-specific expression arhgap11b arose partial duplication arhgap11a encodes rho guanosine triphosphatase-activating protein human lineage separation chimpanzee lineage expression arhgap11b embryonic mouse neocortex promotes basal progenitor generation self-renewal can increase cortical plate area induce gyrification hence arhgap11b may contributed evolutionary expansion human neocortex
