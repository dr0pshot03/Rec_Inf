explosive volcanism may inevitable consequence magma fragmentation 
fragmentation magma containing abundant gas bubbles thought defining characteristic explosive eruptions- viscous stresses associated growth bubbles flow ascending magma exceed strength melt- magma breaks disconnected fragments suspended within expanding gas phase although repeated effusive explosive eruptions individual volcanoes common dynamics governing transition explosive effusive eruptions remain unclear magmas types eruptions originate sources similar volatile content yet effusive lavas erupt considerably degassed explosive counterparts one mechanism degassing magma ascent consistent observations generation intermittent permeable fracture networks generated non-explosive fragmentation near conduit walls- show fragmentation can occur viscous shear effusive explosive eruptions moreover suggest fragmentation may important magma degassing inhibition explosive behaviour implies contrary conventional views explosive volcanism inevitable consequence magma fragmentation
