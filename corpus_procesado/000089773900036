prototype systems rechargeable magnesium batteries
thermodynamic properties magnesium make natural choice use anode material rechargeable batteries may provide considerably higher energy density commonly used lead-acid nickel-cadmium systems moreover contrast lead cadmium magnesium inexpensive environmentally friendly safe handle development mg batteries hindered two problems first owing chemical activity mg solutions neither donate accept protons suitable electrolytes solutions allow growth passivating surface films inhibit electrochemical reaction- second choice cathode materials limited difficulty intercalating mg ions many hosts following previous studies electrochemistry mg electrodes various non-aqueous solutions variety intercalation electrodes now developed rechargeable mg battery systems show promise applications systems comprise electrolyte solutions based mg organohaloaluminate salts mgxmo3s4 cathodes mg ions can intercalated reversibly relatively fast kinetics expect improvements energy density will make batteries viable alternative existing systems
