intratumor heterogeneity localized lung adenocarcinomas delineated multiregion sequencing 
cancers composed populations cells distinct molecular phenotypic features phenomenon termed intratumor heterogeneity ith ith lung cancers well studied applied multiregion whole-exome sequencing wes localized lung adenocarcinomas tumors showed clear evidence ith average % mutations known cancer gene mutations identified regions individual tumors suggested single-region sequencing may adequate identify majority known cancer gene mutations localized lung adenocarcinomas median follow-up months surgery three patients relapsed three patients significantly larger fractions subclonal mutations primary tumors patients without relapse data indicate larger subclonal mutation fraction may associated increased likelihood postsurgical relapse patients localized lung adenocarcinomas
