bedrock fracture ice segregation cold regions
volumetric expansion freezing pore water widely assumed major cause rock fracture cold humid regions data experiments simulating natural freezing regimes indicate bedrock fracture results instead ice segregation fracture depth timing also numerically simulated coupling heat mass transfer fracture model depth geometry fractures match arctic permafrost ice-age weathering profiles agreement supports conceptual model ice segregation near-surface permafrost leads progressively rock fracture heave whereas permafrost degradation leads episodically melt segregated ice rock settlement
