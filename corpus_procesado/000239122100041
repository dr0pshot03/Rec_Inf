transcriptional repressor jhdm3a demethylates trimethyl histone h3 lysine lysine
post-translational modification chromatin profound effects many biological processes including transcriptional regulation heterochromatin organization x-chromosome inactivation recent studies indicate methylation specific histone lysine k residues participates many processes lysine methylation occurs three distinct states either one me1 two me2 three me3 methyl groups attached amine group lysine side chain differences modification state important role defining methylated chromatin recognized interpreted- recently histone lysine methylation considered stable modification identification histone demethylase enzymes demonstrated reversibility epigenetic mark- far characterized histone demethylases show enzymatic activity towards lysine residues modified me1 me2 state- leaving open possibility me3 constitutes irreversible modification demonstrate jhdm3a jumonji c jmjc domain-containing histone demethylase 3a also known jmjd2a capable removing me3 group modified h3 lysine h3k9 h3 lysine h3k36 overexpression jhdm3a abrogates recruitment hp1 heterochromatin protein heterochromatin indicating role jhdm3a antagonizing methylated h3k9 nucleated events sirna-mediated knockdown jhdm3a leads increased levels h3k9 methylation upregulation jhdm3a target gene ascl2 indicating jhdm3a may function euchromatin remove histone methylation marks associated active transcription
