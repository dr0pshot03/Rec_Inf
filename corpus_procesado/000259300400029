polymer pen lithography 
report low cost high throughput scanning probe lithography method uses soft elastomeric tip array rather tips mounted individual cantilevers deliver inks surface direct write manner polymer pen lithography merges feature size control dip pen nanolithography large area capability contact printing ink delivery time force dependent features nanometer micrometer macroscopic length scales can formed tip array arrays many million pyramid shaped pens can brought contact substrates readily leveled optically ensure uniform pattern development
