genomic determinants coral heat tolerance across latitudes 
global warming continues reef-building corals avoid local population declines "genetic rescue" involving exchange heat-tolerant genotypes across latitudes latitudinal variation thermal tolerance heritable show up-to--fold increase odds survival coral larvae heat stress parents come warmer lower-latitude location elevated thermal tolerance associated heritable differences expression oxidative extracellular transport andmitochondrial functions indicated lack prior stress moreover two genomic regions strongly responded selection thermal tolerance interlatitudinal crosses results demonstrate variation coral thermal tolerance across latitudes strong genetic basis serve raw material natural selection
