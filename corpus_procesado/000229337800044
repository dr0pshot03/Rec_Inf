arabidopsis f-box protein tir1 auxin receptor
despite years evidence showing pivotal role indole--acetic acid iaa auxin plant development mechanism auxin perception remained elusive central auxin response changes gene expression brought auxin-induced interaction aux/iaa transcriptional repressor proteins ubiquitin ligase complex scftir1 thus targeting proteolysis regulated scf-mediated protein degradation widely occurring signal transduction mechanism target specificity conferred f-box protein subunit scf tir1 case aux/iaas multiple f-box protein genes eukaryotic genomes examined far although scf target interaction usually regulated signal-induced modification target previously shown auxin signalling involves modification scftir1 show modification involves direct binding auxin tir1 thus tir1 auxin receptor mediating transcriptional responses auxin
