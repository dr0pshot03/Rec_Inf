molecular signals epigenetic states 
epigenetic signals responsible establishment maintenance reversal metastable transcriptional states fundamental cells ability remember past events changes external environment developmental cues complex epigenetic states orchestrated several converging reinforcing signals including transcription factors noncoding rnas dna methylation histone modifications although pathways modulate transcription chromatin vivo mechanisms epigenetic information transmitted cell division remain unclear epigenetic states metastable change response appropriate signals deeper understanding molecular framework will allow us tackle dysregulation epigenetics disease
