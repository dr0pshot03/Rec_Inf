increasing p16ink4a expression decreases forebrain progenitors neurogenesis ageing
mammalian ageing associated reduced regenerative capacity tissues contain stem cells proposed least partially caused senescence progenitors age however yet tested whether genes associated senescence functionally contribute physiological declines progenitor activity show progenitor proliferation subventricular zone neurogenesis olfactory bulb well multipotent progenitor frequency self-renewal potential decline age mouse forebrain declines progenitor frequency function correlate increased expression p16ink4a encodes cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor linked senescence ageing p16ink4a-deficient mice showed significantly smaller decline subventricular zone proliferation olfactory bulb neurogenesis frequency self-renewal potential multipotent progenitors p16ink4a deficiency detectably affect progenitor function dentate gyrus enteric nervous system indicating regional differences response neural progenitors increased p16ink4a expression ageing declining subventricular zone progenitor function olfactory bulb neurogenesis ageing thus caused partly increasing p16ink4a expression
