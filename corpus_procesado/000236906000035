chromosome unusual among human chromosomes many respects largest human autosome orthology single mouse chromosome mapping entirely distal half mouse chromosome chromosome rich protein-coding genes second highest gene density genome also enriched segmental duplications ranking third density among autosomes report finished sequence human chromosome well structural comparison finished sequence mouse chromosome first finished mouse chromosome comparison orthologous regions reveals striking differences contrast typical pattern seen mammalian evolution human sequence undergone extensive intrachromosomal rearrangement whereas mouse sequence remarkably stable moreover although human sequence high density segmental duplication mouse sequence low density notably segmental duplications correspond closely sites structural rearrangement demonstrating link duplication rearrangement examination main classes duplicated segments provides insight dynamics underlying expansion chromosome-specific low-copy repeats human genome
