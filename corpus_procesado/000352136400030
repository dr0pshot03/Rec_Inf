bee declines driven combined stress parasites pesticides lack flowers 
bees subject numerous pressures modern world abundance diversity flowers declined; bees chronically exposed cocktails agrochemicals simultaneously exposed novel parasites accidentally spread humans climate change likely exacerbate problems future stressors act isolation; example pesticide exposure can impair detoxification mechanisms immune responses rendering bees susceptible parasites seems certain chronic exposure multiple interacting stressors driving honey bee colony losses declines wild pollinators interactions addressed current regulatory procedures studying interactions experimentally poses major challenge meantime taking steps reduce stress bees seem prudent; incorporating flower-rich habitat farmland reducing pesticide use adopting sustainable farming methods enforcing effective quarantine measures bee movements practical measures adopted effective monitoring wild pollinator populations urgently needed inform management strategies future
