umpolung reactivity amide peptide synthesis 
amide bond one natures common functional structural elements backbones natural peptides proteins composed amide bonds amides also present many therapeutic small molecules construction amide bonds using available methods relies principally dehydrative approaches although oxidative radical-based methods representative alternatives nearly every example carbon nitrogen bear electrophilic nucleophilic character respectively carbon-nitrogen bond-forming step show activation amines nitroalkanes electrophilic iodine source can lead directly amide products preliminary observations support mechanism polarities two reactants reversed german umpolung carbon-nitrogen bond formation relative traditional approaches use nitroalkanes acyl anion equivalents provides conceptually innovative approach amide peptide synthesis one might ultimately provide efficient peptide synthesis fully reliant enantioselective methods
