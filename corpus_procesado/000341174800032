solar-mass black hole galaxy m82 
m82 x- brightest x-ray source galaxy m82 thought intermediate-mass black hole solar masses extremely high luminosity variability characteristics- although models suggest mass may solar masses previous mass estimates based scaling relations use low-frequency characteristic time-scales large intrinsic uncertainties stellar-mass black holes know high-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations hertz x-ray emission occur : frequency ratio stable scale frequency inversely black hole mass reasonably small dispersion- discovery stable oscillations thus potentially offers alternative less ambiguous means mass determination intermediate-mass black holes hitherto realized report stable twin-peak : frequency ratio x-ray quasi-periodic oscillations m82 x frequencies +/- hertz +/- hertz assuming can extrapolate inverse-mass scaling holds stellar-mass black holes estimate black hole mass m82 x +/ solar masses addition can estimate mass using relativistic precession model get value +/ solar masses
