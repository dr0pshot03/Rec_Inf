non-volcanic tremor low-frequency earthquake swarms 
non-volcanic tremor weak extended duration seismic signal observed episodically major faults often conjunction slow slip events1- tremor may hold key understanding fundamental processes deep roots faults signal times accelerated slip hence increased seismic hazard mechanism underlying generation tremor relationship aseismic slip however yet unresolved demonstrate tremor beneath shikoku japan can explained swarm small low-frequency earthquakes occurs shear faulting subduction-zone plate interface suggests tremor slow slip different manifestations single process
