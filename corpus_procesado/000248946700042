anatomy dynamics supramolecular membrane protein cluster
plasmalemmal proteins organize submicrometer-sized clusters whose architecture dynamics still enigmatic syntaxin example applied combination far-field optical nanoscopy biochemistry fluorescence recovery photobleaching frap analysis simulations show clustering can explained self-organization based simple physical principles average syntaxin clusters exhibit diameter nanometers contain densely crowded syntaxins dynamically exchange freely diffusing molecules self-association depends weak homophilic protein-protein interactions simulations suggest clustering immobilizes conformationally constrains molecules moreover balance self-association crowding-induced steric repulsions sufficient explain size dynamics syntaxin clusters likely many oligomerizing membrane proteins form supramolecular structures
