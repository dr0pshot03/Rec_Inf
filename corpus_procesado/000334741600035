herbivores nutrients control grassland plant diversity via light limitation 
human alterations nutrient cycles herbivore communities- affecting global biodiversity dramatically ecological theory predicts changes strongly counteractive: nutrient addition drives plant species loss intensified competition light whereas herbivores prevent competitive exclusion increasing ground-level light particularly productive systems use experimental data spanning globally relevant range conditions test hypothesis herbaceous plant species losses caused eutrophication may offset increased light availability due herbivory experiment replicated grasslands continents demonstrates nutrients herbivores can serve counteracting forces control local plant diversity light limitation independent site productivity soil nitrogen herbivore type climate nutrient addition consistently reduced local diversity light limitation herbivory rescued diversity sites alleviated light limitation thus species loss anthropogenic eutrophication can ameliorated grasslands herbivory increases ground-level light
