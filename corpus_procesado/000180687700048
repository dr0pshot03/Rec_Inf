spongiform degeneration mahoganoid mutant mice 
mahoganoid mouse coat-color mutation whose pigmentary phenotype genetic interactions resemble attractin atrn atrn mutations also cause spongiform neurodegeneration show null mutation mahoganoid causes similar age-dependent neuropathology includes many features prion diseases without accumulation protease-resistant prion protein gene mutated mahoganoid encodes ring-containing protein e3 ubiquitin ligase activity vitro similarities phenotype expression genetic interactions suggest mahoganoid atrn genes part conserved pathway regulated protein turnover whose function essential neuronal viability
