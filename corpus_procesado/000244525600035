bipolar supercurrent graphene 
graphene recently discovered form graphite one atomic layer thick constitutes new model system condensed matter physics first material charge carriers behave massless chiral relativistic particles anomalous quantization hall conductance now understood theoretically one experimental signatures peculiar transport properties relativistic electrons graphene unusual phenomena like finite conductivity order 4e/h e electron charge h plancks constant charge neutrality dirac point come surprise remain explained- experimentally study josephson effect mesoscopic junctions consisting graphene layer contacted two closely spaced superconducting electrodes charge density graphene layer can controlled means gate electrode observe supercurrent depending gate voltage carried either electrons conduction band holes valence band importantly find normal state conductance graphene finite also finite supercurrent can flow zero charge density observations shed light special role time reversal symmetry graphene demonstrate phase coherent electronic transport dirac point
