directionally selective calcium signals dendrites starburst amacrine cells
detection image motion fundamental vision many species unique classes retinal ganglion cells selectively respond visual stimuli move specific directions known retinal cell first performs neural computations give rise directional selectivity ganglion cell prominent candidate interneuron called starburst amacrine cell using two-photon optical recordings intracellular calcium concentration find individual dendritic branches starburst cells act independent computation modules dendritic calcium signals somatic membrane voltage directionally selective stimuli move centrifugally cell soma demonstrates direction selectivity computed locally dendritic branches stage ganglion cells
