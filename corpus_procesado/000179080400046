fossil echinoderms monitor mg/ca ratio phanerozoic oceans
opinion long divided whether mg/ca ratio seawater remained constant phanerozoic underwent substantial secular change existing empirical evidence mg/ca ancient seawater provides poorly resolved often controversial signal echinoderm fossils retained bulk original chemistry despite micrometer-scale changes preserve record seawater mg/ca confirm major changes mg/ca occurred phanerozoic echinoderms cambrian carboniferous triassic indicate seawater mg/ca whereas echinoderms jurassic cretaceous indicate mg/ca present seawater mg/ca
