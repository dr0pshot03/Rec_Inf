arabidopsis type metacaspases control cell death
metacaspases distant relatives animal caspases found protozoa fungi plants limited experimental data exist defining functions despite discovery homology modeling decade ago demonstrated two type metacaspases atmc1 atmc2 antagonistically control programmed cell death arabidopsis atmc1 positive regulator cell death requires conserved caspase-like putative catalytic residues function atmc2 negatively regulates cell death function independent putative catalytic residues manipulation arabidopsis type metacaspase regulatory module can nearly eliminate hypersensitive cell death response hr activated plant intracellular immune receptors lead enhanced pathogen proliferation decoupling hr restriction pathogen growth
