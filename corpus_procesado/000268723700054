alternative dna structure necessary pilin antigenic variation neisseria gonorrhoeae 
pathogens can use dna recombination promote antigenic variation av surface structures avoid immune detection identified cis-acting dna sequence near antigenically variable pilin locus human pathogen neisseria gonorrhoeae base pair guanine g-rich sequence required pilin av formed guanine quartet g4 structure vitro individual mutations disrupted structure also blocked pilin av prevented nicks required recombination occurring within g4 region compound binds stabilizes g4 structures also inhibited pilin av prevented nicks occurring g-rich strand site constitutes recombination initiation sequence/structure directs gene conversion specific chromosomal locus
