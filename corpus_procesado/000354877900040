dominant role semi-arid ecosystems trend variability land co2 sink 
growth rate atmospheric carbon dioxide co2 concentrations since industrialization characterized large interannual variability mostly resulting variability co2 uptake terrestrial ecosystems typically termed carbon sink however contributions regional ecosystems variability well known using ensemble ecosystem land-surface models empirical observation-based product global gross primary production show mean sink trend interannual variability co2 uptake terrestrial ecosystems dominated distinct biogeographic regions whereas mean sink dominated highly productive lands mainly tropical forests trend interannual variability sink dominated semi arid ecosystems whose carbon balance strongly associated circulation driven variations precipitation temperature
