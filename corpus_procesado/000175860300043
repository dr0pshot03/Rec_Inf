component innate immunity prevents bacterial biofilm development
antimicrobial factors form one arm innate immune system protects mucosal surfaces bacterial infection- factors can rapidly kill bacteria deposited mucosal surfaces prevent acute invasive infections- many chronic infections however bacteria live biofilms distinct matrix-encased communities specialized surface persistence- transition free-living independent existence biofilm lifestyle can devastating biofilms notoriously resist killing host defence mechanisms antibiotics hypothesized innate immune system possesses specific activity protect biofilm infections show lactoferrin ubiquitous abundant constituent human external secretions blocks biofilm development opportunistic pathogen pseudomonas aeruginosa occurs lactoferrin concentrations kill prevent growth chelating iron lactoferrin stimulates twitching specialized form surface motility causing bacteria wander across surface instead forming cell clusters biofilms findings reveal specific anti-biofilm defence mechanism acting critical juncture biofilm development time bacteria stop roaming individuals aggregate durable communities
