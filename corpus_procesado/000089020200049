apc tumour suppressor nuclear export function 
adenomatous polpyposis coli apc protein mutated colorectal tumours nearly apc mutations truncations many terminate mutation cluster region located halfway protein- cancer cells expressing mutant apc beta-catenin stabilized translocates nucleus act transcriptional co-activator t-cell factor normal development apc also promotes destabilization beta-catenin drosophila armadillo- binding axin complex earmarks beta-catenin/armadillo degradation proteasome pathway apc regulatory role process poorly understood show apc contains highly conserved nuclear export signals adjacent mutation cluster region enable exit nucleus ability lost apc mutant cancer cells provide evidence beta-catenin accumulates nucleus result thus ability apc exit nucleus appears critical tumour suppressor function
