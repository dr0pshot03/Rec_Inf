oxidation guanine nucleotide pool underlies cell death bactericidal antibiotics 
detailed understanding mechanisms underlie antibiotic killing important derivation new classes antibiotics clinically useful adjuvants current antimicrobial therapies efforts understand dinb dna polymerase iv overproduction cytotoxic escherichia coli led unexpected insight oxidation guanine -oxo-guanine nucleotide pool underlies much cell death caused dinb overproduction bactericidal antibiotics propose model cytotoxicity beta-lactams quinolones predominantly results lethal double-strand dna breaks caused incomplete repair closely spaced -oxo-deoxyguanosine lesions whereas cytotoxicity aminoglycosides might additionally result mistranslation due incorporation -oxo-guanine newly synthesized rnas
