excitatory cortical neurons form fine-scale functional networks 
specificity cortical neuron connections creates columns functionally similar neurons spanning pia white matter- investigate whether additional finer level specificity creates subnetworks excitatory neurons within functional columns tested fine-scale specificity connections cortical layer / pyramidal neurons rat visual cortex using cross-correlation analyses synaptic currents evoked photostimulation recording simultaneously adjacent layer / pyramidal cells find connected % recorded pairs share common input layer within layer / adjacent layer / neurons connected share little common excitatory input layers / contrast layer / neurons share common excitatory input layer inhibitory input layers / regardless whether connected thus excitatory connections layer layer / within layer / form fine-scale assemblies selectively interconnected neurons inhibitory connections excitatory connections layer link neurons across fine-scale subnetworks relatively independent subnetworks excitatory neurons therefore embedded within larger-scale functional architecture allows neighbouring neurons convey information independently suggested previous descriptions cortical circuitry
