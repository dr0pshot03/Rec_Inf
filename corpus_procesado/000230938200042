discovery high energy gamma rays associated x-ray binary
x-ray binaries composed normal star orbit around neutron star stellar-mass black hole radio x-ray observations led presumption x-ray binaries called microquasars behave scaled-down active galactic nuclei microquasars resolved radio emission thought arise relativistic outflow akin active galactic nuclei jets particles can accelerated large energies high energy gamma-rays produced interactions particles observed several active galactic nuclei using high energy stereoscopic system find evidence gamma-ray emission > gigaelectron volts candidate microquasar ls showing particles also accelerated high energies systems
