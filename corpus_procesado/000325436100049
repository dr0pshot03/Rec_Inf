genome-wide signatures convergent evolution echolocating mammals 
evolution typically thought proceed divergence genes proteins ultimately phenotypes1- however similar traits might also evolve convergently unrelated taxa owing similar selection pressures45 adaptive phenotypic convergence widespread nature recent results several genes suggested phenomenon powerful enough also drive recurrent evolution sequence level6- homoplasious substitutions occur long considered result neutral processes however recent studies demonstrated adaptive convergent sequence evolution can detected vertebrates using statistical methods model parallel evolution910 although extent sequence convergence genera occurs across genomes unknown analyse genomic sequence data mammals independently evolved echolocation show convergence rare process restricted several loci instead widespread continuously distributed commonly driven natural selection acting small number sites per locus systematic analyses convergent sequence evolution amino acids within orthologous coding gene sequences compared across mammals including four newly sequenced bat genomes revealed signatures consistent convergence nearly loci strong significant support convergence among bats bottlenose dolphin seen numerous genes linked hearing deafness consistent involvement echolocation unexpectedly also found convergence many genes linked vision: convergent signal many sensory genes robustly correlated strength natural selection first attempt detect genome-wide convergent sequence evolution across divergent taxa reveals phenomenon much pervasive previously recognized
