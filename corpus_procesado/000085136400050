subclass ras proteins regulate degradation kappa b 
small guanosine triphosphatases typified mammalian ras proteins play major roles regulation numerous cellular pathways subclass evolutionarily conserved ras-like proteins identified members differ ras proteins containing amino acids positions similar present oncogenic forms ras proteins kappa b-ras1 kappa b-ras2 interact pest domains kappa b alpha kappa b beta [inhibitors transcription factor nuclear factor kappa b nf-kappa b] decrease rate degradation cells kappa b-ras proteins associated nf-kappa b:i kappa b beta complexes therefore may provide explanation slower rate degradation kappa b beta compared kappa b alpha
