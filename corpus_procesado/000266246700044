phasic firing dopaminergic neurons sufficient behavioral conditioning
natural rewards drugs abuse can alter dopamine signaling ventral tegmental area vta dopaminergic neurons known fire action potentials tonically phasically different behavioral conditions however without technology control specific neurons appropriate temporal precision freely behaving mammals causal role action potential patterns driving behavioral changes unclear used optogenetic tools selectively stimulate vta dopaminergic neuron action potential firing freely behaving mammals found phasic activation neurons sufficient drive behavioral conditioning elicited dopamine transients magnitudes achieved longer lower-frequency spiking results demonstrate phasic dopaminergic activity sufficient mediate mammalian behavioral conditioning
