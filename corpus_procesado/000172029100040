absolute-phase phenomena photoionization few-cycle laser pulses 
currently shortest laser pulses can generated visible spectrum consist fewer two optical cycles measured full-width half-maximum pulses envelope time variation electric field pulse depends phase carrier frequency respect envelope absolute phase intense laser-matter interactions generally depend electric field pulse absolute phase important number nonlinear processes- clear evidence absolute-phase effects yet detected experimentally largely difficulty stabilizing absolute phase powerful laser pulses use technique require phase stabilization demonstrate experimentally influence absolute phase short laser pulse emission photoelectrons atoms ionized short laser pulse photoelectrons recorded two opposing detectors plane perpendicular laser beam detect anticorrelation shot-to-shot analysis electron yield
