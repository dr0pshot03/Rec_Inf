subatomic resolution force microscopy reveals internal structure adsorption sites small iron clusters 
clusters built individual iron atoms adsorbed surfaces adatoms investigated atomic force microscopy afm subatomic resolution single copper iron adatoms appeared toroidal structures multiatom clusters connected structures showing individual atom torus single adatoms toroidal shape afm image depends bonding symmetry adatom underlying structure [ twofold copper copper threefold iron copper] density functional theory calculations support experimental data findings correct previous work multiple minima afm signal interpreted reflection orientation single front atom suggest dual triple minima force signal caused dimer trimer tips respectively
