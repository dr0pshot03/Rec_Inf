aridification sahara desert caused tethys sea shrinkage late miocene 
widely believed sahara desert similar -million years myr old geological evidence showing remarkable aridification north africa onset quaternary ice ages- time north african aridity mainly controlled african summer monsoon asm- oscillated earths orbital precession cycles afterwards northern hemisphere glaciation added ice volume forcing asm additionally oscillated glacial-interglacial cycles findings led idea sahara desert came existence northern hemisphere glaciated similar myr ago later discovery however aeolian dune deposits similar myr old suggested much older age although interpretation hotly challenged clear mechanism aridification around time use climate model simulations identify tortonian stage similar myr ago late miocene epoch pivotal period triggering north african aridity creating sahara desert set experiments norwegian earth system model community atmosphere model demonstrate african summer monsoon drastically weakened tethys sea shrinkage tortonian allowing arid desert conditions expand across north africa tethys shrinkage alter mean climate region also enhanced sensitivity african monsoon orbital forcing subsequently became major driver sahara extent fluctuations important climatic changes probably caused shifts asian african flora fauna observed period- possible links emergence early hominins north africa
