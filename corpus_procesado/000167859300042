extreme damping composite materials negative-stiffness inclusions 
force deforms elastic object practical experience suggests resulting displacement will direction force property known positive stiffness less familiar concept negative stiffness deforming force resulting displacement opposite directions negative stiffness distinct negative poissons ratio- refers occurrence lateral expansion upon stretching object negative stiffness can occur example deforming object stored supplied energy property usually unstable shown theoretically inclusions negative stiffness can stabilized within positive-stiffness matrix describe experimental realization composite approach embedding negative-stiffness inclusions ferroelastic vanadium dioxide pure tin matrix resulting composites exhibit extreme mechanical damping large anomalies stiffness consequence high local strains result inclusions deforming composite whole moreover certain temperature ranges negative-stiffness inclusions effective diamond inclusions increasing overall composite stiffness expect composites useful high damping materials stiff structural elements actuator-type applications
