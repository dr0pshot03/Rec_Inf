hydrophobicity janus interface 
water confined adjoining hydrophobic hydrophilic surfaces janus interface found form stable films nanometer thickness whose responses shear deformations extraordinarily noisy power spectrum noise quantified addition frequency dependence complex shear modulus power law slope one-half indicating distribution relaxation processes rather dominant one physical picture emerges whereas surface energetics encourage water dewet hydrophobic side interface hydrophilic side constrains water present resulting flickering fluctuating complex
