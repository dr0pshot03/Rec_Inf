thermohaline fine structure oceanographic front seismic reflection profiling 
present acoustic images oceanic thermohaline structure created marine seismic reflection profiles across major oceanographic front labrador current north atlantic current images show distinct water masses can mapped internal structure imaged using low frequency acoustic reflections sound speed contrasts interfaces across temperature changes warm/cold front characterized east-dipping reflections generated thermohaline intrusions uppermost meters ocean results imply marine seismic reflection techniques can provide excellent spatial resolution important oceanic phenomena including thermohaline intrusions internal waves eddies
