coherent intrachain energy migration conjugated polymer room temperature 
intermediate coupling regime electronic energy transfer particular interest excitation moves space classical hopping mechanism quantum phase information conserved conducted ultrafast polarization experiment specifically designed observe quantum coherent dynamics regime conjugated polymer samples different chain conformations examined model multichromophoric systems data recorded room temperature reveal coherent intrachain interchain electronic energy transfer results suggest quantum transport effects occur room temperature chemical donor-acceptor bonds help correlate dephasing perturbations
