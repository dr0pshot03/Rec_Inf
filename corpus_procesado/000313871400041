apoptotic cell clearance bronchial epithelial cells critically influences airway inflammation 
lung epithelial cells can influence immune responses airway allergens airway epithelial cells also undergo apoptosis encountering environmental allergens yet relatively little known cleared effect airway inflammation show airway epithelial cells efficiently engulf apoptotic epithelial cells secrete anti-inflammatory cytokines dependent upon intracellular signalling small gtpase rac1 inducible deletion rac1 expression specifically airway epithelial cells mouse model resulted defective engulfment epithelial cells aberrant anti-inflammatory cytokine production intranasal priming challenge mice house dust mite extract ovalbumin allergens led exacerbated inflammation augmented th2 cytokines airway hyper-responsiveness decreased interleukin il bronchial lavages rac1-deficient epithelial cells produced much higher il upon allergen apoptotic cell encounter increased numbers nuocyte-like cells administration exogenous il rescued airway inflammation phenotype rac1-deficient mice decreased il- collectively genetic functional studies suggest new role rac1-dependent engulfment airway epithelial cells establishing anti-inflammatory environment defects cell clearance airways contribute inflammatory responses towards common allergens
