divergence transcription factor binding sites across related yeast species 
characterization interspecies differences gene regulation crucial understanding molecular basis phenotypic diversity evolution means chromatin immunoprecipitation dna microarray analysis divergence binding sites pseudohyphal regulators ste12 tec1 determined yeasts saccharomyces cerevisiae s mikatae s bayanus pseudohyphal conditions shown sites diverged across species far exceeding interspecies variation orthologous genes group ste12 targets shown bound s mikatae s bayanus pseudohyphal conditions many genes targets ste12 mating s cerevisiae indicating specialization two pathways occurred species transcription factor binding sites therefore diverged substantially faster ortholog content thus gene regulation resulting transcription factor binding likely major cause divergence related species
