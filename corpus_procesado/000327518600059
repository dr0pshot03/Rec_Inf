primate transcript protein expression levels evolve compensatory selection pressures 
changes gene regulation likely played important role evolution primates differences messenger rna mrna expression levels across primates often documented; however yet known extent measurements divergence mrna levels reflect divergence protein expression levels probably important determining phenotypic differences used high-resolution quantitative mass spectrometry collect protein expression measurements human chimpanzee rhesus macaque lymphoblastoid cell lines compared transcript expression data samples found dozens genes significant expression differences species mrna level yet little difference protein expression overall data suggest protein expression levels evolve stronger evolutionary constraint mrna levels
