room-temperature solid-state maser 
invention laser resulted many innovations device become ubiquitous however maser amplifies microwave radiation rather visible light large impact despite instrumental lasers birth12 masers relative obscurity mainly due inconvenience operating conditions needed various realizations: atomic3 free-electron4 masers require vacuum chambers pumping; solid-state masers5 although excel low-noise amplifiers6 occasionally incorporated ultrastable oscillators78 typically require cryogenic refrigeration realizations masers also require strong magnets magnetic shielding overcoming various obstacles pave way improvements more-sensitive chemical assays more-precise determinations biomolecular structure function more-accurate medical diagnostics including tomography based enhanced magnetic resonance spectrometers9 incorporating maser amplifiers oscillators report experimental demonstration solid-state maser operating room temperature pulsed mode works laboratory bench air terrestrial magnetic field amplifies around gigahertz contrast cryogenic ruby maser6 maser gain medium organic mixed molecular crystal p-terphenyl doped pentacene latter photo-excited yellow light masers pumping mechanism exploits spin-selective molecular intersystem crossing10 pentacenes triplet ground state1112 configured oscillator solid-state masers measured output power around decibel milliwatts approximately million times greater atomic hydrogen maser3 oscillates similar frequency gigahertz exploiting high levels spin polarization readily generated intersystem crossing photo-excited pentacene aromatic molecules new type maser seems capable amplifying residual noise temperature far room temperature
