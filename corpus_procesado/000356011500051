correlated gene expression supports synchronous activity brain networks
rest brain activity synchronized different regions widely distributed throughout brain forming functional networks however molecular mechanisms supporting functional connectivity remain undefined show functional brain networks defined resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging can recapitulated using measures correlated gene expression post mortem brain tissue data set set genes identify significantly enriched ion channels polymorphisms set genes significantly affect resting-state functional connectivity large sample healthy adolescents expression levels genes also significantly associated axonal connectivity mouse results provide convergent multimodal evidence resting-state functional networks correlate orchestrated activity dozens genes linked ion channel activity synaptic function
