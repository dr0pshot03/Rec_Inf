articulated palaeozoic fossil plates greatly expands disparity early chitons
modern chitons mollusca: polyplacophora possess highly conserved skeleton eight shell plates valves surrounded spicules scales fossil evidence suggests chiton skeleton changed little since first appearance class late cambrian period million years present myr bp however palaeozoic problematic taxon multiplacophora- spite complex skeleton shares several derived characters chitons enigmatic status multiplacophora due part fact members exoskeleton numerous calcium carbonate valves usually separated death new articulated specimen carboniferous period myr bp indiana reveals multiplacophorans dorsal protective surface composed head tail valves left right columns overlapping valves five side central zone five smaller valves surrounded annulus large spines describe name articulated specimen present evidence multiplacophorans chitons thus highly conserved body plan living chitons belies broad disparity clade palaeozoic era
