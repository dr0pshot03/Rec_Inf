molecular ordering organic molten salts triggered single-walled carbon nanotubes
mixed imidazolium ion-based room-temperature ionic liquid pristine single-walled carbon nanotubes formed gels ground heavily entangled nanotube bundles found untangle within gel form much finer bundles phase transition rheological properties suggest gels formed physical cross-linking nanotube bundles mediated local molecular ordering ionic liquids rather entanglement nanotubes gels thermally stable shrivel even reduced pressure resulting nonvolatility ionic liquids readily undergo gel-to-solid transition absorbent materials use polymerizable ionic liquid gelling medium allows fabrication highly electroconductive polymer/ nanotube composite material showed substantial enhancement dynamic hardness
