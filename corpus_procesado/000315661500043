activating rnas associate mediator enhance chromatin architecture transcription 
recent advances genomic research revealed existence large number transcripts devoid protein-coding potential multiple organisms- although functional role long non-coding rnas lncrnas best defined epigenetic phenomena x-chromosome inactivation imprinting different classes lncrnas may varied biological functions- others identified class lncrnas termed ncrna-activating ncrna-a function activate neighbouring genes using cis-mediated mechanism- define precise mode enhancer-like rnas function depleted factors known roles transcriptional activation assessed role rna-dependent activation report depletion components co-activator complex mediator specifically potently diminished ncrna-induced activation transcription heterologous reporter assay using human hek293 cells vivo mediator recruited ncrna-a target genes regulates expression show ncrna-a interact mediator regulate chromatin localization kinase activity towards histone h3 serine mediator complex harbouring disease-causing med12 mutations displays diminished ability associate activating ncrnas chromosome conformation capture confirmed presence dna looping ncrna-a loci targets importantly depletion mediator subunits ncrna-a reduced chromatin looping two loci results identify human mediator complex transducer activating ncrnas highlight importance mediator activating ncrna association human disease
