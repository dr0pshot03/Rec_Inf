non-equilibrium coherence dynamics one-dimensional bose gases
low-dimensional systems provide beautiful examples many-body quantum physics one-dimensional 1d systems luttinger liquid approach provides insight universal properties much known equilibrium state weakly- strongly interacting regimes however remains challenge probe dynamics equilibrium state reached present direct experimental study coherence dynamics isolated coupled degenerate 1d bose gases dynamic splitting used create two 1d systems phase coherent state time evolution coherence revealed local phase shifts subsequently observed interference patterns completely isolated 1d bose gases observed exhibit universal sub-exponential coherence decay excellent agreement recent predictions two coupled 1d bose gases coherence factor observed approach non-zero equilibrium value predicted bogoliubov approach coupled-system decay finite coherence matter wave equivalent phase-locking two lasers injection non-equilibrium dynamics superfluids important role wide range physical systems superconductors quantum hall systems superfluid helium spin systems- experiments studying coherence dynamics show 1d bose gases ideally suited investigating class phenomena
