observation ultralong-range rydberg molecules 
rydberg atoms electron state high principal quantum number result can exhibit unusually long-range interactions one example bonding two atoms multipole forces form rydberg-rydberg molecules large internuclear distances- notably bonding interactions can also arise low-energy scattering rydberg electron negative scattering length ground-state atom case scattering-induced attractive interaction binds ground-state atom rydberg atom well-localized position within rydberg electron wavefunction thereby yields giant molecules can internuclear separations several thousand bohr radii- report spectroscopic characterization exotic molecular states formed rubidium rydberg atoms spherically symmetric s state principal quantum numbers n find spectra vibrational ground state first excited state rydberg molecule rubidium dimer rb5s-rbns agree well simple model predictions data allow us extract s-wave scattering length scattering rydberg electron ground-state atom rb5s low-energy regime kinetic energy <100mev determine lifetimes polarizabilities rydberg molecules given successful characterization s-wave bound rydberg states anticipate p-wave bound states trimer states bound states involving rydberg electron large angular momentum-so-called trilobite molecules-will also realized directly probed near future
