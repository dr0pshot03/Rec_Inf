apoptosis antigen affinity limit effector cell differentiation single naive b cell
exposed antigens naive b cells differentiate different types effector cells: antibody-producing plasma cells germinal center cells memory cells whether individual naive b cell can produce different cell fates remains unclear using limiting dilution approach found many individual naive b cells produced one type effector cell subset whereas others produced subsets capacity differentiate multiple subsets characteristic clonal populations divided many times resisted apoptosis independent isotype switching antigen receptor affinity also influenced effector cell differentiation findings suggest diverse effector cell types arise primary immune response result heterogeneity responses individual naive b cells
