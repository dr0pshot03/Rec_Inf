propagating solitary waves along rapidly moving crack front 
rapidly moving crack brittle material often idealized1 one-dimensional object singular tip moving two-dimensional material however real three-dimensional materials tensile cracks form planar surface whose edge rapidly moving one-dimensional singular front dynamics fronts repetitive interaction2- material inhomogeneities asperities morphology5- fracture surface create yet understood show perturbations12 crack front brittle material result long-lived highly localized waves call front waves waves exhibit unique characteristic shape propagate along crack front approximately13- rayleigh wave speed speed sound along free surface following interaction counter-propagating front waves retain shape amplitude create characteristic traces along fracture surface providing cracks inertia new mode dissipation front waves intrinsically three-dimensional exist conventional two-dimensional theories fracture1 front waves can transport distribute asperity-induced energy fluctuations throughout crack front may help explain cracks remain single coherent entity despite repeated interactions randomly dispersed asperities
