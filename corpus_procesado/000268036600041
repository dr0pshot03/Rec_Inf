ch stretching excitation early barrier f + chd3 reaction inhibits ch bond cleavage
studies impact vibrational excitation molecular reactivity focused reactions late barrier transition state resembling products early barrier reaction conventional wisdom predicts reactants vibration couple efficiently reaction coordinate thus little impact outcome report in-depth experimental study reactivity effects exerted reactant c-h stretching excitation prototypical early-barrier reaction f + chd3 rather counterintuitively find vibration hinders overall reaction rate inhibits scission excited bond favoring df + chd2 product channel influences coproduct vibrational distribution despite conserved chd2 product results highlight substantial gaps predictive framework state-selective polyatomic reactivity
