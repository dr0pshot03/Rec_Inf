high-resolution view yeast meiotic program revealed ribosome profiling
meiosis complex developmental process generates haploid cells diploid progenitors measured messenger rna mrna abundance protein production yeast meiotic sporulation program found strong stage-specific expression genes achieved control mrna levels translational efficiency monitoring protein production timing revealed uncharacterized recombination factors extensive organellar remodeling meiotic translation also shifted toward noncanonical sites including short open reading frames orfs unannnotated transcripts upstream regions known transcripts uorfs ribosome occupancy near-cognate uorfs associated efficient orf translation contrast aug uorfs often exposed regulated leader extensions acted competitively work reveals pervasive translational control meiosis helps illuminate molecular basis broad restructuring meiotic cells
