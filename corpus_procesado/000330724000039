periodic variability large-scale southern hemisphere atmospheric circulation 
periodic behavior climate system important implications weather prediction also understanding interpreting physical processes drive climate variability demonstrate large-scale southern hemisphere atmospheric circulation exhibits marked periodicity time scales approximately days periodicity tied southern hemisphere baroclinic annular mode emerges hemispheric-scale averages eddy fluxes heat eddy kinetic energy precipitation observational theoretical analyses suggest oscillation results feedbacks extratropical baroclinicity wave fluxes heat radiative damping oscillation plays potentially profound role driving large-scale climate variability throughout much mid-latitude southern hemisphere
