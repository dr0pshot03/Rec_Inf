mantle convection plate tectonics: toward integrated physical chemical theory
plate tectonics convection solid rocky mantle responsible transporting heat earth however physics plate tectonics poorly understood planets exhibit recent seismic evidence convection mixing throughout mantle seems odds chemical composition erupted magmas requiring presence several chemically distinct reservoirs within mantle rapid progress two problems emergence first self-consistent models plate tectonics mantle convection along new geochemical models may consistent seismic dynamical constraints mantle structure
