endoribonuclease-prepared sirna screen human cells identifies genes essential cell division
rna interference rnai evolutionarily conserved defence mechanism whereby genes specifically silenced degradation messenger rnas process mediated homologous double-stranded ds rna molecules- invertebrates long dsrnas used genome-wide screens provided insights gene functions- long dsrna triggers nonspecific interferon response many vertebrates short interfering si rna short hairpin sh rnas must used organisms ensure specific gene silencing- report generation genome-scale library endoribonuclease-prepared short interfering esi rnas12 sequence-verified complementary dna collection representing human genes used esirnas library screen genes required cell division hela cells using primary high-throughput cell viability screen followed secondary high content videomicroscopy assay identified genes required cell division include several splicing factors knockdown generates mitotic spindle defects addition putative nuclear-export terminator found speed cell proliferation mitotic progression knockdown thus study uncovers new aspects cell division establishes esirna versatile approach genomic rnai screens mammalian cells
