control alternative rna splicing gene expression eukaryotic riboswitches 
bacteria make extensive use riboswitches sense metabolites control gene expression typically modulating premature transcription termination translation initiation widespread riboswitch class known bacteria responds coenzyme thiamine pyrophosphate tpp derivative vitamin b representatives class also identified fungi plants predicted control messenger rna splicing processing examined three tpp riboswitches filamentous fungus neurospora crassa found one activates two repress gene expression controlling mrna splicing detailed mechanism involving riboswitch-mediated base-pairing changes alternative splicing control elucidated precursor nmt1 mrnas code protein involved tpp metabolism results demonstrate eukaryotic cells employ metabolite-binding rnas regulate rna splicing events important control key biochemical processes
