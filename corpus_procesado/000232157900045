regulated cell-to-cell variation cell-fate decision system 
studied quantitative behaviour cell-to-cell variability prototypical eukaryotic cell-fate decision system mating pheromone response pathway yeast dissected measured sources variation system output analysing thousands individual genetically identical cells small proportion total cell-to-cell variation caused random fluctuations gene transcription translation response expression noise instead variation dominated differences capacity individual cells transmit signals pathway pathway capacity express proteins genes expression capacity cells high expression capacity express proteins higher rate increase volume rapidly results identify two mechanisms regulate cell-to-cell variation pathway capacity first map kinase fus3 suppresses variation high pheromone levels map kinase kss1 enhances variation low pheromone levels second pathway capacity expression capacity negatively correlated suggesting compensatory mechanism allows cells respond precisely pheromone presence large variation expression capacity
