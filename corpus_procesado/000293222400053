independently evolved virulence effectors converge onto hubs plant immune system network
plants generate effective responses infection recognizing conserved variable pathogen-encoded molecules pathogens deploy virulence effector proteins host cells interact physically host proteins modulate defense generated interaction network plant-pathogen effectors two pathogens spanning eukaryote-eubacteria divergence three classes arabidopsis immune system proteins similar arabidopsis proteins noted convergence effectors onto highly interconnected host proteins indirect rather direct connections effectors plant immune receptors demonstrated plant immune system functions tested host proteins interact effectors pathogens thus pathogens different kingdoms deploy independently evolved virulence proteins interact limited set highly connected cellular hubs facilitate diverse life-cycle strategies
