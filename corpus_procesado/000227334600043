water-rich basalts mid-ocean-ridge cold spots
although water present trace amounts suboceanic upper mantle thought play significant role affecting mantle viscosity melting generation crust mid-ocean ridges concentration water oceanic basalts observed stay wt% except water-rich basalts sampled near hotspots generated wet mantle plumes- however report unusually high water content basaltic glasses cold region mid-ocean-ridge system equatorial atlantic ocean basalts sodium-rich generated low degrees melting mantle contain unusually high ratios light versus heavy rare-earth elements implying presence garnet melting region infer water-rich basalts regions thermal minima derive low degrees wet melting greater km deep mantle minor dilution melts produced shallower dry melting view supported numerical modelling therefore conclude oceanic basalts water-rich near hotspots also cold spots
