sp1 transcription factor coordinates caspase-dependent independent apoptotic pathways
animal development proper regulation apoptosis requires precise spatial temporal execution cell-death programs can include caspase-dependent caspase-independent pathways although mechanisms caspase-dependent independent cell killing examined extensively pathways coordinated within single cell fated die unknown show caenorhabditis elegans sp1 transcription factor sptf specifies programmed cell deaths least two cells-the sisters pharyngeal m4 motor neuron aqr sensory neuron-by transcriptionally activating caspase-dependent independent apoptotic pathways sptf directly drives transcription geneegl- encodes bh3-only protein promotes apoptosis activation ced caspase addition sptf directly drives transcription amp-activated protein kinase-related gene pig- encodes protein kinase functions apoptosis m4 sister aqr sister independently pathway activates-ced refs thus single transcription factor controls two distinct cell-killing programs act parallel drive apoptosis findings reveal bivalent regulatory node caspase-dependent independent pathways regulation cell-type-specific apoptosis propose nodes might act features general mechanism regulating cell-type-specific apoptosis therapeutic targets diseases involving dysregulation apoptosis multiple cell-killing mechanisms
