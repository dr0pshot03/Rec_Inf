circulating mitochondrial damps cause inflammatory responses injury 
injury causes systemic inflammatory response syndrome sirs clinically much like sepsis microbial pathogen-associated molecular patterns pamps activate innate immunocytes pattern recognition receptors similarly cellular injury can release endogenous damage-associated molecular patterns damps activate innate immunity mitochondria evolutionary endosymbionts derived bacteria might bear bacterial molecular motifs show injury releases mitochondrial damps mtds circulation functionally important immune consequences mtds include formyl peptides mitochondrial dna activate human polymorphonuclear neutrophils pmns formyl peptide receptor toll-like receptor tlr respectively mtds promote pmn ca+ flux phosphorylation mitogen-activated protein map kinases thus leading pmn migration degranulation vitro vivo circulating mtds can elicit neutrophil-mediated organ injury cellular disruption trauma releases mitochondrial damps evolutionarily conserved similarities bacterial pamps circulation signal innate immune pathways identical activated sepsis create sepsis-like state release mitochondrial enemies within cellular injury key link trauma inflammation sirs
