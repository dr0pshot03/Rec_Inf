clonogenic common myeloid progenitor gives rise myeloid lineages
haematopoietic stem cells give rise progeny progressively lose self-renewal capacity become restricted one lineage points haematopoietic stem cell-derived progenitors commit various lineages remain mostly unknown identified clonogenic common lymphoid progenitor can differentiate t b natural killer cells myeloid cells report prospective identification purification characterization using cell-surface markers flow cytometry complementary clonogenic common myeloid progenitor gives rise myeloid lineages common myeloid progenitors give rise either megakaryocyte/erythrocyte granulocyte/macrophage progenitors purified progenitors used provide first-pass expression profile various haematopoiesis-related genes propose common lymphoid progenitor common myeloid progenitor populations reflect earliest branch points lymphoid myeloid lineages commitment common myeloid progenitors either megakaryocyte/erythrocyte granulocyte/macrophage lineages mutually exclusive events
