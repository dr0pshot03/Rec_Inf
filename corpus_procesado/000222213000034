mercurys capture / spin-orbit resonance result chaotic dynamics 
mercury locked / spin-orbit resonance rotates three times axis every two orbits around sun- stability equilibrium state well established- understanding state initially arose remains unsatisfactory unless one uses unrealistic tidal model constant torques account observed damping libration planet computed probability capture / resonance low per cent led proposal core-mantle friction may increased capture probability process requires specific values core viscosity show chaotic evolution mercurys orbit can drive eccentricity beyond planets history efficiently leads capture / resonance numerical integrations orbits mercury gyr capture / spin-orbit resonant state probable final outcome planets evolution occurring per cent time
