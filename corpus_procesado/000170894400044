segregation human neural stem cells developing primate forebrain 
many central nervous system regions stages life contain neural stem cells nscs explored disparate nsc pools might emerge traceable clone human nscs implanted intraventricularly allow integration cerebral germinal zones old world monkey fetuses nscs distributed two subpopulations: one contributed corticogenesis migrating along radial glia temporally appropriate layers cortical plate differentiating lamina-appropriate neurons glia remained undifferentiated contributed secondary germinal zone subventricular zone occasional members interspersed throughout brain parenchyma early neurogenetic program allocates progeny nscs either immediately organogenesis undifferentiated pools later use postdevelopmental brain
