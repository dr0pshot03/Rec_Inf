bell violation using entangled photons without fair-sampling assumption 
violation bell inequality experimental observation forces abandonment local realistic viewpoint-namely one physical properties probabilistically defined independently measurement physical influence can propagate faster speed light experimental violations require additional assumptions depending specific construction making vulnerable so-called loopholes use entangled photons violate bell inequality closing fair-sampling loophole without assuming sample measured photons accurately represents entire ensemble use eberhard form bells inequality vulnerable fair-sampling assumption allows lower collection efficiency forms technical improvements photon source high-efficiency transition-edge sensors crucial achieving sufficiently high collection efficiency experiment makes photon first physical system main loopholes closed albeit different experiments
