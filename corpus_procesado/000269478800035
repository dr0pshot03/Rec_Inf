ips cells produce viable mice tetraploid complementation 
since initial description induced pluripotent stem ips cells created forced expression four transcription factors mouse fibroblasts technique used generate embryonic stem es-cell-like pluripotent cells variety cell types species including primates rat- become popular means reprogram somatic genomes embryonic-like pluripotent state preferred alternative somatic-cell nuclear transfer somatic-cell fusion es cells however ips cell reprogramming remains slow inefficient notably live animals produced stringent tetraploid complementation assay indicative failure create fully pluripotent cells report generation several ips cell lines capable generating viable fertile live-born progeny tetraploid complementation ips cells maintain pluripotent potential close es cells generated vivo nuclear transfer embryos demonstrate practicality using ips cells useful tools characterization cellular reprogramming developmental potency confirm ips cells can attain true pluripotency similar es cells
