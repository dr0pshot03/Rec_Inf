secreted peptide dilp8 coordinates drosophila tissue growth developmental timing
little known organ growth monitored coordinated developmental timing complex organisms insects impairment larval tissue growth delays growth morphogenesis revealing coupling mechanism carried genetic screen drosophila identify molecules expressed growing tissues participating coupling identified dilp8 gene whose silencing rescues developmental delay induced abnormally growing tissues dilp8 highly induced conditions growth impairment produces developmental delay dilp8 encodes peptide expression secretion sufficient delay metamorphosis without affecting tissue integrity propose dilp8 peptide secreted signal coordinates growth status tissues developmental timing
