tomographic imaging using nonlinear response magnetic particles 
use contrast agents tracers medical imaging long history1- provide important information diagnosis therapy desired applications higher resolution required can obtained using currently available medical imaging techniques consider example use magnetic tracers magnetic resonance imaging: detection thresholds vitro8 vivo9 imaging background signal host tissue crucial limiting factor sensitive method detecting magnetic particles directly measure magnetic fields using relaxometry10; approach drawback inverse problem associated transforming data spatial image ill posed therefore yields low spatial resolution present method obtaining high-resolution image tracers takes advantage nonlinear magnetization curve small magnetic particles initial phantom experiments reported demonstrate feasibility imaging method resolution achieve already well mm evaluate prospects improvement show method potential developed imaging method characterized high spatial resolution well high sensitivity
