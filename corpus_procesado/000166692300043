molecular phylogenetics origins placental mammals 
precise hierarchy ancient divergence events led present assemblage modern placental mammals area controversy among morphologists palaeontologists molecular evolutionists address potential weaknesses limited character taxon sampling comprehensive molecular phylogenetic analysis species sampled across extant orders placental mammals examined sequence variation homologous gene segments including nearly base pairs selected maximal phylogenetic informativeness resolving hierarchy early mammalian divergence phylogenetic analyses identify four primary superordinal clades: afrotheria elephants manatees hyraxes tenrecs aardvark elephant shrews; ii xenarthra sloths anteaters armadillos; iii glires rodents lagomorphs sister taxon primates flying lemurs tree shrews; iv remaining orders placental mammals cetaceans artiodactyls perissodactyls carnivores pangolins bats core insectivores results provide new insight pattern early placental mammal radiation
