inhibition gli1 mobilizes endogenous neural stem cells remyelination 
enhancing repair myelin important still elusive therapeutic goal many neurological disorders1 multiple sclerosis inflammatory demyelinating disease endogenous remyelination occur frequently insufficient restore function parenchymal oligodendrocyte progenitor cells endogenous adult neural stem cells resident within subventricular zone known sources remyelinating cells2 characterize contribution remyelination subset adult neural stem cells identified expression gli1 transcriptional effector sonic hedgehog pathway show cells recruited subventricular zone populate demyelinated lesions forebrain never enter healthy white matter tracts unexpectedly recruitment pool neural stem cells differentiation oligodendrocytes significantly enhanced genetic pharmacological inhibition gli1 importantly complete inhibition canonical hedgehog signalling ineffective indicating role gli1 augmenting hedgehog signalling retarding myelination specialized indeed inhibition gli1 improves functional outcome relapsing/remitting model experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis neuroprotective thus endogenous neural stem cells can mobilized repair demyelinated lesions inhibiting gli1 identifying new therapeutic avenue treatment demyelinating disorders
