development cells start pluripotent state can differentiate many cell types progressively develop narrower potential gene-expression programmes become defined restricted potentially locked pluripotent stem cells express genes encode set core transcription factors genes required later development repressed histone marks confer short-term therefore flexible epigenetic silencing contrast methylation dna confers long-term epigenetic silencing particular sequences transposons imprinted genes pluripotency-associated genes somatic cells long-term silencing can reprogrammed demethylation dna process might involve dna repair known whether epigenetic marks primary role determining cell lineage commitment development
