direct reversible hydrogenation co2 formate bacterial carbon dioxide reductase
storage transportation hydrogen major obstacle use fuel increasingly considered alternative direct handling hydrogen use carbon dioxide co2 intermediate storage material however co2 thermodynamically stable developed chemical catalysts often require high temperatures pressures and/or additives high catalytic rates present discovery bacterial hydrogen-dependent carbon dioxide reductase acetobacterium woodii directly catalyzing hydrogenation co2 also demonstrate whole-cell system able produce formate sole end product dihydrogen h- co2 well syngas discovery opens biotechnological alternatives efficient co2 hydrogenation either using isolated enzyme employing whole-cell catalysis
