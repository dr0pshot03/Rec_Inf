regulation antigen-specific cd8+ t cell homeostasis perforin interferon-gamma 
t cell memory depends factors regulate expansion death cells antigenic stimulation mice deficient perforin interferon-gamma ifn-gamma exhibited increased expansion altered immunodominance decreased death antigen-specific cd8+ t cells infection attenuated strain listeria monocytogenes cleared mice expansion cd8+ t cells controlled perforin whereas ifn-gamma regulated immunodominance death phase thus perforin ifn-gamma regulate distinct elements cd8+ t cell homeostasis independently role antimicrobial effector molecules
