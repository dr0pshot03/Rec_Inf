pulsatile stimulation determines timing specificity nf-kappa b-dependent transcription
nuclear factor kappa b nf-kappa b transcription factor regulates cellular stress responses immune response infection nf-kappa b activation results oscillations nuclear nf-kappa b abundance define function oscillations treated cells repeated short pulses tumor necrosis factor-alpha various intervals mimic pulsatile inflammatory signals pulse intervals analyzed observed synchronous cycles nf-kappa b nuclear translocation lower frequency stimulations gave repeated full-amplitude translocations whereas higher frequency pulses gave reduced translocation indicating failure reset deterministic stochastic mathematical models predicted negative feedback loops regulate resetting system cellular heterogeneity altering stimulation intervals gave different patterns nf-kappa b-dependent gene expression supports idea oscillation frequency functional role
