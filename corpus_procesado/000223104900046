plant vacuolar protease vpe mediates virus-induced hypersensitive cell death 
programmed cell death pcd animals depends caspase protease activity plants also exhibit pcd example response pathogens although plant caspase remains elusive show vacuolar processing enzyme vpe protease essential virus-induced hypersensitive response involves pcd vpe deficiency prevented virus-induced hypersensitive cell death tobacco plants vpe structurally unrelated caspases although vpe caspase activity thus plants evolved regulated cellular suicide strategy unlike pcd animals mediated vpe cellular vacuole
