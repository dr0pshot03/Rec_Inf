disorder order marching locusts 
recent models theoretical physics predicted mass-migrating animal groups may share group-level properties irrespective type animals group one key prediction density animals group increases rapid transition occurs disordered movement individuals within group highly aligned collective motion understanding transition crucial control mobile swarming insect pests desert locust confirmed prediction rapid transition disordered ordered movement identified critical density onset coordinated marching locust nymphs also demonstrated dynamic instability motion densities typical locusts field groups can switch direction without external perturbation potentially facilitating rapid transfer directional information
