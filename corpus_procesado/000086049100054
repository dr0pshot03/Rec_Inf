rapid progression aids hiv+ individuals structural variant chemokine receptor cx3cr1 
human immunodeficiency virus hiv enters cells vitro via cd4 coreceptor known coreceptors important vivo poorly defined may inferred disease-modifying mutations ccr5 two single nucleotide polymorphisms described caucasians cx3cr1 hiv coreceptor leukocyte chemotactic/adhesion receptor chemokine fractalkine hiv-infected patients homozygous cx3cr1- m280 variant haplotype affecting two amino acids isoleucine- methionine- progressed aids rapidly haplotypes functional cx3cr1 analysis showed fractalkine binding reduced among patients homozygous particular haplotype thus cx3cr1- m280 recessive genetic risk factor hiv/aids
