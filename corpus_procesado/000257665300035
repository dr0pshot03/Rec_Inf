imaging dynamics light atoms molecules graphene
observing individual building blocks matter one primary goals microscopy invention scanning tunnelling microscope revolutionized experimental surface science atomic scale features solid state surface finally readily imaged however scanning tunnelling microscopy limited applicability due restrictions example sample conductivity cleanliness data acquisition rate older microscopy technique transmission electron microscopy tem benefited tremendously recent years subtle instrumentation advances individual heavy high-atomic-number atoms can now detected tem- even embedded within semiconductor material detecting individual low atomic number atom example carbon even hydrogen still extremely challenging impossible via conventional tem owing low contrast light elements - demonstrate means observe conventional tem even smallest atoms molecules: clean single layer graphene membrane adsorbates atomic hydrogen carbon can seen suspended free space directly image individual adatoms along carbon chains vacancies investigate dynamics real time techniques open way reveal dynamics complex chemical reactions identify atomic scale structure unknown adsorbates addition study atomic scale defects graphene may provide insights nanoelectronic applications interesting material
