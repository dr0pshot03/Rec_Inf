sir1 upstream component auxin signaling identified chemical genetics 
auxin plant hormone regulates many aspects plant growth development used chemical genetics approach identify sir1 regulator many auxin-inducible genes sir1 mutant resistant sirtinol small molecule activates many auxin-inducible genes promotes auxin-related developmental phenotypes sir1 predicted encode protein composed ubiquitin-activating enzyme e1-like domain rhodanese-like domain homologous prolyl isomerase suggest molecular context auxin signal propagated exert biological effects
