virus-helminth coinfection reveals microbiota-independent mechanism immunomodulation 
mammalian intestine colonized beneficial commensal bacteria site infection pathogens including helminth parasites helminths induce potent immunomodulatory effects whether effects mediated direct regulation host immunity indirectly eliciting changes microbiota unknown tested context virus-helminth coinfection helminth coinfection resulted impaired antiviral immunity associated changes microbiota stat6-dependent helminth-induced alternative activation macrophages notably helminth-induced impairment antiviral immunity evident germ-free mice neutralization ym1 chitinase-like molecule associated alternatively activated macrophages partially restore antiviral immunity data indicate helminth-induced immunomodulation occurs independently changes microbiota dependent ym1
