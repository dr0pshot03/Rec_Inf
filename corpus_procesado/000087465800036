scalar turbulence 
advection passive substance turbulent flow important many natural engineering settings concentration substance can exhibit complex dynamic behaviour shows many phenomenological parallels behaviour turbulent velocity field yet statistical properties so-called passive scalar turbulence decoupled underlying velocity field passive scalar turbulence recently yielded mathematical analysis progress may ultimately lead better understanding still intractable problem fluid turbulence
