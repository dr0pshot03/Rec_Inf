laser-induced electron tunneling diffraction 
molecular structure usually determined measuring diffraction pattern molecule impresses x-rays electrons used laser field extract electrons molecule accelerate cases force recollide diffract parent ion within fraction laser period show momentum distribution extracted electron carries fingerprint highest occupied molecular orbital whereas elastically scattered electrons reveal position nuclear components molecule thus one comprehensive technology photoelectrons give detailed information electronic orbital position nuclei
