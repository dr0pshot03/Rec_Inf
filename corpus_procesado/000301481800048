coevolution multidimensional trait space favours escape parasites pathogens 
almost species subject continuous attack parasites pathogens parasites pathogens tend shorter generation times often experience stronger selection due interaction victims frequently argued evolve rapidly thus maintain advantage evolutionary race defence counter-defence prediction generates apparent paradox: victim species survive even thrive face continuous onslaught rapidly evolving enemies one potential explanation defence physiologically mechanically behaviourally easier attack evolution less constrained victims parasites pathogens another possible explanation parasites pathogens enemies victim species persist parasites pathogens regulated top thus generally modest demographic impacts victimpopulations explore third possibility: victim species evolutionarily impotent conventional wisdom holds instead unique evolutionary advantages help level playing field use quantitative genetic analysis individual-based simulations show victims can achieve advantage coevolution involves multiple traits host parasite
