dna ligase iii critical mtdna integrity xrcc1-mediated nuclear dna repair 
dna replication repair mammalian cells involves three distinct dna ligases: ligase lig1 ligase iii lig3 ligase iv lig4 lig3 considered key ligase base excision repair stability depends upon nuclear binding partner xrcc1 critical factor dna repair pathway lig3 also present mitochondria role mitochondrial dna mtdna maintenance independent xrcc1 ref however biological role lig3 unclear inactivation murine lig3 results early embryonic lethality report lig3 essential mtdna integrity dispensable nuclear dna repair inactivation lig3 mouse nervous system resulted mtdna loss leading profound mitochondrial dysfunction disruption cellular homeostasis incapacitating ataxia similarly inactivation lig3 cardiac muscle resulted mitochondrial dysfunction defective heart-pump function leading heart failure however lig3 inactivation result nuclear dna repair deficiency indicating essential dna repair functions xrcc1 can occur absence lig3 instead found lig1 critical dna repair acted cooperative manner lig3 additionally lig3 deficiency recapitulate hallmark features neural xrcc1 inactivation dna damage-induced cerebellar interneuron loss underscoring functional separation dna repair factors therefore data reveal critical biological role lig3 maintain mtdna integrity xrcc1-dependent dna repair
