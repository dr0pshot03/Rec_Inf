recognition haemagglutinins virus-infected cells nkp46 activates lysis human nk cells
natural killer nk cells destroy virus-infected tumour cells apparently without need previous antigen stimulation part target cells recognized diminished expression major histocompatibility complex mhc class molecules normally interact inhibitory receptors nk cell surface- nk cells also express triggering receptors specific non-mhc ligands nature ligands recognized target cells undefined- nkp46 thought main activating receptor human nk cells show soluble nkp46-immunoglobulin fusion protein binds haemagglutinin influenza virus haemagglutinin-neuraminidase parainfluenza virus substantial subset nk cells recognition nkp46 required lyse cells expressing corresponding viral glycoproteins binding requires sialylation nkp46 oligosaccharides consistent known sialic binding capacity viral glycoproteins findings indicate nkp46-expressing nk cells may recognize target cells infected influenza parainfluenza without decreased expression target-cell mhc class protein
