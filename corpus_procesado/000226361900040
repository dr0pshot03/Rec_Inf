retinoic acid signaling restricts cardiac progenitor pool
organogenesis begins specification progenitor cell population size provides foundation organs final dimensions present new mechanism regulating number progenitor cells limiting density within competent region demonstrate retinoic acid signaling restricts cardiac specification zebrafish embryo reduction retinoic acid signaling causes formation excess cardiomyocytes via fate transformations increase cardiac progenitor density within multipotential zone thus retinoic acid signaling creates balance cardiac noncardiac identities thereby refining dimensions cardiac progenitor pool
