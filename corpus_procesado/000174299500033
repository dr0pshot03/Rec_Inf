spontaneous air-driven separation vertically vibrated fine granular mixtures
report observation spontaneous separation vertically vibrated mixtures fine bronze glass spheres similar diameters tow frequencies sufficient vibrational amplitudes sharp boundary forms tower region glass upper region heavier bronze boundary undergoes various oscillations including periodic tilting motion remains extremely sharp higher frequencies bronze separates mid-height layer upper lower glass regions oscillations largely absent mechanism responsible separation can traced effect air granular motion
