chemical structure hawaiian mantle plume 
hawaiian emperor volcanic island seamount chain usually attributed hot mantle plume located beneath pacific lithosphere delivers material sourced deep mantle surface1- shield volcanoes hawaiian islands distributed two curvilinear parallel trends termed kea loa whose rocks characterized general geochemical differences2- led proposition hawaiian volcanoes sample compositionally distinct concentrically zoned regions underlying mantle plume45 melt inclusions samples local magma frozen olivine phenocrysts crystallization may record complexities mantle sources6 thereby providing better insight chemical structure plumes report discovery kea loa-like major trace element compositions olivine-hosted melt inclusions individual shield-stage hawaiian volcanoes even within single rock samples infer data one mantle source component may dominate single lava flow two mantle source components consistently represented extent lavas regardless specific geographic location volcano therefore suggest hawaiian mantle plume unlikely compositionally concentrically zoned instead observed chemical variation probably controlled thermal structure plume
