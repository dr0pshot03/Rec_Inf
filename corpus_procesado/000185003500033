major ecological transitions wild sunflowers facilitated hybridization
hybridization frequent many organismal groups role adaptation poorly understood sunflowers species found extreme habitats ancient hybrids new gene combinations generated hybridization speculated contributed ecological divergence possibility tested phenotypic genomic comparisons ancient synthetic hybrids trait differences ancient hybrids recreated complementary gene action synthetic hybrids favored selection combinations parental chromosomal segments required generate extreme phenotypes synthetic hybrids also occurred ancient hybrids thus hybridization facilitated ecological divergence sunflowers
