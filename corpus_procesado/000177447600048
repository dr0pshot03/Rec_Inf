calicheamicin gene cluster iterative type enediyne pks
enediynes exemplify natures ingenuity cloned characterized biosynthetic locus coding perhaps notorious member nonchromoprotein enediyne family calicheamicin gene cluster contains unusual polyketide synthase pks demonstrated essential enediyne biosynthesis comparison calicheamicin locus locus encoding chromoprotein enediyne c reveals enediyne pks highly conserved among distinct enediyne families contrary previous hypotheses suggests chromoprotein nonchromoprotein enediynes generated similar biosynthetic pathways
