strontium-doped perovskites rival platinum catalysts treating nox simulated diesel exhaust 
high cost poor thermal durability current lean nitrogen oxides nox aftertreatment catalysts two major barriers widespread adoption highly fuel-efficient diesel engines demonstrated use strontium-doped perovskite oxides efficient platinum substitutes diesel oxidation doc lean nox trap lnt catalysts lanthanum-based perovskite catalysts coated monolith substrates showed excellent activities oxidation reaction critical step demands heavy usage platinum current diesel aftertreatment system realistic conditions la1-xsrxcoo3 catalysts achieved higher no-to-no2 conversions commercial platinum-based doc catalyst similarly la09sr01mno3-based lnt catalyst achieved nox reduction performance comparable commercial platinum-based counterpart results show promise considerably lower-cost diesel exhaust treatment system
