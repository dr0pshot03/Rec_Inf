geometric quantum computation using nuclear magnetic resonance 
significant development computing discovery computational power quantum computers exceeds turing machines central experimental realization quantum information processing construction fault-tolerant quantum logic gates operation requires conditional quantum dynamics one sub-system undergoes coherent evolution depends quantum state another sub-system particular evolving sub-system may acquire conditional phase shift although conventionally dynamic origin phase shifts can also geometric conditional geometric berry phases depend geometry path executed therefore resilient certain types errors suggests possibility intrinsically fault-tolerant way performing quantum gate operations nuclear magnetic resonance techniques already used demonstrate simple quantum information processing- geometric phase shifts- combine ideas performing nuclear magnetic resonance experiment conditional berry phase implemented demonstrating controlled phase shift gate
