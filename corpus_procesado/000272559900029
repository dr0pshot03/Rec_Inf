cancer-associated idh1 mutations produce hydroxyglutarate
mutations enzyme cytosolic isocitrate dehydrogenase idh1 common feature major subset primary human brain cancers mutations occur single amino acid residue idh1 active site resulting loss enzymes ability catalyse conversion isocitrate alpha-ketoglutarate however single copy gene mutated tumours raising possibility mutations result simple loss function show cancer-associated idh1 mutations result new ability enzyme catalyse nadph-dependent reduction alpha-ketoglutarate r--hydroxyglutarate 2hg structural studies demonstrate arginine mutated histidine residues active site shifted produce structural changes consistent reduced oxidative decarboxylation isocitrate acquisition ability convert alpha-ketoglutarate 2hg excess accumulation 2hg shown lead elevated risk malignant brain tumours patients inborn errors 2hg metabolism similarly human malignant gliomas harbouring idh1 mutations find markedly elevated levels 2hg data demonstrate idh1 mutations result production onco-metabolite 2hg indicate excess 2hg accumulates vivo contributes formation malignant progression gliomas
