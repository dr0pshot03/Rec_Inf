lateral relocation auxin efflux regulator pin3 mediates tropism arabidopsis 
long-standing models propose plant growth responses light gravity mediated asymmetric distribution phytohormone auxin1- physiological studies implicated specific transport system relocates auxin laterally thereby effecting differential growth4; however neither molecular components system cellular mechanism auxin redistribution light gravity perception identified show auxin accumulates asymmetrically differential growth efflux-dependent manner mutations arabidopsis gene pin3 regulator auxin efflux alter differential growth pin3 expressed gravity-sensing tissues pin3 protein accumulating predominantly lateral cell surface pin3 localizes plasma membrane vesicles cycle actin-dependent manner root columella pin3 positioned symmetrically plasma membrane rapidly relocalizes laterally gravity stimulation data indicate pin3 component lateral auxin transport system regulating tropic growth addition actin-dependent relocalization pin3 response gravity provides mechanism redirecting auxin flux trigger asymmetric growth
