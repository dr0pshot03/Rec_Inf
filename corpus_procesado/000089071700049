prokaryotic regulation epithelial responses inhibition kappa b-alpha ubiquitination 
epithelia vertebrate intestinal tract characteristically maintain inflammatory hyporesponsiveness toward lumenal prokaryotic microflora report identification enteric organisms nonvirulent salmonella strains whose direct interaction model human epithelia attenuate synthesis inflammatory effector molecules elicited diverse proinflammatory stimuli immunosuppressive effect involves inhibition inhibitor kappa b/nuclear factor kappa b kappa b/nf-kappa b pathway blockade kappa b-alpha degradation prevents subsequent nuclear translocation active nf-kappa b dimer although phosphorylation kappa b-alpha occurs subsequent polyubiquitination necessary regulated kappa b-alpha degradation completely abrogated data suggest prokaryotic determinants responsible unique tolerance gastrointestinal mucosa proinflammatory stimuli
