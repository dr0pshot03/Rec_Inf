spatially structured photons travel free space slower speed light
speed light free space constant cornerstone modern physics however light beams finite transverse size leads modification wave vectors resulting change phase group velocities study group velocity single photons measuring change arrival time results changing beams transverse spatial structure using time-correlated photon pairs show reduction group velocity photons bessel beam photons focused gaussian beam cases delay several micrometers propagation distance similar meter work highlights even free space invariance speed light applies plane waves
