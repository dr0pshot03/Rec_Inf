transcriptional regulators form diverse groups context-dependent regulatory functions
one important questions biology transcription factors tfs cofactors control enhancer function thus gene expression enhancer activation usually requires combinations several tfs indicating tfs function synergistically combinatorially however tf binding extensively studied little known combinations tfs cofactors control enhancer function bound typically unclear tfs participate combinatorial enhancer activation whether different tfs form functionally distinct groups certain tfs might substitute defined enhancer contexts assess potential regulatory contributions tfs cofactors combinatorial enhancer control enhancer complementation assays recruited gal4-dna-binding-domain fusions drosophila tfs cofactors enhancer contexts measured enhancer activities luciferase assays s2 cells factors functional least one context yet contributions differed contexts varied repression activation fold individual factors based functional similarities across contexts define groups tfs differ developmental functions protein sequence features similar tfs can substitute enabling enhancer re-engineering exchanging tf motifs tf-cofactor pairs cooperate enhancer control interact physically overall show activators repressors can diverse regulatory functions typically depend enhancer context systematic functional characterization tfs cofactors understanding combinatorial enhancer control gene regulation
