probing threshold h atom transfer along hydrogen-bonded ammonia wire 
characterized entrance channel reaction threshold mechanism excited-state h atom transfer reaction along unidirectionally hydrogen-bonded "wire" o-hnh3nh3nh3n excitation supersonically cooled -hydroxyquinolinenh33 vibrationless s- state produces reaction whereas excitation ammonia-wire vibrations induces h atom transfer reaction threshold approximate wave numbers translocation steps along wire produce s- state -ketoquinolinenh33 tautomer ab initio calculations show proton electron movement along wire closely coupled rate-controlling s- state barriers arise crossings pipi* rydberg-type pisigma* state
