optical magnetic imaging living cells
magnetic imaging powerful tool probing biological physical systems however existing techniques either poor spatial resolution compared optical microscopy hence generally applicable imaging sub-cellular structure example magnetic resonance imaging entail operating conditions preclude application living biological samples providing submicrometre resolution example scanning superconducting quantum interference device microscopy electron holography magnetic resonance force microscopy demonstrate magnetic imaging living cells magnetotactic bacteria ambient laboratory conditions sub-cellular spatial resolution nanometres using optically detected magnetic field imaging array consisting nanometre-scale layer nitrogen-vacancy colour centres implanted surface diamond chip bacteria placed diamond surface optically probe nitrogen-vacancy quantum spin states rapidly reconstruct images vector components magnetic field created chains magnetic nanoparticles magnetosomes produced bacteria also spatially correlate magnetic field maps optical images acquired apparatus wide-field microscopy allows parallel optical magnetic imaging multiple cells population submicrometre resolution field view excess micrometres scanning electron microscope images bacteria confirm correlated optical magnetic images can used locate characterize magnetosomes bacterium results provide new capability imaging bio-magnetic structures living cells ambient conditions high spatial resolution will enable mapping wide range magnetic signals within cells cellular networks
