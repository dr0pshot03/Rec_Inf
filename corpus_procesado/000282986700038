structure iron earths inner core 
earths solid inner core mainly composed iron fe relevant ultrahigh pressure temperature conditions difficult produce experimentally preferred crystal structure fe inner core remains uncertain static compression experiments showed hexagonal close-packed hcp structure fe stable gigapascals kelvin corresponding inner core conditions observed weak temperature dependence c/a axial ratio suggests hcp fe elastically anisotropic core temperatures preferred orientation hcp phase may explain previously observed inner core seismic anisotropy
