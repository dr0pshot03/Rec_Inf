control dynamic cftr selectivity glutamate atp epithelial cells 
cystic fibrosis caused mutations cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator cftr anion channel1 phosphorylation atp hydrolysis generally believed indispensable activating cftr2 report phosphorylation atp-independent activation cftr cytoplasmic glutamate exclusively elicits cl- hco3- conductance human sweat duct also report anion selectivity glutamate-activated cftr intrinsically fixed can undergo dynamic shift conduct hco3 process involving atp hydrolysis duct cells patients deltaf508 mutant cftr showed glutamate/atp activated cl hco3 conductance contrast duct cells heterozygous patients r117h/deltaf508 mutant cftr also lost cl conductance yet retained significant hco3 conductance hence glutamate control neuronal ion channels well known can also regulate anion conductance selectivity cftr native epithelial cells loss uniquely regulated hco3 conductance probably responsible severe forms cystic fibrosis pathology
