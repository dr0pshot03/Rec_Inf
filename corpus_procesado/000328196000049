long-term dynamics adaptation asexual populations
experimental studies evolution increased greatly number recent years stimulated growing power genomic tools however organismal fitness remains ultimate metric interpreting experiments dynamics fitness remain poorly understood long time scales examine fitness trajectories escherichia coli populations generations mean fitness appears increase without bound consistent power law also derive power-law relation theoretically incorporating clonal interference diminishing-returns epistasis dynamical model changes mean fitness time
