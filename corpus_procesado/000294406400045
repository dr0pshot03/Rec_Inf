herschel detects massive dust reservoir supernova 1987a
report far-infrared submillimeter observations supernova 1987a star whose explosion observed february large magellanic cloud galaxy located light years away observations reveal presence population cold dust grains radiating temperature kelvin rate times luminosity sun intensity spectral energy distribution emission suggest dust mass times mass sun radiation must originate supernova ejecta requires efficient precipitation refractory material dust observations imply supernovae can produce large dust masses detected young galaxies high redshifts
