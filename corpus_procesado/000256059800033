microbial engines drive earths biogeochemical cycles
virtually nonequilibrium electron transfers earth driven set nanobiological machines composed largely multimeric protein complexes associated small number prosthetic groups machines evolved exclusively microbes early planets history yet despite antiquity highly conserved hence although enormous genetic diversity nature remains relatively stable set core genes coding major redox reactions essential life biogeochemical cycles genes created coevolved biogeochemical cycles passed microbe microbe primarily horizontal gene transfer major challenge coming decades understand machines evolved work processes control activity molecular planetary scales
