nitriding iron lower temperatures 
microstructure surface layer pure iron plate refined nanometer scale means surface mechanical attrition treatment generates repetitive severe plastic deformation surface layer subsequent nitriding kinetics treated iron nanostructured surface layer greatly enhanced nitriding temperature low 300c much lower conventional nitriding temperatures 500degreesc enhanced processing method demonstrates technological significance nanomaterials improving traditional processing techniques provides new approach selective surface reactions solids
