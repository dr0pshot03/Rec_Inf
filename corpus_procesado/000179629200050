signaling rat frizzled- phosphodiesterase cyclic gmp 
frizzled- receptor rfz2 rat binds wnt proteins can signal activating calcium release intracellular stores show wildtype rfz2 chimeric receptor consisting extracellular transmembrane portions beta2-adrenergic receptor cytoplasmic domains rfz2 also signaled modulation cyclic guanosine -monophosphate cgmp activation either receptor led decline intracellular concentration cgmp process inhibited cells treated pertussis toxin reduced suppression expression heterotrimeric gtp-binding protein g protein transducin suppressed inhibition cgmp-specific phosphodiesterase pde activity moreover pde inhibitors blocked rfz2-induced calcium transients zebrafish embryos thus frizzled- appears couple pdes calcium transients g proteins
