skyrmions ferromagnetic bose-einstein condensate
multi-component bose-einstein condensates- provide opportunities explore experimentally wealth physics associated spin degrees freedom- ground-state properties- line-like vortex excitations quantum systems studied theoretically principle nontrivial spin textures consisting point-like topological excitations orskyrmions exist multi-component bose-einstein condensate owing superfluid nature gas although skyrmion excitations already known context nuclear physics quantum-hall effect creating excitations atomic condensate offer opportunity study physical behaviour much greater detail also enabling ab initio comparison theory experiment investigate theoretically stability skyrmions fictitious spin-/ condensate rb atoms find skyrmions can exist gas metastable state lifetime comparable even longer typical lifetime condensate
