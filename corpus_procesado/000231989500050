stimulus specificity gene expression programs determined temporal control ikk activity 
small number mammalian signaling pathways mediate myriad distinct physiological responses diverse cellular stimuli temporal control signaling module contains kappa b kinase ikk substrate inhibitor nf-kappa b kappa b key inflammatory transcription factor nf-kappa b can allow selective gene activation demonstrated different inflammatory stimuli induce distinct ikk profiles examined underlying molecular mechanisms although tumor necrosis factor-alpha tnf alpha-induced ikk activity rapidly attenuated negative feedback lipopolysaccharide lps signaling lps-specific gene expression programs dependent cytokine-mediated positive feedback mechanism thus distinct biological responses lps tnf alpha depend signaling pathway-specific mechanisms regulate temporal profile ikk activity
