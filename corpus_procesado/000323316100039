charting dynamic dna methylation landscape human genome 
dna methylation defining feature mammalian cellular identity essential normal development cell types except germ cells pre-implantation embryos- display relatively stable dna methylation patterns % cpgs methylated despite recent advances still limited understanding many cpgs participate genomic regulation report in-depth analysis whole-genome bisulphite sequencing data sets across diverse human cell tissue types observe dynamic regulation % autosomal cpgs within normal developmental context distal transcription start sites dynamic cpgs co-localize gene regulatory elements particularly enhancers transcription-factor-binding sites allow identification key lineage-specific regulators addition differentially methylated regions dmrs often contain single nucleotide polymorphisms associated cell-type-related diseases determined genome-wide association studies results also highlight general inefficiency whole-genome bisulphite sequencing % sequencing reads across data sets provided little relevant information cpg methylation demonstrate utility dmr set use classify unknown samples identify representative signature regions recapitulate major dna methylation dynamics summary although theory every cpg can change methylation state results suggest fraction part coordinated regulatory programs therefore selected dmrs can serve starting point guide new effective reduced representation approaches capture informative fraction cpgs well pinpoint putative regulatory elements
