nuclear rnase iii drosha initiates microrna processing
hundreds small rnas similar to22 nucleotides collectively named micrornas mirnas discovered recently animals plants- although functions unravelled- mechanism biogenesis remains poorly understood mirnas transcribed long primary transcripts pri-mirnas whose maturation occurs sequential processing events: nuclear processing pri-mirnas stem-loop precursors similar to70 nucleotides pre-mirnas cytoplasmic processing pre-mirnas mature mirnas dicer member rnase iii superfamily bidentate nucleases mediates latter step- whereas processing enzyme former step unknown identify another rnase iii human drosha core nuclease executes initiation step mirna processing nucleus immunopurified drosha cleaved pri-mirna release pre-mirna vitro furthermore rna interference drosha resulted strong accumulation pri-mirna reduction pre-mirna mature mirna vivo thus two rnase iii proteins drosha dicer may collaborate stepwise processing mirnas key roles mirna-mediated gene regulation processes development differentiation
