itinerant ferromagnetism fermi gas ultracold atoms 
can gas spin-up spin-down fermions become ferromagnetic repulsive interactions addressed question yet definitive theoretical answer experiment ultracold two-component fermi gas observation nonmonotonic behavior lifetime kinetic energy size increasing repulsive interactions provides strong evidence phase transition ferromagnetic state observations imply itinerant ferromagnetism delocalized fermions possible without lattice band structure data validate basic model ferromagnetism introduced stoner
