electron pockets fermi surface hole-doped high-t-c superconductors 
high-temperature superconductivity copper oxides occurs materials chemically tuned carrier concentration intermediate metallic state high doping insulating state zero doping underlying evolution electron system absence superconductivity still unclear question central importance whether involves intermediate phase broken symmetry fermi surface electronic states underdoped ybco materials yba2cu3oy yba2cu4o8 recently shown include small pockets- contrast large cylinder characterizes overdoped regime pointing topological change fermi surface report observation negative hall resistance magnetic-field-induced normal state yba2cu3oy yba2cu4o8 reveals pockets electron-like rather hole-like propose electron pockets probably arise reconstruction fermi surface caused onset density-wave phase thought occur electron-doped copper oxides near onset antiferromagnetic order comparison materials la2cuo4 family exhibit spin/charge density-wave order- suggests fermi surface reconstruction also occurs materials pointing generic property high-transition-temperature t-c superconductors
