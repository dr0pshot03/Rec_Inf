control conformational interpolymer effects conjugated polymers 
role conjugated polymers emerging electronic sensor display technologies rapidly expanding spite extensive investigations1- intrinsic spectroscopic properties conjugated polymers precise conformational spatial arrangements remained elusive difficulties obtaining information endemic polymers often resist assembly single crystals organized structures owing entropic polydispersity considerations show conformation individual polymers interpolymer interactions conjugated polymers can controlled use designed surfactant polyp-phenylene-ethynylene langmuir films show mechanically inducing reversible conformational changes langmuir monolayers can obtain precise interrelationship intrinsic optical properties conjugated polymer single chains conformation and/or interpolymer interactions method controlling structure conjugated polymers establishing intrinsic spectroscopic properties permit comprehensive understanding fluorescent conjugated materials
