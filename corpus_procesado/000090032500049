actin-based motility bacterium listeria monocytogenes model system understanding motile cell functions involving actin polymerization although biochemical genetic aspects listeria motility intensely studied- biophysical data sparse used high-resolution laser tracking follow trailing ends listeria moving lamellae cos7 cells found pauses motility occur frequently episodes step-like motion often show pauses spaced nm corresponds spatial periodicity f-actin occasionally observed smaller steps < nm well periods motion obvious pauses clearly bacteria sense cytoplasmic viscoelasticity fluctuate times less adjacent lipid droplets instead bacteria bind actin tails anchoring proteins can step along growing filaments within actin tail positional fluctuations unusually small forces association propulsion must strong data disprove brownian ratchet model limit alternative models elastic brownian ratchet molecular ratchet
