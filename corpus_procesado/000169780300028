review: cosmochemistry early evolution inner solar system: meteoritic perspective 
formation solar system may triggered stellar wind solar system followed conventional evolutionary path including formation disk bipolar jets now extinct short-lived radionuclides beryllium- possibly manganese- present meteorites probably resulted energetic particle irradiation within solar system calcium-aluminum-rich inclusions oldest known solar system solids chondrules produced bipolar jets likely formed localized events asteroid belt chondritic meteorites formed within temperature range kelvin inferred midplane classical t tauri disks astronomical units central stars however meteorites may retain chemical memory earlier times midplane temperatures much higher dissipation solar nebula occurred within million years solar system formation whereas differentiation asteroidal-sized bodies occurred within million years terrestrial planets took similar million years form consequently accreted already differentiated bodies final assembly completed solar nebula dispersed implies water-bearing asteroids and/or icy planetesimals formed near jupiter likely sources earths water
