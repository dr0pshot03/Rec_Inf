progenitor outgrowth niche drosophila trachea guided fgf decaying branches
although progress identifying adult stem progenitor cells signals control proliferation differentiation little known substrates signals guide niche examining drosophila tracheal outgrowth metamorphosis show progenitors follow stereotyped path niche tracking along subset tracheal branches destined destruction embryonic tracheal inducer branchless fgf fibroblast growth factor expressed dynamically just ahead progenitor outgrowth decaying branches knockdown branchless abrogates progenitor outgrowth whereas misexpression redirects thus reactivation embryonic tracheal inducer decaying branches directs outgrowth progenitors replace explains structure newly generated tissue coordinated old
