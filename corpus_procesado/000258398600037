drosophila rnai screen identifies host genes important influenza virus replication 
viruses rely host cell proteins associated mechanisms complete viral life cycle identifying host molecules participate step virus replication provide valuable new targets antiviral therapy goal may take several decades achieve conventional forward genetic screening methods mammalian cell cultures describe novel genome-wide rna interference rnai screen drosophila can used identify host genes important influenza virus replication modifying influenza virus allow infection drosophila cells detection influenza virus gene expression tested rnai library genes % drosophila genome identifying suppression drosophila cells significantly inhibited stimulated reporter gene renilla luciferase expression influenza-virus-derived vector relevance findings influenza virus infection mammalian cells illustrated subset drosophila genes identified; three implicated drosophila genes corresponding human homologues atp6v0d1 cox6a1 nxf1 shown key functions replication h5n1 h1n1 influenza viruses vesicular stomatitis virus vaccinia virus human hek cells thus demonstrated feasibility using genome-wide rnai screens drosophila identify previously unrecognized host proteins required influenza virus replication accelerate development new classes antiviral drugs chemoprophylaxis treatment urgently needed given obstacles rapid development effective vaccine pandemic influenza probable emergence strains resistant available drugs
