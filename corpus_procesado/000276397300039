genome-wide snp haplotype analyses reveal rich history underlying dog domestication 
advances genome technology facilitated new understanding historical genetic processes crucial rapid phenotypic evolution domestication12 understand process dog diversification better conducted extensive genome-wide survey single nucleotide polymorphisms dogs wild progenitor grey wolf show dog breeds share higher proportion multi-locus haplotypes unique grey wolves middle east indicating dominant source genetic diversity dogs rather wolves east asia suggested mitochondrial dna sequence data3 furthermore find surprising correspondence genetic phenotypic/functional breed groupings exceptions suggest phenotypic diversification depended part repeated crossing individuals novel phenotypes results show middle eastern wolves critical source genome diversity although interbreeding local wolf populations clearly occurred elsewhere early history specific lineages recently evolution modern dog breeds seems iterative process drew limited genetic toolkit create remarkable phenotypic diversity
