species-specific calls evoke asymmetric activity monkeys temporal poles 
often proposed vocal calls monkeys precursors human speech part provide critical information members species rely survival social interactions behavioural lesion studies suggest monkeys like humans use auditory system left hemisphere preferentially process vocalizations investigate pattern neural activity might underlie particular form functional asymmetry monkeys measured local cerebral metabolic activity animals listened passively species-specific calls compared variety classes sound within superior temporal gyrus significantly greater metabolic activity occurred left side right region temporal pole response monkey calls functional asymmetry absent regions separated forebrain commissurotomy suggesting perception vocalizations elicits concurrent interhemispheric interactions focus auditory processing within specialized area one hemisphere
