non-optimal codon usage mechanism achieve circadian clock conditionality
circadian rhythms oscillations biological processes function key adaptation daily rhythms environments model cyanobacterial circadian clock system core oscillator proteins encoded gene cluster kaiabc genes high expression functional importance kai genes usually encoded optimal codons yet codon-usage bias kaibc genes optimized translational efficiency discovered relationship codon usage general property circadian rhythms called conditionality namely endogenous rhythmicity robustly expressed environmental conditions others despite generality circadian conditionality however molecular basis unknown system show cyanobacterium synechococcus elongate non-optimal codon usage selected post-transcriptional mechanism switch circadian non-circadian regulation gene expression adaptive response environmental conditions kaibc sequence experimentally optimized enhance expression kaib kaic proteins intrinsic rhythmicity enhanced cool temperatures experienced organism natural habitat however fitness temperatures highest cells hi endogenous rhythms suppressed cool temperatures compared cells exhibiting high-amplitude rhythmicity results indicate natural selection circadian systems cyanobacteria intrinsically robust cool temperatures modulation circadian amplitude therefore crucial adaptive significance moreover results show direct effects codon usage complex phenotype organismal fitness work also challenges long-standing view directional selection towards optimal codons- provides key example natural selection optimal codons achieve adaptive responses environmental changes
