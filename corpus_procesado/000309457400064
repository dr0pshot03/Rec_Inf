wnt5a potentiates tgf-beta signaling promote colonic crypt regeneration tissue injury
reestablishing homeostasis tissue damage depends proper organization stem cells progeny though repair mechanisms unclear mammalian intestinal epithelium well suited approach problem composed well-delineated units called crypts lieberkuhn found wnt5a noncanonical wnt ligand required crypt regeneration injury mice unlike controls wnt5a-deficient mice maintained expanded population proliferative epithelial cells wound used vitro system enrich intestinal epithelial stem cells discover wnt5a inhibited proliferation cells surprisingly effects wnt5a mediated activation transforming growth factor-beta tgf-beta signaling findings suggest wnt5a-dependent mechanism forming new crypt units reestablish homeostasis
