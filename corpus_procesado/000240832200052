volatile chemical cues guide host location host selection parasitic plants
importance plant volatiles mediating interactions plant species much debated demonstrate parasitic plant cuscuta pentagona dodder uses volatile cues host location cuscuta pentagona seedlings exhibit directed growth toward nearby tomato plants lycopersicon esculentum toward extracted tomato-plant volatiles presented absence cues impatiens impatiens wallerana wheat plants triticum aestivum also elicit directed growth moreover seedlings can distinguish tomato wheat volatiles preferentially grow toward former several individual compounds tomato wheat elicit directed growth c pentagona whereas one compound wheat repellent findings provide compelling evidence volatiles mediate important ecological interactions among plant species
