enhanced partner preference promiscuous species manipulating expression single gene
molecular mechanisms underlying evolution complex behaviour poorly understood mammalian genus microtus provides excellent model investigating evolution social behaviour prairie voles microtus ochrogaster exhibit monogamous social structure nature whereas closely related meadow voles microtus pennsylvanicus solitary polygamous male prairie voles vasopressin dopamine act ventral forebrain regulate selective affiliation adult mates known pair bond formation assessed partner preference laboratory- vasopressin v1a receptor v1ar expressed higher levels ventral forebrain monogamous promiscuous vole species whereas dopamine receptor distribution relatively conserved species substantially increase partner preference formation socially promiscuous meadow vole using viral vector v1ar gene transfer ventral forebrain show change expression single gene larger context pre-existing genetic neural circuits can profoundly alter social behaviour providing potential molecular mechanism rapid evolution complex social behaviour
