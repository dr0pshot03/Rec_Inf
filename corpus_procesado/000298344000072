cultured greigite-producing magnetotactic bacterium novel group sulfate-reducing bacteria 
magnetotactic bacteria contain magnetosomes-intracellular membrane-bounded magnetic nanocrystals magnetite fe3o4 greigite fe3s4-that cause bacteria swim along geomagnetic field lines isolated greigite-producing magnetotactic bacterium brackish spring death valley national park california usa strain bw- able biomineralize greigite magnetite depending culture conditions phylogenetic comparison bw- similar uncultured greigite and/or magnetite-producing magnetotactic bacteria freshwater hypersaline habitats shows organisms represent previously unknown group sulfate-reducing bacteria deltaproteobacteria genomic analysis bw- reveals presence two different magnetosome gene clusters suggesting one may responsible greigite biomineralization magnetite
