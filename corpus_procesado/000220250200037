structural relaxation supercooled water time-resolved spectroscopy 
water many kinetic thermodynamic properties exhibit anomalous dependence temperature1- particular supercooled phase anomalies long interpreted terms underlying structural causes experimental characterization points existence singularity temperature k insights nature origin singularity might gained completely characterizing structural relaxation supercooled water6 now characterization realized simulations7- agree predictions simple mode-coupling theory10; unambiguous experimental support surprising conclusion however yet available11- report time-resolved optical kerr effect measurements15 unambiguously demonstrate structural relaxation liquid weakly supercooled water follows behaviour predicted simple mode-coupling theory findings thus support interpretation7- singularity purely dynamical transition anomalous behaviour weakly supercooled water can explained using fully dynamic model without needing invoke thermodynamic origin regard water behaves like many normal molecular liquids fragile glass-formers
