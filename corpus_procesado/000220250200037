structural relaxation supercooled water time-resolved spectroscopy
water many kinetic thermodynamic properties exhibit anomalous dependence temperature- particular supercooled phase anomalies long interpreted terms underlying structural causes experimental characterization points existence singularity temperature k insights nature origin singularity might gained completely characterizing structural relaxation supercooled water now characterization realized simulations- agree predictions simple mode-coupling theory unambiguous experimental support surprising conclusion however yet available- report time-resolved optical kerr effect measurements unambiguously demonstrate structural relaxation liquid weakly supercooled water follows behaviour predicted simple mode-coupling theory findings thus support interpretation- singularity purely dynamical transition anomalous behaviour weakly supercooled water can explained using fully dynamic model without needing invoke thermodynamic origin regard water behaves like many normal molecular liquids fragile glass-formers
