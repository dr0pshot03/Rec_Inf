functional compartmentalization viewpoint generalization within macaque face-processing system
primates can recognize faces across range viewing conditions representations individual identity thus exist invariant accidental image transformations like view direction targeted recently discovered face-processing network macaque monkey consists six interconnected face-selective regions recorded two middle patches ml middle lateral mf middle fundus two anterior patches al anterior lateral anterior medial found anatomical position face patch associated unique functional identity: face patches differed qualitatively represented identity across head orientations neurons ml mf view-specific neurons al tuned identity mirror-symetrically across views thus achieving partial view invariance neurons anterior face patch achieved almost full view invariance
