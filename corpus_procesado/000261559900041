negative feedback improves information transmission yeast signalling
haploid saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast cells use prototypic cell signalling system transmit information extracellular concentration mating pheromone secreted potential mating partners ability cells respond distinguishably different pheromone concentrations depends much information pheromone concentration system can transmit show mitogen activated protein kinase fus3 mediates fast acting negative feedback adjusts dose response downstream system response match dose response receptor ligand binding ` dose response alignment defined linear relationship receptor occupancy downstream response can improve fidelity information transmission making downstream responses corresponding different receptor occupancies distinguishable reducing amplification stochastic noise signal transmission also show one target feedback previously uncharacterized signal promoting function regulator g protein signalling protein sst2 work suggests negative feedback general mechanism used signalling systems align dose responses thereby increase fidelity information transmission
