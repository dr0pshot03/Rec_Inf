active fluidization polymer networks molecular motors 
entangled polymer solutions melts exhibit elastic solid-like resistance quick deformations viscous fluid-like response slow deformations viscoelastic behaviour reflects dynamics individual polymer chains driven brownian motion : since individual chains can move snake-like fashion mesh surrounding polymer molecules diffusive transport described reptation-is slow relaxation suddenly imposed stress delayed entangled polymer solutions melts therefore elastically resist deforming motions occur faster stress relaxation time show protein myosin ii permits active control viscoelastic behaviour actin filament solutions find actin filament polymerized actin solution interacts least one myosin minifilament stress relaxation time polymer solution significantly shortened attribute effect myosins action molecular motor allows interact randomly oriented actin filaments push solution thus enhancing longitudinal filament motion superseding reptation sliding motion molecular motors thus overcome fundamental principle complex fluids: depolymerization makes entangled isotropic polymer solution fluid quick deformations
