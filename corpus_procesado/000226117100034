similar response labile resistant soil organic matter pools changes temperature 
understanding relationship decomposition soil organic matter som soil temperature affects predictions impact climate change soil-stored carbon1 one current opinion decomposition soil labile carbon sensitive temperature variation whereas resistant components insensitive2- resistant carbon organic matter mineral soil assumed unresponsive global warming24 global pattern magnitude predicted future soil carbon stock will mainly rely temperature sensitivity resistant carbon pools investigate sensitivity incubated soils changing temperature report som decomposition soil basal respiration rate significantly affected changes som components associated soil depth sampling method incubation time find however temperature sensitivity som decomposition affected suggesting temperature sensitivity resistant organic matter pools differ significantly labile pools types som will therefore respond similarly global warming
