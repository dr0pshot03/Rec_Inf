antigen produced splicing noncontiguous peptides reverse order 
cd8-positive t lymphocytes recognize peptides usually derived degradation cellular proteins presented class molecules major histocompatibility complex describe human minor histocompatibility antigen created polymorphism sp110 nuclear phosphoprotein gene antigenic peptide comprises two noncontiguous sp110 peptide segments spliced together reverse order occur predicted sp110 protein antigenic peptide produced vitro incubation precursor peptides highly purified 20s proteasomes cutting splicing probably occur within proteasome transpeptidation
