electronics using hybrid-molecular mono-molecular devices
semiconductor industry seen remarkable miniaturization trend driven many scientific technological innovations trend continue provide ever faster cheaper computers size microelectronic circuit components will soon need reach scale atoms molecules-a goal will require conceptually new device structures idea molecules even single molecule embedded electrodes perform basic functions digital electronics-rectification amplification storage-was first put forward mid-1970s concept now realized individual components economic fabrication complete circuits molecular level remains challenging difficulty connecting molecules one another possible solution problem mono-molecular electronics single molecule will integrate elementary functions interconnections required computation
