endosomal chloride-proton exchange rather chloride conductance crucial renal endocytosis 
loss endosomal anion transport protein clc- impairs renal endocytosis underlies human dents disease clc- thought promote endocytosis facilitating endosomal acidification neutralization proton pump currents however clc- chloride cl-/proton h+ exchanger rather cl- channel generated mice carry uncoupling e211a unc mutation converts clc- pure cl- conductor adenosine triphosphate atp-dependent acidification renal endosomes reduced mice clc- knocked normal clcn5unc mice however proximal tubular endocytosis also impaired thus endosomal chloride concentration raised clc- exchange protons accumulated h+-atpase may play role endocytosis
