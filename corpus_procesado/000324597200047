constitutive mu-opioid receptor activity leads long-term endogenous analgesia dependence
opioid receptor antagonists increase hyperalgesia humans animals indicates endogenous activation opioid receptors provides relief acute pain however mechanisms long-term opioid inhibition pathological pain remained elusive found tissue injury produced mu-opioid receptor mor constitutive activity morca repressed spinal nociceptive signaling months pharmacological blockade posthyperalgesia state mor inverse agonists reinstated central pain sensitization precipitated hallmarks opioid withdrawal including adenosine -monophosphate overshoot hyperalgesia required n-methyl-d-aspartate receptor activation adenylyl cyclase type thus morca initiates analgesic signaling compensatory opponent process generates endogenous opioid dependence tonic morca suppression withdrawal hyperalgesia may prevent transition acute chronic pain
