ecological opportunity sexual selection together predict adaptive radiation
fundamental challenge understanding biodiversity explain groups species undergo adaptive radiations diversifying extensively many varied species whereas others extrinsic environmental factors example resource availability climate intrinsic lineage-specific traits example behavioural morphological traits genetic architecture influence diversification studies addressed factors interact radiations cichlid fishes african great lakes provide dramatic cases species diversification however cichlid lineages african lakes undergone adaptive radiations compile data cichlid colonization diversification african lakes along lake environmental features information traits colonizing cichlid lineages investigate adaptive radiation occur find extrinsic environmental factors related ecological opportunity intrinsic lineage-specific traits related sexual selection strongly influence whether cichlids radiate cichlids likely radiate deep lakes regions incident solar radiation lakes time diversification weak negative associations diversification lake surface area indicate cichlid speciation constrained area contrast diversification many terrestrial taxa among suite intrinsic traits investigate sexual dichromatism surrogate intensity sexual selection consistently positively associated diversification thus cichlids coincidence ecological opportunity sexual selection best predicts whether adaptive radiation will occur findings suggest adaptive radiation predictable species traits environmental factors jointly considered
