autism-related deficits via dysregulated eif4e-dependent translational control 
hyperconnectivity neuronal circuits due increased synaptic protein synthesis thought cause autism spectrum disorders asds mammalian target rapamycin mtor strongly implicated asds means upstream signalling however downstream regulatory mechanisms ill-defined show knockout eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4e-binding protein 4e-bp2-an eif4e repressor downstream mtor-or eif4e overexpression leads increased translation neuroligins postsynaptic proteins causally linked asds mice gene encoding 4e-bp2 eif4ebp2 knocked exhibit increased ratio excitatory inhibitory synaptic inputs autistic-like behaviours social interaction deficits altered communication repetitive/stereotyped behaviours pharmacological inhibition eif4e activity normalization neuroligin neuroligin protein levels restores normal excitation/inhibition ratio rectifies social behaviour deficits thus translational control eif4e regulates synthesis neuroligins maintaining excitation-to-inhibition balance dysregulation engenders asd-like phenotypes
