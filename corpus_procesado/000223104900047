structural basis mitochondrial tethering mitofusin complexes
vesicle fusion involves vesicle tethering docking membrane merger show mitofusin integral mitochondrial membrane protein required adjacent mitochondria mediate fusion indicates mitofusin complexes act trans adjacent mitochondria heptad repeat region hr2 mediates mitofusin oligomerization assembling dimeric antiparallel coiled coil transmembrane segments located opposite ends angstrom coiled coil provide mechanism organelle tethering consistent proposal truncated mitofusin hr2-dependent manner causes mitochondria become apposed uniform gap results suggest hr2 functions mitochondrial tether fusion
