radio-frequency spectroscopy ultracold fermions
radio-frequency techniques used study ultracold fermions observed absence mean-field clock shifts dominant source systematic error current atomic clocks based bosonic atoms absence direct consequence fermionic antisymmetry resonance shifts proportional interaction strengths observed three-level system however strongly interacting regime shifts became small reflecting quantum unitarity limit many-body effects insight interacting fermi gas relevant quest observe superfluidity system
