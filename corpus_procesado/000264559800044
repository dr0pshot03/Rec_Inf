quantitative 3d video microscopy hiv transfer across t cell virological synapses 
spread hiv immune cells greatly enhanced cell-cell adhesions called virological synapses although underlying mechanisms unclear use infectious fluorescent clone hiv tracked movement gag live cd4 t cells captured direct translocation hiv across virological synapse quantitative high-speed three-dimensional 3d video microscopy revealed rapid formation micrometer-sized "buttons" containing oligomerized viral gag protein electron microscopy showed buttons packed budding viral crescents viral transfer events observed form virus-laden internal compartments within target cells continuous time-lapse monitoring showed preferential infection synapses thus hiv dissemination may enhanced virological synapse-mediated cell adhesion coupled viral endocytosis
