endothelial perivascular cells maintain haematopoietic stem cells 
several cell types proposed create niches haematopoietic stem cells hscs however expression patterns hsc maintenance factors systematically studied factor conditionally deleted candidate niche cell thus cellular sources factors undetermined stem cell factor scf; also known kitl key niche component maintains hscs using scfgfp knock-in mice found scf primarily expressed perivascular cells throughout bone marrow hsc frequency function affected scf conditionally deleted haematopoietic cells osteoblasts nestin-cre nestin-creer-expressing cells however hscs depleted bone marrow scf deleted endothelial cells leptin receptor lepr-expressing perivascular stromal cells hscs lost scf deleted endothelial lepr-expressing perivascular cells thus hscs reside perivascular niche multiple cell types express factors promote hsc maintenance
