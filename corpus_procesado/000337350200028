single-cell rna-seq reveals dynamic paracrine control cellular variation 
high-throughput single-cell transcriptomics offers unbiased approach understanding extent basis function gene expression variation seemingly identical cells sequence single-cell rna-seq libraries prepared primary mouse bone-marrow-derived dendritic cells spanning several experimental conditions find substantial variation identically stimulated dendritic cells fraction cells detectably expressing given messenger rna transcripts level within expressing cells distinct gene modules characterized different temporal heterogeneity profiles particular core module antiviral genes expressed early precocious cells response uniform stimulation pathogenic component later activated cells stimulating cells individually sealed microfluidic chambers analysing dendritic cells knockout mice modulating secretion extracellular signalling show response coordinated interferon-mediated paracrine signalling precocious cells notably preventing cell-to-cell communication also substantially reduces variability cells expression early-induced peaked inflammatory module suggesting paracrine signalling additionally represses part inflammatory program study highlights importance cell-to-cell communication controlling cellular heterogeneity reveals general strategies multicellular populations can use establish complex dynamic responses
