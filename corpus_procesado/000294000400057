rapid range shifts species associated high levels climate warming
distributions many terrestrial organisms currently shifting latitude elevation response changing climate using meta-analysis estimated distributions species recently shifted higher elevations median rate meters per decade higher latitudes median rate kilometers per decade rates approximately two three times faster previously reported distances moved species greatest studies showing highest levels warming average latitudinal shifts generally sufficient track temperature changes however individual species vary greatly rates change suggesting range shift species depends multiple internal species traits external drivers change rapid average shifts derive wide diversity responses individual species
