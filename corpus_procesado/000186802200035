attosecond synchronization high-harmonic soft x-rays
subfemtosecond light pulses can obtained superposing several high harmonics intense laser pulse provided harmonics emitted simultaneously increasing number result shorter pulses however found high harmonics synchronized attosecond time scale thus setting lower limit achievable x-ray pulse duration showed synchronization improved considerably controlling underlying ultrafast electron dynamics provide pulses attoseconds duration discuss possibility achieving even shorter pulses allow us trackfast electron processes matter
