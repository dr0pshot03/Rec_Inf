interstitial dendritic cell guidance haptotactic chemokine gradients 
directional guidance cells via gradients chemokines considered crucial embryonic development cancer dissemination immune responses nevertheless concept still lacks direct experimental confirmation vivo identify endogenous gradients chemokine ccl21 within mouse skin show guide dendritic cells toward lymphatic vessels quantitative imaging reveals depots ccl21 within lymphatic endothelial cells steeply decaying gradients within perilymphatic interstitium gradients match migratory patterns dendritic cells directionally approach vessels distance -micrometers interstitial ccl21 immobilized heparan sulfates experimental delocalization swamping endogenous gradients abolishes directed migration findings functionally establish concept haptotaxis directed migration along immobilized gradients tissues
