oleylethanolamide regulates feeding body weight activation nuclear receptor ppar-alpha 
oleylethanolamide oea naturally occurring lipid regulates satiety body weight12 although structurally related endogenous cannabinoid anandamide oea bind cannabinoid receptors molecular targets defined show oea binds high affinity peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor-alpha ppar-alpha nuclear receptor regulates several aspects lipid metabolism administration oea produces satiety reduces body weight gain wild-type mice mice deficient ppar-alpha two distinct ppar-alpha agonists similar effects also contingent ppar-alpha expression whereas potent selective agonists ppar-gamma ppar-beta/delta ineffective small intestine wild-type ppar-alpha-null mice oea regulates expression several ppar-alpha target genes: initiates transcription proteins involved lipid metabolism represses inducible nitric oxide synthase enzyme may contribute feeding stimulation results show oea induces satiety activating ppar-alpha identify unexpected role nuclear receptor regulating behaviour raise possibilities treatment eating disorders
