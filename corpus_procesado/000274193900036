hsp90 prevents phenotypic variation suppressing mutagenic activity transposons 
canalization concept describes resistance developmental process phenotypic variation regardless genetic environmental perturbations owing existence buffering mechanisms severe perturbations overcome buffering mechanisms produce altered phenotypes can heritable can canalized genetic assimilation process important implication concept buffering mechanism genetically controlled recent studies hsp90 protein involved several cellular processes development pathways- indicate possible molecular mechanism canalization genetic assimilation flies plants mutations hsp90-encoding gene induce wide range phenotypic abnormalities interpreted increased sensitivity different developmental pathways hidden genetic variability thus hsp90 chaperone machinery may evolutionarily conserved buffering mechanism phenotypic variance provides genetic material natural selection offer additional perhaps alternative explanation proposals concrete mechanism underlying canalization show drosophila functional alterations hsp90 affect piwi-interacting rna pirna class germ-line-specific small rnas silencing mechanism leading transposon activation induction morphological mutants indicates hsp90 mutations can generate new variation transposon-mediated canonical mutagenesis
