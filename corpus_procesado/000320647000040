protein equilibration somatic ring canals drosophila 
although intercellular bridges resulting incomplete cytokinesis discovered somatic drosophila tissues decades ago impact structures intercellular communication tissue biology largely unknown work demonstrate similar nanometer-diameter somatic ring canals permit diffusion cytoplasmic contents connected cells across mitotic clone boundaries enable equilibration protein transcriptionally mosaic follicle cells drosophila ovary obtained similar although restricted results larval imaginal discs work illustrates lack cytoplasmic autonomy tissues suggests role somatic ring canals promoting homogeneous protein expression within tissue
