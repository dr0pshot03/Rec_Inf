equilibrium-dependent retroviral mrna switch regulates translational recoding
retroviruses require translational recoding viral messenger rna stop codon maintain precise ratio structural gag enzymatic pol proteins virus assembly pol expressed exclusively gag-pol fusion either ribosomal frameshifting read-through gag stop codon mechanisms occur infrequently affect % translating ribosomes allowing virus maintain critical gag gag-pol ratio- although understood frequency recoding event regulated cis rna motifs mechanistic explanation currently available critical protein ratio maintained present nmr structure murine leukaemia virus recoding signal show protonation-dependent switch occurs induce active conformation equilibrium physiological ph active read-through permissive conformation populated approximately %: level correlates vivo protein quantities rna functions highly sensitive chemo-mechanical coupling tuned ensure optimal read-through frequency similar observations frameshifting signal indicate novel equilibrium-based mechanism may general role translational recoding
