ultralow friction carbonate faults caused thermal decomposition 
high-velocity weakening faults may drive fault motion large earthquakes experiments simulated faults carrara marble slip rates meters per second demonstrate thermal decomposition calcite due frictional heating induces pronounced fault weakening steady-state friction coefficients low decomposition produces particles tens nanometers size ultralow friction appears associated flash heating ultrafine decomposition product thus thermal decomposition may important process dynamic weakening faults
