dynamical fracture instabilities due local hyperelasticity crack tips 
speed crack propagating brittle material increases dynamical instability leads increased roughening fracture surface cracks moving low speeds create atomically flat mirror-like surfaces higher speeds rougher less reflective mist finally rough irregularly faceted hackle surfaces- formed behaviour observed many different brittle materials underlying physical principles though extensively debated remain unresolved- existing theories fracture- assume linear elastic stress-strain law however relation stress strain real solids strongly nonlinear due large deformations near moving crack tip phenomenon referred hyperelasticity- use massively parallel large-scale atomistic simulations-employing simple atomistic material model allows systematic transition linear elastic strongly nonlinear behaviour-to show hyperelasticity plays governing role onset instability report generalized model describes onset instability competition different mechanisms controlled local stress field- local energy flow near crack tip results indicate instabilities intrinsic dynamical fracture help explain range controversial experimental- computational- results
