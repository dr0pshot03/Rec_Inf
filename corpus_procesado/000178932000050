colloidosomes: selectively permeable capsules composed colloidal particles 
present approach fabricate solid capsules precise control size permeability mechanical strength compatibility capsules fabricated self-assembly colloidal particles onto interface emulsion droplets particles locked together form elastic shells emulsion droplets transferred fresh continuous-phase fluid inside droplets resultant structures call "colloidosomes" hollow elastic shells whose permeability elasticity can precisely controlled generality robustness structures potential cellular immunoisolation demonstrated use variety solvents particles contents
