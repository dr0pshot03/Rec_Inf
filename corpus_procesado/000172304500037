non-fermi-liquid nature normal state itinerant-electron ferromagnets 
century research magnetic phenomena led view normal state itinerant-electron ferromagnets fe ni co described terms standard model metallic state extension known nearly ferromagnetic fermi liquid theory- recent years however large body observations accumulated various complex intermetallic systems raises possibility assumption might wrong examine issue means high-precision measurements electrical transport magnetic properties pure ferromagnets-in particular mnsi-in curie temperature tuned towards absolute zero application hydrostatic pressure method possible us study normal state extraordinarily large range temperature five orders magnitude curie temperature results using mnsi reveal particularly striking combination properties-most notably t-/ power law resistivity-showing clearly normal state itinerant-electron ferromagnet described terms standard model metals
