termite mounds can increase robustness dryland ecosystems climatic change
self-organized spatial vegetation patterning widespread described using models scale-dependent feedback plants water homogeneous substrates rainfall decreases models yield characteristic sequence patterns increasingly sparse vegetation followed sudden collapse desert thus final spot-like pattern may provide early warning catastrophic shifts many arid ecosystems however termite nests impart substrate heterogeneity altering soil properties thereby enhancing plant growth show termite-induced heterogeneity interacts scale-dependent feedbacks produce vegetation patterns different spatial grains although coarse-grained patterning resembles created scale-dependent feedback alone indicate imminent desertification rather mound-field landscapes robust aridity suggesting termites may help stabilize ecosystems global change
