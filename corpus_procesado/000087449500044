glass transition can viewed simply point viscosity structurally disordered liquid reaches universal threshold value1 operational definition circumvents fundamental issues whether glass transition purely dynamical phenomenon2 ergodicity gets broken system becomes confined part phase space thermodynamic properties liquid remain unchanged across transition provided determined thermodynamic equilibrium averages whole phase space opposite view3- claims underlying thermodynamic phase transition responsible pronounced slow-down dynamics liquid-glass boundary phase transition trigger dynamic standstill masked perform monte carlo simulations two-dimensional system polydisperse hard disks far within glassy phase approach7 allows non-local moves way preserves micro-reversibility find evidence thermodynamic phase transition high densities; glass thus indistinguishable liquid purely thermodynamic grounds
