targeted investigation neandertal genome array-based sequence capture
now possible perform whole-genome shotgun sequencing well capture specific genomic regions extinct organisms however targeted resequencing large parts nuclear genomes yet demonstrated ancient dna show hybridization capture microarrays can successfully recover megabase target regions neandertal dna even presence similar % microbial dna using approach sequenced similar protein-coding positions inferred changed human lineage since last common ancestor shared chimpanzees generating sequence one neandertal present-day humans positions identified amino acid substitutions become fixed humans since divergence neandertals
