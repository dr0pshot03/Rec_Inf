synfire chains cortical songs: temporal modules cortical activity
can neural activity propagate cortical networks built weak stochastic synapses find precise repetitions spontaneous patterns synaptic inputs neocortical neurons vivo vitro patterns repeat minutes maintaining millisecond accuracy calcium imaging slices reveals reactivation sequences cells occurrence repeated intracellular synaptic patterns spontaneous activity drifts time engaging different cells sequences active neurons distinct spatial structures repeated order tens seconds revealing modular temporal dynamics higher order sequences replayed compressed timing
