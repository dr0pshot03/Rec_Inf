nonenzymatic template-directed rna synthesis inside model protocells 
efforts recreate prebiotically plausible protocell rna replication occurs within fatty acid vesicle stalled destabilizing effect mg2+ fatty acid membranes report presence citrate protects fatty acid membranes disruptive effects high mg2+ ion concentrations allowing rna copying proceed also protecting single-stranded rna mg2+-catalyzed degradation combination properties allowed us demonstrate chemical copying rna templates inside fatty acid vesicles turn allows increase copying efficiency bathing vesicles continuously refreshed solution activated nucleotides
