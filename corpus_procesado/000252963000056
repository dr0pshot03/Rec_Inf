colossal positive negative thermal expansion framework material ag-[cocn]
show silver hexacyanocobaltateiii ag-[cocn] exhibits positive negative thermal expansion order magnitude greater seen crystalline materials framework material expands along one set directions rate comparable weakly bound solids known flexing like lattice fencing framework couples contraction along perpendicular direction gives negative thermal expansion times larger zrw2o8 density functional theory calculations quantify low energy associated flexibility role argentophilic ag+ag+ interactions study illustrates mechanical properties van der waals solid might engineered rigid useable framework
