drosophila life span physiology modulated sexual perception reward 
sensory perception can modulate aging physiology across taxa found perception female sexual pheromones specific gustatory receptor expressed subset foreleg neurons male fruit flies drosophila melanogaster rapidly reversibly decreases fat stores reduces resistance starvation limits life span neurons express reward-mediating neuropeptide f also required pheromone effects high-throughput whole-genome rna sequencing experiments revealed set molecular processes affected activity longevity circuit thereby identifying new candidate cell-nonautonomous aging mechanisms mating reversed effects pheromone perception; therefore life span may modulated integrated action sensory reward circuits healthy aging may compromised expectations defined sensory perception discordant ensuing experience
