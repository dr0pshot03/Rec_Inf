il-21r t cells critical sustained functionality control chronic viral infection
chronic viral infection often associated dysfunction virus-specific t cells studies using il21r-deficient il21r-/- mice now suggest interleukin il- critical long-term maintenance functionality cd8+ t cells control chronic lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infection mice cell-autonomous il receptor il-21r-dependent signaling cd8+ t cells required sustained cell proliferation cytokine production chronic infection il21r-/- mice showed normal cd8+ t cell expansion effector function memory homeostasis recall responses acute resolved infection several nonpersistent viruses data suggest il-21r signaling required maintenance polyfunctional t cells chronic viral infections implications understanding immune response persisting antigens tumors
