density hydrous silicate melt conditions earths deep upper mantle
chemical evolution earth terrestrial planets largely controlled density silicate melts melt density higher surrounding solid incompatible elements dissolved melt will sequestered deep mantle previous studies dry water-free melts showed density silicate melts can higher surrounding solids deep mantle conditions- however melts formed deep mantle conditions also likely contain water will reduce melt density present data constraining density hydrous silicate melt conditions similar km depth show water silicate melt compressible components therefore effect water reducing melt density markedly diminished high-pressure conditions study indicates range conditions hydrous melt trapped km boundary hence incompatible elements sequestered deep mantle although conditions sensitive melt composition well composition surrounding mantle
