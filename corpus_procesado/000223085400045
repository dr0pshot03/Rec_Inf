kin selection theory predicts individuals will show less aggression altruism towards relatives however recent theoretical developments suggest limited dispersal competition relatives can override effects relatedness- predicted opposing influences relatedness competition difficult approach experimentally conditions increase average relatedness among individuals also tend increase competition polyembryonic wasps family encyrtidae parasites whose eggs undergo clonal division produce large broods insects also evolved caste system: embryos clone develop reproductive larvae mature adults whereas others develop sterile soldier larvae defend siblings competitors- brood single egg reproductive altruism soldiers reflects clone-level allocation defence cost reproduction conflict individuals multiple eggs laid host inter-clone conflicts interest arise report soldier aggression copidosoma floridanum inversely related genetic relatedness competitors shows correlation level resource competition
