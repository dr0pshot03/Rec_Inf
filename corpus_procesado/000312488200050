josephson heat interferometer
josephson effect perhaps prototypical manifestation macroscopic phase coherence forms basis widely used electronic interferometer-the superconducting quantum interference device squid maki griffin predicted thermal current temperature-biased josephson tunnel junction coupling two superconductors stationary periodic function quantum phase difference superconductors: temperature-biased squid therefore allow heat currents interfere resulting thermal version electric josephson interferometer phase-dependent mechanism thermal transport subject much discussion- surprisingly yet realized experimentally investigate heat exchange two normal metal electrodes kept different temperatures tunnel-coupled thermal modulator ref form direct-current squid find heat transport system phase dependent agreement original prediction josephson heat interferometer yields magnetic-flux-dependent temperature oscillations millikelvin amplitude provides flux-to-temperature transfer coefficient exceeding millikelvin per flux quantum millikelvin addition confirming existence phase-dependent thermal current unique josephson junctions results point way towards phase-coherent manipulation heat solid-state nanocircuits
