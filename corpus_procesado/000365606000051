measuring entanglement entropy quantum many-body system 
entanglement one intriguing features quantum mechanics describes non-local correlations quantum objects heart quantum information sciences entanglement now studied diverse fields ranging condensed matter quantum gravity however measuring entanglement remains challenge especially systems interacting delocalized particles direct experimental measurement spatial entanglement elusive measure entanglement system itinerant particles using quantum interference many-body twins making use single-site-resolved control ultracold bosonic atoms optical lattices prepare two identical copies many-body state interfere enables us directly measure quantum purity renyi entanglement entropy mutual information experiments pave way using entanglement characterize quantum phases dynamics strongly correlated many-body systems
