aryl hydrocarbon receptor links th-cell-mediated autoimmunity environmental toxins
aryl hydrocarbon receptor ahr ligand dependent transcription factor best known mediating toxicity dioxin environmental factors believed contribute increased prevalence autoimmune diseases many due activity th t cells new helper t cell subset characterized production cytokine il show cd4+ t cell lineage mice ahr expression restricted th cell subset ligation results production th cytokine interleukin il ahr also expressed human th cells activation ahr high-affinity ligand th cell development markedly increases proportion th t cells production cytokines cd4+ t cells ahr deficient mice can develop th cell responses confronted ahr ligand fail produce il show enhanced th cell development ahr activation induction experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis causes accelerated onset increased pathology wild type mice ahr deficient mice ahr ligands may therefore represent co factors development autoimmune diseases
