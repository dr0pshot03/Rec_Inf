aryl hydrocarbon receptor links th17-cell-mediated autoimmunity environmental toxins 
aryl hydrocarbon receptor ahr ligand dependent transcription factor best known mediating toxicity dioxin1 environmental factors believed contribute increased prevalence autoimmune diseases many due activity th17 t cells new helper t cell subset characterized production cytokine il show cd4+ t cell lineage mice ahr expression restricted th17 cell subset ligation results production th17 cytokine interleukin il ahr also expressed human th17 cells activation ahr high-affinity ligand th17 cell development markedly increases proportion th17 t cells production cytokines cd4+ t cells ahr deficient mice can develop th17 cell responses confronted ahr ligand fail produce il show enhanced th17 cell development ahr activation induction experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis causes accelerated onset increased pathology wild type mice ahr deficient mice ahr ligands may therefore represent co factors development autoimmune diseases
