iron partitioning earths mantle: toward deep lower mantle discontinuity 
measured spin state iron ferropericlase mg083fe017o high pressure found high-spin low-spin transition occurring -gigapascal pressure range corresponding depths kilometers earths lower mantle transition implies partition coefficient iron ferropericlase magnesium silicate perovskite two main constituents lower mantle may increase several orders magnitude depleting perovskite phase iron lower mantle may composed two different layers upper layer consist phase mixture equal partitioning iron magnesium silicate perovskite ferropericlase whereas lower layer consist almost iron-free perovskite iron-rich ferropericlase strati cation likely profound implications transport properties earths lowermost mantle
