endangered plants persist phosphorus limitation
nitrogen enrichment widely thought responsible loss plant species temperate terrestrial ecosystems view based field surveys controlled experiments showing species richness correlates negatively high productivity nitrogen enrichment however type nutrient limitation never examined large geographical scale causality relationships uncertain investigated species richness herbaceous terrestrial ecosystems sampled along transect temperate eurasia represented gradient declining levels atmospheric nitrogen deposition similar kg ha- yr- western europe natural background values less kg ha- yr- siberia show many endangered plant species persist phosphorus limited nitrogen limited conditions conclude enhanced phosphorus likely cause species loss nitrogen enrichment results highlight need better understanding mechanisms phosphorus enrichment stronger focus conservation management reduce phosphorus availability
