locally synchronized synaptic inputs
synaptic inputs dendrites nonlinearly converted action potential outputs yet spatiotemporal patterns dendritic activation remain elucidated single-synapse resolution rodents optically imaged synaptic activities hundreds dendritic spines hippocampal neocortical pyramidal neurons ex vivo vivo adjacent spines frequently synchronized spontaneously active networks thereby forming dendritic foci received locally convergent inputs presynaptic cell assemblies precise subcellular geometry manifested n-methyl-d-aspartate receptor-dependent circuit remodeling thus clustered synaptic plasticity innately programmed compartmentalize correlated inputs along dendrites may reify nonlinear synaptic integration
