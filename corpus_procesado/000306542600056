regional astrocyte allocation regulates cns synaptogenesis repair
astrocytes abundant cell population central nervous system cns essential normal neurological function show astrocytes allocated spatial domains mouse spinal cord brain accordance embryonic sites origin ventricular zone domains remain stable throughout life without evidence secondary tangential migration even acute cns injury domain-specific depletion astrocytes ventral spinal cord resulted abnormal motor neuron synaptogenesis rescued immigration astrocytes adjoining regions findings demonstrate region-restricted astrocyte allocation general cns phenomenon reveal intrinsic limitations astroglial response injury
