long-term plasticity hippocampal place-cell representation environmental geometry 
hippocampus widely believed involved storage consolidation long-term memories1- several reports shown short-term changes single hippocampal unit activity memory plasticity experiments5- experimental demonstration long-term persistent changes neuronal activity region except primary cortical areas13- report rats repeatedly exposed two differently shaped environments hippocampal-place-cell representations environments gradually incrementally diverge; divergence specific environmental shape occurs independently explicit reward persists periods least one month transfers new enclosures shape results indicate place cells may neural substrate long-term incidental learning demonstrate long-term stability experience-dependent firing pattern hippocampal formation
