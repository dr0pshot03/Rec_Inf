melt segregation strain partitioning: implications seismic anisotropy mantle flow
one principal means understanding upper mantle dynamics involves inferring mantle flow directions seismic anisotropy assumption seismic fast direction olivine axis parallels regional flow direction demonstrate presence melt weakens alignment axes ii melt segregates forms networks weak shear zones strain partitions weak strong zones resulting alignment axes 90degrees shear direction three-dimensional deformation orientation axes provides new means interpreting mantle flow seismic anisotropy partially molten deforming regions earth
