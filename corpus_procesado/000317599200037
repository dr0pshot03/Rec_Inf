rescuing cocaine-induced prefrontal cortex hypoactivity prevents compulsive cocaine seeking 
loss control harmful drug seeking one intractable aspects addiction human substance abusers continue pursue drugs despite incurring significant negative consequences1 human studies suggested deficits prefrontal cortical function consequential loss inhibitory control2- crucial promoting compulsive drug use however remains unknown whether chronic drug use compromises cortical activity equally important whether deficit promotes compulsive cocaine seeking use rat model compulsive drug seeking5- cocaine seeking persists subgroup rats despite delivery noxious foot shocks show prolonged cocaine self-administration decreases ex vivo intrinsic excitability deep-layer pyramidal neurons prelimbic cortex significantly pronounced compulsive drug-seeking animals furthermore compensating hypoactive prelimbic cortex neurons vivo optogenetic prelimbic cortex stimulation significantly prevented compulsive cocaine seeking whereas optogenetic prelimbic cortex inhibition significantly increased compulsive cocaine seeking results show marked reduction prelimbic cortex excitability compulsive cocaine-seeking rats vivo optogenetic prelimbic cortex stimulation decreased compulsive drug-seeking behaviours thus targeted stimulation prefrontal cortex serve promising therapy treating compulsive drug use
