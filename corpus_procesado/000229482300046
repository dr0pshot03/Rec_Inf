microbial arsenic cycle salt-saturated extreme environment 
searles lake salt-saturated alkaline brine unusually rich toxic element arsenic arsenic speciation changed arsenate [asv] arsenite asiii sediment depth incubated anoxic sediment slurries displayed dissimilatory asv-reductase activity markedly stimulated h sulfide whereas aerobic slurries rapid asiii-oxidase activity anaerobic extremely haloalkaliphilic bacterium isolated sediment grew via asv respiration using either lactate sulfide electron donor hence full biogeochemical cycle arsenic occurs searles lake driven part inorganic electron donors
