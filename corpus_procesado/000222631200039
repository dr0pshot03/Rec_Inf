combined effects pathogens predators insect outbreaks 
economic damage caused episodic outbreaks forest-defoliating insects spurred much research yet outbreaks occur remains unclear theoretical biologists argue outbreaks driven specialist pathogens parasitoids host-pathogen host-parasitoid models show large-amplitude long-period cycles resembling time series outbreaks field biologists counter outbreaks occur generalist predators fail predation low-density defoliator populations usually high enough prevent outbreaks- neither explanation sufficient however time outbreaks data far variable host-pathogen host-parasitoid models far shorter generalist-predator models- show insect outbreaks can explained model includes generalist predator specialist pathogen host pathogen-predator model stochasticity causes defoliator densities fluctuate erratically equilibrium maintained predator cycles driven pathogen outbreaks model occur long irregular intervals matching data results suggest explanations insect outbreaks must go beyond classical models consider interactions among multiple species
