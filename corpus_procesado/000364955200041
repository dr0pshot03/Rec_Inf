efficient stable large-area perovskite solar cells inorganic charge extraction layers 
recent dramatic rise power conversion efficiencies pces perovskite solar cells pscs triggered intense research worldwide however high pce values often reached poor stability illuminated area typically less square centimeter used heavily doped inorganic charge extraction layers planar pscs achieve rapid carrier extraction even -nanometer-thick layers avoiding pinholes eliminating local structural defects large areas robust inorganic nature layers allowed fabrication pscs aperture area > square centimeter pce >% certified accredited photovoltaic calibration laboratory hysteresis current-voltage characteristics eliminated; pscs stable >% initial pce remaining hours light soaking
