giant nonlocality near dirac point graphene 
transport measurements powerful tool discovering electronic phenomena graphene report nonlocal measurements performed hall bar geometry voltage probes far away classical path charge flow observed large nonlocal response near dirac point fields low tesla persisted room temperature nonlocality consistent long-range flavor currents induced lifting spin/valley degeneracy effect expected contribute strongly magnetotransport phenomena near neutrality point
