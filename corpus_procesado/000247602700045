restriction dna replication reductive phase metabolic cycle protects genome integrity 
prototrophic yeast cells cultured nutrient-limited conditions mimic growth wild rather high-glucose solutions used laboratory studies exhibit robustly periodic metabolic cycle cycle hours yeast cells rhythmically alternate glycolysis respiration cell division cycle tightly constrained reductive phase yeast metabolic cycle dna replication taking place glycolytic phase show cell cycle mutants impeded metabolic cycle-directed restriction cell division exhibit substantial increases spontaneous mutation rate addition disruption gene encoding dna checkpoint kinase couples cell division cycle circadian cycle abolishes synchrony metabolic cell cycles thus circadian metabolic cell division cycles may coordinated similarly evolutionarily conserved means preserving genome integrity
