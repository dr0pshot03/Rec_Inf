small-molecule adipor agonist type diabetes short life obesity
adiponectin secreted adipocytes binds adiponectin receptors adipor1 adipor2 exerts antidiabetic effects via activation ampk ppar-alpha pathways respectively levels adiponectin plasma reduced obesity causes insulin resistance type diabetes thus orally active small molecules bind activate adipor1 adipor2 ameliorate obesity-related diseases type diabetes report identification orally active synthetic small-molecule adipor agonists one compounds adipor agonist adiporon bound adipor1 adipor2 vitro adiporon showed similar effects adiponectin muscle liver activation ampk ppar-alpha pathways ameliorated insulin resistance glucose intolerance mice fed high-fat diet completely obliterated adipor1 adipor2 double-knockout mice moreover adiporon ameliorated diabetes genetically obese rodent model db/db mice prolonged shortened lifespan db/db mice high-fat diet thus orally active adipor agonists adiporon promising therapeutic approach treatment obesity-related diseases type diabetes
