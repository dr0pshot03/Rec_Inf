hardening annealing softening deformation nanostructured metals
observe nanostructured metal can hardened annealing softened subsequently deformed contrast typical behavior metal microstructural investigation points effect structural scale fundamental mechanisms dislocation-dislocation dislocation-interface reactions heat treatment reduces generation interaction dislocations leading increase strength reduction ductility subsequent deformation step may restore dislocation structure facilitate yielding process metal stressed consequence strength decreases ductility increases observations suggest materials nanostructured aluminum studied deformation used optimizing procedure instead annealing
