universal quantum computation exchange interaction 
various physical implementations quantum computers investigated although requirements must met make devices reality laboratory present involve capabilities well beyond state art recent solid-state approaches used quantum dots donor-atom nuclear spins electron spins architectures basic two-qubit quantum gate generated tunable exchange interaction spins heisenberg interaction whereas one-qubit gates require control local magnetic field compared heisenberg operation one-qubit operations significantly slower requiring substantially greater materials device complexity-potentially contributing detrimental increase decoherence rate introduced explicit scheme heisenberg interaction alone suffices implement exactly quantum computer circuit capability comes price factor three additional qubits factor ten additional two-qubit operations even cost ability eliminate complexity one-qubit operations accelerate progress towards solid-state implementations quantum computation
