coherent quantum state storage transfer two phase qubits via resonant cavity 
classical information processing quantum information processor requires bits qubits can independently addressed read long-term memory elements store arbitrary quantum states ability transfer quantum information coherent communication bus accessible large number qubits superconducting qubits made scalable microfabrication techniques promising candidate realization large-scale quantum information processor- although systems successfully passed tests coherent coupling four qubits- communication individual quantum states superconducting qubits via quantum bus yet realized perform experiment demonstrating ability coherently transfer quantum states two superconducting josephson phase qubits quantum bus quantum bus resonant cavity formed open-ended superconducting transmission line length mm preparing initial quantum state first qubit quantum information transferred stored nonclassical photon state resonant cavity retrieved later second qubit connected opposite end cavity beyond simple state transfer results suggest high-quality-factor superconducting cavity also function useful short-term memory element basic architecture presented can expanded offering possibility coherent interaction large number superconducting qubits
