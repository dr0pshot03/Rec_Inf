live imaging yeast golgi cisternal maturation 
debate protein trafficking performed golgi apparatus- secretory pathway secretory proteins synthesized endoplasmic reticulum enter early compartment golgi apparatus called cis cisternae undergo various modifications processing leave plasma membrane late trans cisternae cargo proteins must traverse golgi apparatus cis-totrans direction two typical models propose either vesicular transport cisternal progression maturation process vesicular transport model predicts golgi cisternae distinct stable compartments connected vesicular traffic whereas cisternal maturation model predicts cisternae transient structures form de novo mature cis trans dissipate technical progress live-cell imaging long awaited address problem show use high-speed three-dimensional confocal microscopy yeast golgi cisternae change distribution resident membrane proteins cis nature trans time proposed maturation model dynamic way
