structure bacterial quorum-sensing transcription factor complexed pheromone dna
many proteobacteria able monitor population densities release pheromones known n-acylhomoserine lactones high population densities pheromones elicit diverse responses include bioluminescence biofilm formation production antimicrobials dna exchange pathogenesis symbiosis many regulatory systems require pheromone-dependent transcription factor similar luxr protein vibrio fischeri present structure luxr-type protein trar agrobacterium tumefaciens solved angstrom complex pheromone n--oxooctanoyl-l-homoserine lactone oohl trar dna-binding site amino-terminal domain trar alpha/beta/alpha sandwich binds oohl whereas carboxy-terminal domain contains helix-turn-helix dna-binding motif trar dimer displays two-fold symmetry axis domain however two axes symmetry approximately 90degrees angle resulting pronounced overall asymmetry complex pheromone lies fully embedded within protein virtually solvent contact makes numerous hydrophobic contacts protein well four hydrogen bonds: three direct one water-mediated
