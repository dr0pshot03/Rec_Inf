nonthermal current-stimulated desorption gases carbon nanotubes 
desorption gases carbon nanotubes usually slow process limits nanotubes utility sensors memristors demonstrate flow nanotube poole-frenkel conduction threshold can stimulate adsorbates desorb without heating sensor substantially method general: alcohols aromatics amines phosphonates found desorb postulate process analogous electron-stimulated desorption internally conducted rather externally applied source electrons
