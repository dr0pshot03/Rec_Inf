extremely fast acceleration cosmic rays supernova remnant
galactic cosmic rays crs widely believed accelerated shock waves associated expansion supernova ejecta interstellar medium key issue long-standing conjecture theoretical prediction interstellar magnetic field can substantially amplified shock young supernova remnant snr magnetohydrodynamic waves generated cosmic rays report discovery brightening decay x-ray hot spots shell snr rx j1713 one-year timescale rapid variability shows x-rays produced ultrarelativistic electrons synchrotron process electron acceleration indeed take place strongly magnetized environment indicating amplification magnetic field factor x-ray variability also implies witnessed ongoing shock-acceleration electrons real time independently broadband x-ray spectro-metric measurements rx j1713 indicate electron acceleration proceeds effective bohm-diffusion regime taken together two results provide strong argument acceleration protons nuclei energies pev ev beyond young supernova remnants
