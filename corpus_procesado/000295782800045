coherent coupling superconducting flux qubit electron spin ensemble diamond 
past decade research superconducting quantum bits qubits based josephson junctions made rapid progress1 many foundational experiments performed2- superconducting qubits now considered one promising systems quantum information processing however experimentally reported coherence times likely insufficient future large-scale quantum computation natural solution problem dedicated engineered quantum memory based atomic molecular systems question whether coherent quantum coupling possible natural systems single macroscopic artificial atom attracted considerable attention9- since first demonstration macroscopic quantum coherence josephson junction circuits2 report evidence coherent strong coupling single macroscopic superconducting artificial atom flux qubit ensemble electron spins form nitrogen-vacancy colour centres diamond furthermore observed coherent exchange single quantum energy flux qubit macroscopic ensemble consisting x colour centres provides foundation future quantum memories hybrid devices coupling microwave optical systems
