increasing solar absorption photocatalysis black hydrogenated titanium dioxide nanocrystals
used photocatalyst titanium dioxide tio2 absorbs ultraviolet light several approaches including use dopants nitrogen taken narrow band gap tio2 demonstrated conceptually different approach enhancing solar absorption introducing disorder surface layers nanophase tio2 hydrogenation showed disorder-engineered tio2 nanocrystals exhibit substantial solar-driven photocatalytic activities including photo-oxidation organic molecules water production hydrogen use sacrificial reagent
