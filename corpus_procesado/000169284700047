telomere position effect human cells
yeast telomere position effect tpe results reversible silencing genes near telomeres demonstrate presence tpe human cells hela clones containing luciferase reporter adjacent newly formed telomere express times less luciferase control clones generated random integration luciferase expression restored trichostatin histone deacetylase inhibitor overexpression human telomerase reverse transcriptase complementary dna results telomere elongation additional fold decrease expression telomeric clones control clones dependence tpe telomere length provides mechanism modification gene expression throughout replicative life-span human cells
