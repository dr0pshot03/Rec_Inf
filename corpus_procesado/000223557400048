enhanced dendritic cell antigen capture via toll-like receptor-induced actin remodeling 
microbial products sensed toll-like receptors tlrs trigger program dendritic cell dc maturation enables dcs activate t cells although accepted hallmark response eventual down-regulation dc endocytic capacity show tlr ligands first acutely stimulate antigen macropinocytosis leading enhanced presentation class class major histocompatibility complex molecules simultaneously actin-rich podosomes disappear suggests coordinated redeployment actin fuel endocytosis reciprocal changes transient require p38 extracellular signal-regulated kinase activation thus dc actin cytoskeleton can rapidly mobilized response innate immune stimuli enhance antigen capture presentation
