phage-mediated intergeneric transfer toxin genes
bacteriophages generally parasitize closely related bacteria assumed phage mediated genetic exchange occurs primarily within species report staphylococcal pathogenenicity islands containing superantigen genes mobile elements transferred listeria monocytogenes high frequencies transfer within staphylococcus aureus several staphylococcal phages transduced l monocytogenes form plaques experiment modeling phage therapy bovine mastitis observed pathogenicity island transfer s aureus l monocytogenes raw milk thus phages may participate far expansive network genetic information exchange among bacteria different species originally thought important implications evolution human pathogens
