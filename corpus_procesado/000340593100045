large environments reveal statistical structure governing hippocampal representations 
rules governing formation spatial maps hippocampus determined investigated large-scale structure place field activity recording hippocampal neurons rats exploring previously unencountered meter-long track single-cell population activities well described two-parameter stochastic model individual neurons characteristic propensity forming fields randomly along track cells expressing many fields andmany exhibiting fewor none particular distribution propensities across cells number neurons fields scaled logarithmically track length wide ethological range features constrain hippocampal memory mechanisms may allow efficient encoding environments experiences vastly different extents durations reflect general principles population coding
