impact spikelets hippocampal ca1 pyramidal cell activity spatial exploration
vivo intracellular recordings hippocampal neurons reveal occurrence fast events small amplitude called spikelets fast prepotentials intracellular recordings restricted anesthetized head-fixed animals known spikelet activity contributes hippocampal spatial representations addressed question ca1 pyramidal cells using vivo whole-cell recording freely moving rats observed high incidence spikelets occurred either isolation bursts drive spiking fast prepotentials action potentials spikelets strongly contributed spiking activity driving similar % action potentials ca1 pyramidal cell firing spikelet activity comodulated function animals location environment conclude spikelets major impact hippocampal activity spatial exploration
