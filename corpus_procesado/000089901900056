nuclear receptor car mediates specific xenobiotic induction drug metabolism 
organisms encounter wide range foreign compounds-or xenobiotics-with potentially harmful consequences cytochrome p450 cyp enzymes metabolize xenobiotics thus primary defence compounds increased expression specific cyp genes response particular xenobiotics central component defence1 although induction can also increase production toxic metabolites show nuclear receptor car mediates response evoked class xenobiotics known phenobarbital-like inducers strong activation cyp2b10 gene expression phenobarbital potent tcpobop absent mice lacking car gene animals also show decreased metabolism classic cyp substrate zoxazolamine complete loss liver hypertrophic hyperplastic responses inducers cocaine causes acute hepatotoxicity wild-type mice previously exposed phenobarbital-like inducers toxicity also absent car-deficient animals thus loss car function alters sensitivity toxins increasing decreasing depending compound modulation car activity humans may significantly affect metabolism drugs xenobiotics
