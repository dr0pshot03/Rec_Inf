metatranscriptomics reveals unique microbial small rnas oceans water column
microbial gene expression environment recently assessed via pyrosequencing total rna extracted directly natural microbial assemblages several metatranscriptomic studies reported many complementary dna sequences shared significant homology known peptide sequences might represent transcripts uncharacterized proteins report large fraction cdna sequences detected microbial metatranscriptomic data sets comprised well-known small rnas srnas well new groups previously unrecognized putative srnas psrnas psrnas mapped specifically intergenic regions microbial genomes recovered similar habitats displayed characteristic conserved secondary structures frequently flanked genes indicated potential regulatory functions depth-dependent variation psrnas generally reflected known depth distributions broad taxonomic groups fine-scale differences psrnas within closely related populations indicated potential roles niche adaptation genome-specific mapping subset psrnas derived predominant planktonic species pelagibacter revealed recently discovered well potentially new regulatory elements analyses show metatranscriptomic data sets can reveal new information diversity taxonomic distribution abundance srnas naturally occurring microbial communities indicate involvement environmentally relevant processes including carbon metabolism nutrient acquisition
