genome-wide demethylation arabidopsis endosperm 
parent-of-origin-specific imprinted gene expression regulated arabidopsis thaliana endosperm cytosine demethylation maternal genome mediated dna glycosylase demeter extent methylation changes known show virtually entire endosperm genome demethylated coupled extensive local non-cg hypermethylation small interfering rna-targeted sequences mutation demeter partially restores endosperm cg methylation levels found tissues indicating cg demethylation specific maternal sequences endosperm demethylation accompanied chh hypermethylation embryo transposable elements findings demonstrate extensive reconfiguration endosperm methylation landscape likely reinforces transposon silencing embryo
