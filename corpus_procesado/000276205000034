quantum ground state single-phonon control mechanical resonator 
quantum mechanics provides highly accurate description wide variety physical systems however demonstration quantum mechanics applies equally macroscopic mechanical systems long-standing challenge hindered difficulty cooling mechanical mode quantum ground state temperatures required typically far attainable standard cryogenic methods significant effort devoted developing alternative cooling techniques ground state quantum-limited measurements must demonstrated using conventional cryogenic refrigeration show can cool mechanical mode quantum ground state using microwave-frequency mechanical oscillator-a quantum drum-coupled quantum bit used measure quantum state resonator show can controllably create single quantum excitations phonons resonator thus taking first steps complete quantum control mechanical system
