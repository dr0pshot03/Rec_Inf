large-scale sequencing human influenza reveals dynamic nature viral genome evolution
influenza viruses remarkably adept surviving human population long timescale human influenza virus continues thrive even among populations widespread access vaccines continues major cause morbidity mortality virus mutates year year making existing vaccines ineffective regular basis requiring new strains chosen new vaccine less-frequent major changes known antigenic shift create new strains human population little protective immunity thereby causing worldwide pandemics recent pandemics include spanish flu one deadly outbreaks recorded history killed million people worldwide asian flu hong kong flu motivated need better understanding influenza evolution developed flexible protocols make possible apply large-scale sequencing techniques highly variable influenza genome report results sequencing complete genomes human influenza virus encompassing total nucleotides addition increasing markedly number publicly available complete influenza virus genomes discovered several anomalies first genomes demonstrate dynamic nature influenza transmission evolution new large-scale sequencing effort promises provide comprehensive picture evolution influenza viruses pattern transmission human animal populations data project deposited without delay public archives
