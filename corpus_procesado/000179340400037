electric-field-induced capillary attraction like-charged particles liquid interfaces 
nanometre micrometre-sized charged particles aqueous interfaces typically stabilized repulsive coulomb interaction one phases forming interface nonpolar substance air oil sustain charge particles will exhibit long-ranged dipolar repulsion interface area confined mutual repulsion particles can induce ordering even crystallization however particle ordering also observed absence area confinement suggesting like-charged particles interfaces can also experience attractive interactions interface deformations known cause capillary forces attract neighbouring particles satisfying explanation origin distortions remains outstanding present quantitative measurements attractive interactions colloidal particles oil water interface show attraction can explained capillary forces arise distortion interface shape due electrostatic stresses caused particles dipolar field explanation consistent reports interfacial particle ordering far also suggests attractive interactions might controllable: tuning polarity one interfacial fluids possible adjust electrostaticstresses system hence interparticle attractions
