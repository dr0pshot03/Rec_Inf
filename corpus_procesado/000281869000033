evidence alternative glycolytic pathway rapidly proliferating cells 
proliferating cells including cancer cells require altered metabolism efficiently incorporate nutrients glucose biomass m2 isoform pyruvate kinase pkm2 promotes metabolism glucose aerobic glycolysis contributes anabolic metabolism paradoxically decreased pyruvate kinase enzyme activity accompanies expression pkm2 rapidly dividing cancer cells tissues demonstrate phosphoenolpyruvate pep substrate pyruvate kinase cells can act phosphate donor mammalian cells pep participates phosphorylation glycolytic enzyme phosphoglycerate mutase pgam1 pkm2-expressing cells used mass spectrometry show phosphate pep transferred catalytic histidine his11 human pgam1 reaction occurred physiological concentrations pep produced pyruvate absence pkm2 activity presence histidine-phosphorylated pgam1 correlated expression pkm2 cancer cell lines tumor tissues thus decreased pyruvate kinase activity pkm2-expressing cells allows pep-dependent histidine phosphorylation pgam1 may provide alternate glycolytic pathway decouples adenosine triphosphate production pep-mediated phosphotransfer allowing high rate glycolysis support anabolic metabolism observed many proliferating cells
