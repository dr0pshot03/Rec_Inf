fidelity planar cell polarity signalling
polarity drosophila wing hairs displays remarkable fidelity approximately wing epithelial cells constructs actin-rich prehair protrudes distal vertex points distally distal location orientation hairs virtually error free thus forming nearly perfect parallel array process controlled planar cell polarity signalling pathway- show interaction two tiers planar cell polarity signalling mechanism results observed high fidelity first tier mediated cadherin fat dictates global orientation transducing directional signal individual cells second tier orchestrated pass transmembrane receptor frizzled aligns cells polarity neighbours action intercellular feedback loop enabling polarity propagate cell cell show cells need respond correctly presumably subtle signal transmitted fat subsequent action frizzled feedback loop sufficient align cells cooperatively economical system therefore highly robust produces virtually error-free arrays
