exciton condensation perfect coulomb drag 
coulomb drag process whereby repulsive interactions electrons spatially separated conductors enable current flowing one conductors induce voltage drop other- second conductor part closed circuit net current will flow circuit drag current typically much smaller drive current owing heavy screening coulomb interaction however rare situations strong electronic correlations exist two conductors example double quantum well systems can support exciton condensates consist electrons one well tightly bound holes other- perfect drag therefore expected steady transport current electrons driven one quantum well accompanied equal current holes demonstrate effect taking care ensure electron-hole pairs dominate transport tunnelling charge quantum wells can readily compromise drag measurements negligible note electrical engineering perspective perfect coulomb drag analogous electrical transformer functions zero frequency
