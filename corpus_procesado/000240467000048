structure insulin receptor ectodomain reveals folded-over conformation
insulin receptor phylogenetically ancient tyrosine kinase receptor found organisms primitive cnidarians insects higher organisms essential glucose homeostasis whereas closely related insulin-like growth factor receptor igf-1r involved normal growth development insulin receptor expressed two isoforms ir-a ir-b former also functions high-affinity receptor igf-ii implicated along igf-1r malignant transformation present crystal structure angstrom resolution ir-a ectodomain dimer complexed four fabs monoclonal antibodies ref grown presence fragment insulin mimetic peptide structure reveals domain arrangement disulphide-linked ectodomain dimer showing insulin receptor adopts folded-over conformation places ligand-binding regions juxtaposition arrangement different previous models shows two l1 domains opposite sides dimer far apart allow insulin bind l1 domains simultaneously previously proposed instead structure implicates carboxy-terminal surface first fibronectin type iii domain second binding site involved high-affinity binding
