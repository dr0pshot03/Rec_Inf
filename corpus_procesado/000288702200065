cis-regulatory map drosophila genome
systematic annotation gene regulatory elements major challenge genome science direct mapping chromatin modification marks transcriptional factor binding sites genome-wide successfully identified specific subtypes regulatory elements drosophila several pioneering studies provided genome-wide identification polycomb response elements chromatin states transcription factor binding sites- rna polymerase ii regulation insulator elements however comprehensive annotation regulatory genome remains significant challenge describe results modencode cis-regulatory annotation project produced map drosophila melanogaster regulatory genome basis chromatin immunoprecipitation data sets eight chromatin features five histone deacetylases thirty-eight site-specific transcription factors different stages development using data inferred candidate regulatory elements validated subset predictions promoters enhancers insulators vivo identified also nearly genomic regions dense transcription factor binding associated chromatin activity accessibility discovered hundreds new transcription factor co-binding relationships defined transcription factor network potential regulatory relationships
