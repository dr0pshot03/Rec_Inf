thyrotrophin pars tuberalis triggers photoperiodic response 
molecular mechanisms regulating animal seasonal breeding response changing photoperiod well understood rapid induction gene expression thyroid hormone activating enzyme type deiodinase dio2 mediobasal hypothalamus mbh japanese quail coturnix japonica earliest event yet recorded photoperiodic signal transduction pathway show cascades gene expression quail mbh associated initiation photoinduced secretion luteinizing hormone identified two waves gene expression first initiated h dawn first long day included increased thyrotrophin tsh beta subunit expression pars tuberalis; second occurred approximately h later included increased expression dio2 intracerebroventricular icv administration tsh short day quail stimulated gonadal growth expression dio2 shown mediated tsh receptor cyclic amp camp signalling pathway increased tsh pars tuberalis therefore seems trigger long day photoinduced seasonal breeding
