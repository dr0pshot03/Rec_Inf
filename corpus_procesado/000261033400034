observation pulsed gamma-rays gev crab pulsar magic
one fundamental question pulsars concerns mechanism pulsed electromagnetic emission measuring high end region pulsars spectrum shed light question developing new electronic trigger lowered threshold major atmospheric gamma-ray imaging cherenkov magic telescope giga-electron volts configuration detected pulsed gamma-rays crab pulsar greater giga-electron volts revealing relatively high cutoff energy phase averaged spectrum indicates emission occurs far magnetosphere hence excluding polar cap scenario possible explanation measurement high cutoff energy also challenges slot gap scenario
