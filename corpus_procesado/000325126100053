specific chemical reactivities spatially separated aminophenol conformers cold ca+ ions
many molecules exhibit multiple rotational isomers conformers interconvert thermally difficult isolate consequently precise characterization role chemical reactions proven challenging probed reactivity specific conformers using experimental technique based spatial separation molecular beam electrostatic deflection separated conformers react target coulomb-crystallized ions trap reaction ca+ aminophenol find twofold larger rate constant cis compared trans conformer differentiated o-h bond orientation result explained conformer-specific differences long-range ion-molecule interaction potentials approach demonstrates possibility controlling reactivity selection conformational states
