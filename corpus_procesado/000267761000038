direct observation correlations individual photon emission events microcavity laser 
lasers recognized coherent light emission onset reflected change photon statistics1 many years attempts made directly measure correlations individual photon emission events semiconductor lasers23 previously temporal decay correlations lasing threshold considerably faster measured time resolution provided hanbury brown/twiss measurement set-up4 used demonstrate measurement technique using streak camera overcomes limitation provides record arrival times individual photons allows us investigate dynamical evolution correlations individual photon emission events apply studies micropillar lasers5 semiconductor quantum dots236- active material operating regime cavity quantum electrodynamics9 laser resonators low cavity quality factor q smooth transition photon bunching uncorrelated emission increasing pumping observed; high-q resonators see non-monotonic dependence around threshold quantum light emission can occur identify regimes dynamical anti-bunching photons agreement predictions microscopic theory includes semiconductor-specific effects
