attractive photons quantum nonlinear medium 
fundamental properties light derive constituent particles-massless quanta photons interact one another however long known realization coherent interactions individual photons akin associated conventional massive particles enable wide variety novel scientific engineering applications demonstrate quantum nonlinear medium inside individual photons travel massive particles strong mutual attraction propagation photon pairs dominated two-photon bound state- achieve dispersive coupling light strongly interacting atoms highly excited rydberg states measure dynamical evolution two-photon wave-function using time-resolved quantum state tomography demonstrate conditional phase shift exceeding one radian resulting polarization-entangled photon pairs particular applications technique include all-optical switching deterministic photonic quantum logic generation strongly correlated states light
