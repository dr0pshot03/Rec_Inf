attractive photons quantum nonlinear medium 
fundamental properties light derive constituent particles-massless quanta photons interact one another1 however long known realization coherent interactions individual photons akin associated conventional massive particles enable wide variety novel scientific engineering applications23 demonstrate quantum nonlinear medium inside individual photons travel massive particles strong mutual attraction propagation photon pairs dominated two-photon bound state4- achieve dispersive coupling light strongly interacting atoms highly excited rydberg states measure dynamical evolution two-photon wave-function using time-resolved quantum state tomography demonstrate conditional phase shift8 exceeding one radian resulting polarization-entangled photon pairs particular applications technique include all-optical switching deterministic photonic quantum logic generation strongly correlated states light9
