isolated single-cycle attosecond pulses
generated single-cycle isolated attosecond pulses around similar electron volts using phase-stabilized femtosecond driving pulses modulated polarization state using complete temporal characterization technique demonstrated compression generated pulses low attoseconds corresponding less optical cycles numerical simulations generation process show carrier-envelope phase attosecond pulses stable availability single-cycle isolated attosecond pulses opens way new regime ultrafast physics strong-field electron dynamics atoms molecules driven electric field attosecond pulses rather intensity profile
