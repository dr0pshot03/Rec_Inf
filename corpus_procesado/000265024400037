genome-wide analysis vivo translation nucleotide resolution using ribosome profiling 
techniques systematically monitoring protein translation lagged far behind methods measuring messenger rna mrna levels present ribosome-profiling strategy based deep sequencing ribosome-protected mrna fragments enables genome-wide investigation translation subcodon resolution used technique monitor translation budding yeast rich starvation conditions studies defined protein sequences translated found extensive translational control determining absolute protein abundance responding environmental stress also observed distinct phases translation involve large decrease ribosome density going early late peptide elongation well widespread regulated initiation non-adenine-uracil-guanine aug codons ribosome profiling readily adaptable organisms making high-precision investigation protein translation experimentally accessible
