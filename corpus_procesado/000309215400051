evidence abundant purifying selection humans recently acquired regulatory functions 
although % human genome conserved across mammals substantially larger portion biochemically active raising question whether additional elements evolve neutrally confer lineage-specific fitness advantage address question integrate human variation information genomes project activity data encode project broad range transcribed regulatory nonconserved elements show decreased human diversity suggesting lineage-specific purifying selection conversely conserved elements lacking activity show increased human diversity suggesting recently became nonfunctional regulatory elements human constraint nonconserved regions found near color vision nerve-growth genes consistent purifying selection recently evolved functions results suggest continued turnover regulatory regions least additional % human genome subject lineage-specific constraint
