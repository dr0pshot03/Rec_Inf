multiple spectral inputs improve motion discrimination drosophila visual system 
color motion information thought channeled separate neural pathways remains unclear whether pathways interact improve motion perception insects drosophila long believed motion information fed exclusively one spectral class photoreceptor so-called r1 r6 cells whereas r7 r8 photoreceptors exist multiple spectral classes subserve color vision report r7 r8 also contribute motion pathway using electrophysiological optical behavioral assays found r7/r8 information converge shape motion pathway output explaining flies broadly tuned optomotor behavior composite responses results demonstrate inputs photoreceptors different spectral sensitivities improve motion discrimination increasing robustness perception
