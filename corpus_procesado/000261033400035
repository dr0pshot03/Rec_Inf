ab initio determination light hadron masses 
% mass visible universe made protons neutrons particles much heavier quark gluon constituents standard model particle physics explain difference present full ab initio calculation masses protons neutrons light hadrons using lattice quantum chromodynamics pion masses mega electron volts used extrapolate physical point lattice sizes approximately four times inverse pion mass three lattice spacings used continuum extrapolation results completely agree experimental observations represent quantitative confirmation aspect standard model fully controlled uncertainties
