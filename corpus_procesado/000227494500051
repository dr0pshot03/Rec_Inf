agonist/endogenous peptide-mhc heterodimers drive t cell activation sensitivity
alphabeta t lymphocytes able detect even single peptide major histocompatibility complex mhc surface antigen-presenting cell despite clear evidence least cd4+ t cells monomeric ligands stimulatory effort understand remarkable sensitivity achieved constructed soluble peptide mhc heterodimers one peptide agonist one large number endogenous peptide mhcs displayed presenting cells found specific combinations heterodimers can stimulate specific t cells cd4-dependent manner activation severely impaired cd4-binding site agonist ligand ablated mutation endogenous ligand effect data correlate well analyses lipid bilayers cells presenting ligands indicate basic unit helper t cell activation heterodimer agonist peptide endogenous peptide mhc complexes stabilized cd4
