enhanced supercurrent density polycrystalline yba2cu3o7-delta k calcium doping grain boundaries 
discovery high-temperature superconductivity seemed vision superconducting power cables operating boiling point liquid nitrogen k close realization soon found critical current density jc supercurrents can pass polycrystalline materials without destroying superconductivity remarkably small many materials jc suppressed grain boundaries- phenomena interface charging bending electronic band structure- partial replacement `doping yttrium yba2cu3o7-delta calcium used increase grain-boundary jc values substantially temperatures much lower k ref show preferentially overdoping grain boundaries relative grains yields values jc k far exceed previously published values results indicate grain-boundary doping viable approach producing practical cost-effective superconducting power cable operating liquid-nitrogen temperatures
