constitutive law dense granular flows 
continuum description granular flows considerable help predicting natural geophysical hazards designing industrial processes however constitutive equations dry granular flows govern material moves shear still matter debate- one difficulty grains can behave like solid sand pile liquid poured silo gas strongly agitated two extreme regimes constitutive equations proposed based kinetic theory collisional rapid flows soil mechanics slow plastic flows however intermediate dense regime granular material flows like liquid still lacks unified view motivated many studies past decade main characteristics granular liquids are: yield criterion critical shear stress flow possible complex dependence shear rate flowing sense granular matter shares similarities classical visco-plastic fluids bingham fluids propose new constitutive relation dense granular flows inspired analogy recent numerical experimental work- test three-dimensional 3d model experiments granular flows pile rough sidewalls complex 3d flow pattern develops show without fitting parameter model gives quantitative predictions flow shape velocity profiles results support idea simple visco-plastic approach can quantitatively capture granular flow properties serve basic tool modelling complex flows geophysical industrial applications
