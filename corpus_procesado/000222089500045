protein kinase g pathogenic mycobacteria promotes survival within macrophages 
pathogenic mycobacteria resist lysosomal delivery uptake macrophages allowing survive intracellularly found eukaryotic-like serine/threonine protein kinase g pathogenic mycobacteria secreted within macrophage phagosomes inhibiting phagosome-lysosome fusion mediating intracellular survival mycobacteria inactivation protein kinase g gene disruption chemical inhibition resulted lysosomal localization mycobacterial cell death infected macrophages besides identifying target control mycobacterial infections findings suggest pathogenic mycobacteria evolved eukaryotic-like signal transduction mechanisms capable modulating host cell trafficking pathways
