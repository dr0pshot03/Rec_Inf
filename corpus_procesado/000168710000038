spherical episodic ejection material young star
exact processes interstellar matter condenses form young stars great interest part bear formation planets like material fails become part star theoretical models suggest ejection gas early phases stellar evolution key mechanism removing excess angular momentum thereby allowing material drift inwards towards star accretion disk ejections also limit mass can accumulated stellar core date ejections observed bipolar highly collimated agreement theory report observations high angular resolution proper motions arc water-vapour masers near young massive star cepheus rnd arc masers can fitted circle accuracy one part thousand structure expanding sphere will always produce circle projection observations strongly suggest perfectly spherical ejection material star took place years earlier spherical symmetry ejecta episodic nature surprising light present theories
