planet heating prevents inward migration planetary cores
planetary systems born disks gas dust rocky fragments surround newly formed stars solid content assembles ever-larger rocky fragments eventually become planetary embryos continue growth accreting leftover material disk concurrently tidal effects disk cause radial drift embryo orbits process known migration- fast inward migration predicted theory embryos smaller three five earth masses- inward migration embryos can rarely become giant planets located earths distance sun beyond contrast observations report asymmetries temperature rise associated accreting infalling material produce force gives rise effect call heating torque counteracts inward migration provides channel formation giant planets also explains strong planet-metallicity correlation found incidence giant planets heavy-element abundance host stars
