protrudin induces neurite formation directional membrane trafficking
guanosine triphosphatases rab family key regulators membrane trafficking rab11 playing specific role membrane recycling identified mammalian protein protrudin promoted neurite formation interaction guanosine diphosphate gdp bound form rab11 phosphorylation protrudin extracellular signal regulated kinase erk response nerve growth factor promoted protrudin association rab11-gdp down-regulation protrudin rna interference induced membrane extension directions inhibited neurite formation thus protrudin regulates rab11-dependent membrane recycling promote directional membrane trafficking required neurite formation
