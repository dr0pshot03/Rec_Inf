room-temperature enantioselective c-h iodination via kinetic resolution
asymmetric carbon-hydrogen c-h activation reactions often rely desymmetrization prochiral c-h bonds achiral molecule using chiral catalyst report kinetic resolution via palladium-catalyzed enantioselective c-h iodination one enantiomers racemic benzylic amine substrates undergoes faster aryl c-h insertion chiral catalysts resulting enantioenriched c-h functionalization products accessible desymmetrization prochiral c-h bonds exceedingly high relative rate ratio kfast/kslow coupled subsequent iodination remaining enantiomerically enriched starting material using chiral ligand opposite configuration enables conversion substrate enantiomers enantiomerically pure iodinated products
