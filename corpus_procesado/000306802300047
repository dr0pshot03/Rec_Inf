dsarm/sarm1 required activation injury-induced axon death pathway
axonal synaptic degeneration hallmark peripheral neuropathy brain injury neurodegenerative disease axonal degeneration proposed mediated active autodestruction program akin apoptotic cell death however loss-of-function mutations capable potently blocking axon self-destruction described show loss drosophila toll receptor adaptor dsarm sterile alpha/armadillo/toll-interleukin receptor homology domain protein cell-autonomously suppresses wallerian degeneration weeks axotomy severed mouse sarm1 null axons exhibit remarkable long-term survival vivo vitro indicating sarm1 prodegenerative signaling conserved mammals results provide direct evidence axons actively promote destruction injury identify dsarm/sarm1 member ancient axon death signaling pathway
