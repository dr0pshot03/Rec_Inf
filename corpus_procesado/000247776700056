sea anemone genome reveals ancestral eumetazoan gene repertoire genomic organization 
sea anemones seemingly primitive animals along corals jellyfish hydras constitute oldest eumetazoan phylum cnidaria report comparative analysis draft genome emerging cnidarian model starlet sea anemone nematostella vectensis sea anemone genome complex gene repertoire exon-intron structure large-scale gene linkage similar vertebrates flies nematodes implying genome eumetazoan ancestor similarly complex nearly one-fifth inferred genes ancestor eumetazoan novelties enriched animal functions like cell signaling adhesion synaptic transmission analysis diverse pathways suggests gene "inventions" along lineage leading animals likely already well integrated preexisting eukaryotic genes eumetazoan progenitor
