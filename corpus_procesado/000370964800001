bmp gradients: paradigm morphogen-mediated developmental patterning
bone morphogenetic proteins bmps act dose-dependent fashion regulate cell fate choices myriad developmental contexts early vertebrate invertebrate embryos bmps antagonists establish epidermal versus central nervous system domains highly conserved system bmp antagonists mediate neural-inductive activities proposed hans spemann hilde mangold nearly century ago bmps distributed gradients subsequently function morphogens subdivide three germ layers distinct territories act organize body axes regulate growth maintain stem cell niches signal inductively across germ layers review summarize variety mechanisms contribute generating reliable developmental responses bmp gradients morphogen systems
