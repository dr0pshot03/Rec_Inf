restricting dislocation movement transition metal carbides phase stability tuning 
mechanism enhance hardness multilayer coatings proposed using technologically important hard transition metal carbides prototypes although principle transferable also systems demonstrate first-principles calculations suitable alloying energy difference several competing structures transition meta[ carbides small tunable creates multiphase/polytypic compounds random controllable layer stacking sequence systems propagation dislocations can strongly suppressed large number interfaces structures different glide systems accordingly allowing possibility greatly enhanced hardness modern thin-film technologies therefore possible deposit materials will express multilayer characteristics minor changes chemical constitution material contrast conventional superlattices
