species-specific responses late quaternary megafauna climate humans
despite decades research roles climate humans driving dramatic extinctions large-bodied mammals late quaternary period remain contentious use ancient dna species distribution models human fossil record elucidate climate humans shaped demographic history woolly rhinoceros woolly mammoth wild horse reindeer bison musk ox show climate major driver population change past years however species responds differently effects climatic shifts habitat redistribution human encroachment although climate change alone can explain extinction species eurasian musk ox woolly rhinoceros combination climatic anthropogenic effects appears responsible extinction others including eurasian steppe bison wild horse find genetic signature distinctive range dynamics distinguishing extinct surviving species emphasizing challenges associated predicting future responses extant mammals climate human-mediated habitat change
