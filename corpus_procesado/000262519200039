intersubunit coordination homomeric ring atpase
homomeric ring atpases perform many vital varied tasks cell ranging chromosome segregation protein degradation report direct observation intersubunit coordination step size ring atpase double stranded dna packaging motor bacteriophage phi using high resolution optical tweezers find packaging occurs increments base pairs bp statistical analysis preceding dwell times reveals multiple atps bind dwell application high force reveals bp increments composed four bp steps results indicate hydrolysis cycles individual subunits highly coordinated means mechanism novel ring atpases furthermore step size non integer number base pairs demands new models motor dna interactions
