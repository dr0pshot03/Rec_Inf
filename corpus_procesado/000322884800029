sequence-controlled polymers 
sequence-controlled polymers macromolecules monomer units different chemical nature arranged ordered fashion prominent examples biological studied used primarily molecular biologists biochemists however recent progress protein-and dna-based nanotechnologies shown relevance sequence-controlled polymers nonbiological applications including data storage nanoelectronics catalysis addition synthetic polymer chemistry provided interesting routes preparing nonnatural sequence-controlled polymers although synthetic macromolecules yet compare functional scope natural counterparts open opportunities controlling structure self-assembly macroscopic properties polymer materials
