postmating sexual selection favors males sire offspring low fitness 
despite costs mating females taxa mate multiple males polyandrous females hypothesized gain genetic benefits offspring assumes paternity bias favoring male genotypes enhance offspring viability determined net male genetic effects female offspring fitness seed beetle tested whether fertilization success biased favor high-quality male genotypes double mating experiments contrary expectations high-quality male genotypes consistently lower postmating fertilization success two independent assays results imply sexually antagonistic adaptations major unappreciated influence male postmating fertilization success genetic variation renders indirect genetic benefits unlikely driver evolution polyandry
