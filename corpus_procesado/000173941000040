chiral recognition dimerization adsorbed cysteine observed scanning tunnelling microscopy 
stereochemistry plays central role controlling molecular recognition interaction: chemical biological properties molecules depend nature constituent atoms also atoms positioned space chiral specificity consequently fundamental chemical biology pharmacology12 accordingly widely studied advances scanning probe microscopies now make possible probe chiral phenomena surfaces molecular level methods used determine chirality adsorbed molecules3- provide direct evidence chiral discrimination molecular interactions6 spontaneous resolution adsorbates extended enantiomerically pure overlayers37- report scanning tunnelling microscopy studies cysteine adsorbed gold surface show molecular pairs formed racemic mixture naturally occurring amino acid exclusively homochiral binding gold surface associated local surface restructuring density-functional theory10 calculations indicate chiral specificity dimer formation process driven optimization three bonds cysteine molecule findings thus provide clear molecular-level illustration well known three-point contact model1112 chiral recognition simple bimolecular system
