morphogenetic cell movements: diversity modular mechanical properties 
animal tissue organ development requires orchestration cell movements including interconnected cell groups termed collective cell movements movements incredibly diverse recent work suggests two core cellular properties cell cell adhesion contractility can largely determine geometry packing sorting rearrangement epithelial cell layers two additional force generating properties ability generate cell protrusions cell adhesion extracellular matrix contribute active motility mechanical properties can regulated independently cells suggesting can employed combinatorial manner small number properties used combination principle generate diverse array cell shapes arrangements thus orchestrate varied morphogenetic events observed metazoan organ development
