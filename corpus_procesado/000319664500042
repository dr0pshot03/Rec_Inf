functional extinction birds drives rapid evolutionary changes seed size 
local extinctions cascading effects ecosystem functions yet little known potential rapid evolutionary change species human-modified scenarios show functional extinction large-gape seed dispersers brazilian atlantic forest associated consistent reduction seed size keystone palm species among palm populations areas deprived large avian frugivores several decades present smaller seeds nondefaunated forests negative consequences palm regeneration coalescence phenotypic selection models indicate seed size reduction likely occurred within past years associated human-driven fragmentation fast-paced defaunation large vertebrates likely causing unprecedented changes evolutionary trajectories community composition tropical forests
