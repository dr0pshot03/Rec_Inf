invasive plants scale-dependent effects diversity altering species-area relationships 
although invasive plant species often reduce diversity rarely cause plant extinctions surveyed paired invaded uninvaded plant communities three biomes reconcile discrepancy diversity loss invaders showing invaded communities lower local richness steeper species accumulation area uninvaded communities leading proportionately fewer species loss broader spatial scales show invaders drive scale-dependent biodiversity loss strong neutral sampling effects number individuals community also show nonneutral species extirpations due proportionately larger effect invaders common species suggesting rare species buffered extinction study provides synthetic perspective threat invasions biodiversity loss across spatial scales
