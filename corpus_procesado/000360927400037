arithmetic local circuitry underlying dopamine prediction errors
dopamine neurons thought facilitate learning comparing actual expected reward despite two decades investigation little known comparison made determine dopamine neurons calculate prediction error combined optogenetic manipulations extracellular recordings ventral tegmental area mice engaged classical conditioning demonstrate manipulating temporal expectation reward dopamine neurons perform subtraction computation ideal reinforcement learning rarely observed brain furthermore selectively exciting inhibiting neighbouring gaba c-aminobutyric acid neurons ventral tegmental area reveals neurons source subtraction: inhibit dopamine neurons reward expected causally contributing prediction-error calculations finally bilaterally stimulating ventral tegmental area gaba neurons dramatically reduces anticipatory licking conditioned odours consistent important role neurons reinforcement learning together results uncover arithmetic local circuitry underlying dopamine prediction errors
