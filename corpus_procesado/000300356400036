systematic survey loss-of-function variants human protein-coding genes
genome-sequencing studies indicate humans carry many genetic variants predicted cause loss function lof protein-coding genes suggesting unexpected redundancy human genome apply stringent filters putative lof variants obtained human genomes determine true prevalence properties estimate human genomes typically contain similar genuine lof variants similar genes completely inactivated identify rare likely deleterious lof alleles including known predicted severe disease-causing variants well common lof variants nonessential genes describe functional evolutionary differences lof-tolerant recessive disease genes method using differences prioritize candidate genes found clinical sequencing studies
