transcription regulation animal diversity
whole-genome sequence assemblies now available seven different animals including nematode worms mice humans comparative genome analyses reveal surprising constancy genetic content: vertebrate genomes twice number genes invertebrate genomes increase primarily due duplication existing genes rather invention new ones evolutionary diversity arisen emerging evidence suggests organismal complexity arises progressively elaborate regulation gene expression
