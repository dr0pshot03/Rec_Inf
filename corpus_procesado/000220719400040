real-time quantum feedback control atomic spin-squeezing retracted article see vol pg 
real-time feedback performed quantum nondemolition measurement atomic spin-angular momentum allowed us influence quantum statistics measurement outcome showed possible harness measurement backaction form actuation quantum control thus describe valuable tool quantum information science feedback-mediated procedure generates spin-squeezing reduction quantum uncertainty resulting atomic entanglement conditioned measurement outcome
