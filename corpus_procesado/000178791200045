postsynaptic signaling plasticity mechanisms 
excitatory synapses brain specific receptors postsynaptic membrane lie ready respond release neurotransmitter glutamate presynaptic terminal upon stimulation glutamate receptors activate multiple biochemical pathways transduce signals postsynaptic neuron different kinds synaptic activity elicit different patterns postsynaptic signals lead short long-lasting strengthening weakening synaptic transmission complex molecular mechanisms underlie postsynaptic signaling plasticity beginning emerge
