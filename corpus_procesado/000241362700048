high-throughput synthesis catalytic properties molecular sieve member rings
crystalline molecular sieves large pores high adsorption capacities many potential applications- materials zeolites particular interest owing stability wide range experimental conditions aluminophosphate large circular channels containing oxygen atoms -ring channels synthesized search large-pore zeolites materials synthesized now contain ring channels synthesis zeolites larger ring structures believed hindered low si-o-si bond angles available silicogaloaluminate ecr- unidirectional ring channels recently reported exhibited low micropore volume thus rendering material less attractive catalytic applications report structure catalytic activity silicogermanate zeolite itq- material exhibits straight large pore channels circular openings rings along c axis interconnected bidirectional system ring channels yielding structure large micropore volume conditions synthesis easily accessible typical identified using high-throughput techniques
