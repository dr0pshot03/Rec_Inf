pml regulates apoptosis endoplasmic reticulum modulating calcium release
promyelocytic leukemia pml tumor suppressor pleiotropic modulator apoptosis however molecular basis diverse proapoptotic role currently unknown show extranuclear pml specifically enriched endoplasmic reticulum er mitochondria-associated membranes signaling domains involved er-to-mitochondria calcium ion ca+ transport induction apoptosis found pml complexes large molecular size inositol -trisphosphate receptor ipr protein kinase akt protein phosphatase 2a pp2a pml essential akt pp2a-dependent modulation ipr phosphorylation turn ipr-mediated ca+ release er findings provide mechanistic explanation pleiotropic role pml apoptosis identify pharmacological target modulation ca+ signals
