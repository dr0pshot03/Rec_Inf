pml regulates apoptosis endoplasmic reticulum modulating calcium release 
promyelocytic leukemia pml tumor suppressor pleiotropic modulator apoptosis however molecular basis diverse proapoptotic role currently unknown show extranuclear pml specifically enriched endoplasmic reticulum er mitochondria-associated membranes signaling domains involved er-to-mitochondria calcium ion ca2+ transport induction apoptosis found pml complexes large molecular size inositol -trisphosphate receptor ip3r protein kinase akt protein phosphatase 2a pp2a pml essential akt pp2a-dependent modulation ip3r phosphorylation turn ip3r-mediated ca2+ release er findings provide mechanistic explanation pleiotropic role pml apoptosis identify pharmacological target modulation ca2+ signals
