diversity ageing across tree life 
evolution drives driven demography genotype moulds phenotypes age patterns mortality fertility environment; two patterns turn determine genotypes fitness environment hence understand evolution ageing age patterns mortality reproduction need compared species across tree life however studies done limited range taxa contrast standardized patterns age mammals vertebrates invertebrates vascular plants green alga although predicted evolution inevitably lead increasing mortality declining fertility age maturity great variation among species including increasing constant decreasing humped bowed trajectories long-and short-lived species diversity challenges theoreticians develop broader perspectives evolution ageing empiricists study demography species
