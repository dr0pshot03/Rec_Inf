efficient polymer molecular sieve membrane gas separations
microporous polymers extreme rigidity required gas-separation membranes combine high permeability selectivity report shape-persistent ladder polymer consisting benzene rings fused together inflexible bridged bicyclic units polymers contorted shape ensures microporosity-with internal surface area greater square meters per gram-and solubility readily cast solution robust films films demonstrate exceptional performance molecular sieves high gas permeabilities good selectivities smaller gas molecules hydrogen oxygen larger molecules nitrogen methane hence polymer excellent potential making membranes suitable large-scale gas separations commercial environmental relevance
