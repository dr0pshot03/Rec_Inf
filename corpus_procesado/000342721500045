sidewinding minimal slip: snake robot ascent sandy slopes 
limbless organisms snakes can navigate nearly terrain particular desert-dwelling sidewinder rattlesnakes crotalus cerastes operate effectively inclined granular media sand dunes induce failure field-tested limbless robots slipping pitching laboratory experiments reveal granular incline angle increases sidewinder rattlesnakes increase length body contact sand implementing strategy physical robot model snake enables device ascend sandy slopes close angle maximum slope stability plate drag experiments demonstrate granular yield stresses decrease increasing incline angle together three approaches demonstrate sidewinding contact-length control mitigates failure granular media
