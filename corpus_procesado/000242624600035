brown dwarf mass donor accreting binary 
long-standing unverified prediction binary star evolution theory existence population white dwarfs accreting substellar donor stars systems common difficulty finding combined challenge detecting donor light accretion means donor star date measured mass hydrogen burning limit applied technique allowed us reliably measure mass unseen donor star eclipsing systems able identify brown dwarf donor star mass +/ solar mass relatively high mass donor star orbital period suggests current evolutionary models may underestimate radii brown dwarfs
