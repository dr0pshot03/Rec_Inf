immunogenicity somatic mutations human gastrointestinal cancers 
unknown whether human immune system frequently mounts t cell response mutations expressed common epithelial cancers using next-generation sequencing approach combined high-throughput immunologic screening demonstrated tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes tils patients metastatic gastrointestinal cancers contained cd4+ and/or cd8+ t cells recognized one three neo-epitopes derived somatic mutations expressed patients tumor immunogenic epitopes shared patients however identified one patient human leukocyte antigen-c*:-restricted t cell receptor cd8+ tils targeted krasg12d hotspot driver mutation found many human cancers thus high frequency patients common gastrointestinal cancers harbor immunogenic mutations can potentially exploited development highly personalized immunotherapies
