effect ancient population bottlenecks human phenotypic variation
origin patterns dispersal anatomically modern humans focus considerable debate- global genetic analyses argued one single origin placed somewhere africa- scenario implies rapid expansion series bottlenecks small amplitude led observed smooth loss genetic diversity increasing distance africa analyses cranial data hand given mixed results- argued support multiple origins modern humans using large data set skull measurements analytical framework equivalent used genetic data show loss genetic diversity mirrored loss phenotypic variability find evidence african origin placed somewhere central/southern part continent harbours highest intra-population diversity phenotypic measurements failed find evidence second origin confirm results large genetic data set distance africa accounts average % heritable variation craniometric measurements remarkably strong effect phenotypic measurements known selection
