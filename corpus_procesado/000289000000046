c-terminal domain rna polymerase ii modified site-specific methylation 
carboxy-terminal domain ctd rna polymerase ii rnapii mammals undergoes extensive posttranslational modification essential transcriptional initiation elongation show ctd rnapii methylated single arginine r1810 coactivator-associated arginine methyltransferase carm1 although methylation r1810 present hyperphosphorylated form rnapii vivo ser2 ser5 phosphorylation inhibits carm1 activity toward site vitro suggesting methylation occurs transcription initiation mutation r1810 results misexpression variety small nuclear rnas small nucleolar rnas effect also observed carm1-/- mouse embryo fibroblasts results demonstrate ctd methylation facilitates expression select rnas perhaps serving discriminate rnapii-associated machinery recruited distinct gene types
