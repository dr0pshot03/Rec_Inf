darwinian evolution prions cell culture 
prions infectious proteins consisting mainly prpsc beta sheet-rich conformer normal host protein prpc occur different strains strain identity thought encoded prpsc conformation found biologically cloned prion populations gradually became heterogeneous accumulating mutants selective pressures resulted emergence different mutants major constituents evolving population thus transferred brain cultured cells cell-adapted prions outcompeted brain-adapted counterparts opposite occurred prions returned cells brain similarly inhibitor swainsonine selected resistant substrain whereas absence susceptible substrain outgrew resistant counterpart prions albeit devoid nucleic acid genome thus subject mutation selective amplification
