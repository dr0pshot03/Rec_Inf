observation berrys phase solid-state qubit
quantum information science phase wave function plays important role encoding information although experiments field rely dynamic effects manipulate information alternative approach use geometric phase argued potential fault tolerance demonstrated controlled accumulation geometric phase berrys phase superconducting qubit manipulated qubit geometrically means microwave radiation observed accumulated phase interference experiment found excellent agreement berrys predictions also observed geometry dependent contribution dephasing
