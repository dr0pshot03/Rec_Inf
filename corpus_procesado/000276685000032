dilithioplumbole: lead-bearing aromatic cyclopentadienyl analog 
although concept aromaticity long played important role carbon chemistry unclear applicable stabilizing framework heaviest elements report synthesis dilithiotetraphenylplumbole reduction hexaphenylplumbole x-ray crystallography revealed planar structure alternation carbon-carbon bond lengths five-membered ring core nuclear magnetic resonance spectra relativistic theoretical calculations show considerable aromatic character molecule thus extending aromaticity carbons heaviest congener
