adenylate cyclases trypanosoma brucei inhibit innate immune response host 
parasite trypanosoma brucei possesses large family transmembrane receptor-like adenylate cyclases activation enzymes requires dimerization catalytic domain typically occurs stress using dominant-negative strategy found reducing adenylate cyclase activity % allowed trypanosome growth reduced parasites ability control early innate immune defense host specifically activation trypanosome adenylate cyclase resulting parasite phagocytosis liver myeloid cells inhibited synthesis trypanosome-controlling cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha activation protein kinase cells thus adenylate cyclase activity lyzed trypanosomes favors early host colonization live parasites role adenylate cyclases host-parasite interface explain expansion polymorphism gene family
