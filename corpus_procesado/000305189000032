big bang tomography new route atomic-resolution electron tomography 
now possible image atomic resolution using classical electron tomographic methods1 except target perfectly crystalline nano-object imaged along zone axes2 main reasons mechanical tilting electron microscope sub-angstrom precision large angular range difficult many real-life objects dielectric layers microelectronic devices impose geometrical constraints many radiation-sensitive objects proteins limit total electron dose hence need new tomographic scheme able deduce three-dimensional information one projections present electron tomographic method can used determine one viewing direction sub-angstrom precision position individual atoms plane observation vertical position concept based fact experimentally reconstructed exit wave34 consists superposition spherical waves scattered individual atoms object furthermore phase fourier component spherical wave increases distance propagation known phase speed assume atom point-like object relationship phase phase speed fourier component linear distance atom plane observation can therefore determined linear fitting picture similarities big bang cosmology universe expands point-like origin distance galaxy origin linearly proportional speed moves away origin hubble expansion proof concept method demonstrated experimentally graphene two-layer structure will work optimally similar layered materials boron nitride molybdenum disulphide
