clonogenic neoblasts pluripotent adult stem cells underlie planarian regeneration
pluripotent cells embryo can generate cell types lineage-restricted cells generally thought replenish adult tissues planarians flatworms regenerate tiny body fragments process requiring population proliferating cells neoblasts whether regeneration accomplished pluripotent cells collective activity multiple lineage-restricted cell types unknown used ionizing radiation single-cell transplantation identify neoblasts can form large descendant-cell colonies vivo clonogenic neoblasts cneoblasts produce cells differentiate neuronal intestinal known postmitotic cell types distributed throughout body single transplanted cneoblasts restored regeneration lethally irradiated hosts conclude broadly distributed adult pluripotent stem cells underlie remarkable regenerative abilities planarians
