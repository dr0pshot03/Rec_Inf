random tiling topological defects two-dimensional molecular network 
molecular network exhibits critical correlations spatial order characteristic random entropically stabilized rhombus tiling described specifically report random tiling formed two dimensional molecular network p-terphenyl- -tetracarboxylic acid adsorbed graphite network stabilized hexagonal junctions three four five six molecules may mapped onto rhombus tiling ordered array vertices embedded within nonperiodic framework spatial fluctuations local order characteristic entropically stabilized phase identified topological defect can propagate network giving rise local reordering molecular tiles thus transitions quasi degenerate local minima complex energy landscape draw parallels molecular tiling dynamically arrested systems glasses
