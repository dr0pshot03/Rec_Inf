active starvation responses mediate antibiotic tolerance biofilms nutrient-limited bacteria
bacteria become highly tolerant antibiotics nutrients limited inactivity antibiotic targets caused starvation-induced growth arrest thought key mechanism producing tolerance show antibiotic tolerance nutrient-limited biofilm pseudomonas aeruginosa mediated active responses starvation rather passive effects growth arrest protective mechanism controlled starvation-signaling stringent response sr experiments link sr-mediated tolerance reduced levels oxidant stress bacterial cells furthermore inactivating protective mechanism sensitized biofilms several orders magnitude four different classes antibiotics markedly enhanced efficacy antibiotic treatment experimental infections
