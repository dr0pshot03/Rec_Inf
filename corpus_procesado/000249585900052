microrna inhibition translation initiation vitro targeting cap-binding complex elf4f 
micrornas mirnas play important role gene regulatory networks animals yet mechanistic details function translation inhibition messenger rna mrna destabilization remain controversial directly examine earliest events process developed vitro translation system using mouse krebs ascites cell-free extract exhibits authentic mirna response show translation initiation specifically cap recognition process repressed endogenous let mirnas within first minutes mrna exposure extract destabilization transcript observed results indicate inhibition translation initiation earliest molecular event effected mirnas mechanisms mrna degradation may subsequently consolidate mrna silencing
