critical role igf-ii memory consolidation enhancement 
report rat administering insulin-like growth factor ii igf-ii also known igf2 significantly enhances memory retention prevents forgetting inhibitory avoidance learning leads increase hippocampal expression igf-ii requires transcription factor ccaat enhancer binding protein beta essential memory consolidation furthermore injections recombinant igf-ii hippocampus either training memory retrieval significantly enhance memory retention prevent forgetting effective igf-ii needs administered within sensitive period memory consolidation igf-ii-dependent memory enhancement requires igf-ii receptors new protein synthesis function activity-regulated cytoskeletal-associated protein glycogen-synthase kinase gsk3 moreover correlates significant activation synaptic gsk3 beta increased expression glur1 also known gria1 alpha-amino--hydroxy--methyl--isoxasolepropionic acid receptor subunits hippocampal slices igf-ii promotes igf-ii receptor-dependent persistent long-term potentiation weak synaptic stimulation thus igf-ii may represent novel target cognitive enhancement therapies
