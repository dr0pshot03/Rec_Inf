global diversity geography soil fungi
fungi play major roles ecosystem processes determinants fungal diversity biogeographic patterns remain poorly understood using dna metabarcoding data hundreds globally distributed soil samples demonstrate fungal richness decoupled plant diversity plant-to-fungus richness ratio declines exponentially toward poles climatic factors followed edaphic spatial variables constitute best predictors fungal richness community composition global scale fungi show similar latitudinal diversity gradients organisms several notable exceptions findings advance understanding global fungal diversity patterns permit integration fungi general macroecological framework
