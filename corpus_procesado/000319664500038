high-strength chemical-vapor deposited graphene grain boundaries
pristine graphene strongest material ever measured however large-area graphene films produced means chemical vapor deposition cvd polycrystalline thus contain grain boundaries can potentially weaken material combined structural characterization means transmission electron microscopy nanoindentation order study mechanical properties cvd-graphene films different grain sizes show elastic stiffness cvd-graphene identical pristine graphene postprocessing steps avoid damage rippling strength slightly reduced despite existence grain boundaries indentation tests directly grain boundaries confirm almost strong pristine graphene films consisting entirely well-stitched grain boundaries can retain ultrahigh strength critical large variety applications flexible electronics strengthening components
