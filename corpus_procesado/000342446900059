resident memory cd8 t cells trigger protective innate adaptive immune responses 
pathogen recognition theory dictates upon viral infection innate immune system first detects microbial products responds providing instructions adaptive cd8 t cells show mice tissue resident memory cd8 t cells t-rm cells non-recirculating cells located common sites infection can achieve near-sterilizing immunity viral infections reversing flow information upon antigen resensitization within mouse female reproductive mucosae cd8+ t-rm cells secrete cytokines trigger rapid adaptive innate immune responses including local humoral responses maturation local dendritic cells activation natural killer cells provided near-sterilizing immunity antigenically unrelated viral infection thus cd8+ t-rm cells rapidly trigger antiviral state amplifying receptor-derived signals previously encountered pathogens
