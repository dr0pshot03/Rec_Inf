optical manipulation nanoparticles biomolecules sub-wavelength slot waveguides 
ability manipulate nanoscopic matter precisely critical development active nanosystems optical tweezers- excellent tools transporting particles ranging size fromseveral micrometres hundred nanometres manipulation dielectric objects much smaller diameters however requires stronger optical confinement higher intensities can provided diffraction limited systems present approach optofluidic transport overcomes limitations using sub-wavelength liquid core slot waveguides technique simultaneously makes use near field optical forces confine matter inside waveguide scattering/ adsorption forces transport ability slot waveguide condense accessible electromagnetic energy scales small nm allows us also overcome fundamental diffraction problem apply approach trapping transport nm dielectric nanoparticles lambda-dna molecules trapping occurs along line rather point traditional point traps method provides ability handle extended biomolecules directly also carry detailed numerical analysis relates near field optical forces release kinetics believe architecture demonstrated will help bridge gap optical manipulation nanofluidics
