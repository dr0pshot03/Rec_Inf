enzymatic activation voltage-gated potassium channels
voltage gated ion channels excitable nerve muscle endocrine cells generate electric signals form action potentials however also present non excitable eukaryotic cells prokaryotes raises question whether voltage gated channels might activated means changing voltage difference solutions separated plasma membrane search called voltage gated channel activators motivated part growing importance agents clinical pharmacology report apparent activation voltage gated k+ kv channels sphingomyelinase
