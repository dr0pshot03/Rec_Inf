auditory spatial receptive fields created multiplication
examples multiplication neurons neural circuits scarce although many computational models use basic operation owls auditory system computes interaural time itd level ild differences create two-dimensional map auditory space space-specific neurons selective combinations itd ild define respectively horizontal vertical dimensions receptive fields multiplication separate postsynaptic potentials tuned itd ild rather addition can account subthreshold responses neurons itd-ild pairs nonlinear processes improve spatial tuning spike output reduce fit multiplicative model
