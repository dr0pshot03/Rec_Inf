highly stretchable tough hydrogels 
hydrogels used scaffolds tissue engineering vehicles drug delivery actuators optics fluidics model extracellular matrices biological studies scope hydrogel applications however often severely limited mechanical behaviour hydrogels exhibit high stretchability example alginate hydrogel ruptures stretched times original length synthetic elastic hydrogels achieved stretches range values markedly reduced samples containing notches hydrogels brittle fracture energies j m- ref compared similar j m- cartilage similar j m- natural rubbers intense efforts devoted synthesizing hydrogels improved mechanical properties- certain synthetic gels reached fracture energies j m- refs report synthesis hydrogels polymers forming ionically covalently crosslinked networks although gels contain similar % water can stretched beyond times initial length fracture energies similar j m- even samples containing notches stretch demonstrated attribute gels toughness synergy two mechanisms: crack bridging network covalent crosslinks hysteresis unzipping network ionic crosslinks furthermore network covalent crosslinks preserves memory initial state much large deformation removed unloading unzipped ionic crosslinks cause internal damage heals re-zipping gels may serve model systems explore mechanisms deformation energy dissipation expand scope hydrogel applications
