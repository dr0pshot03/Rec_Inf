interactive memory systems human brain
learning memory humans rely upon several memory systems appear dissociable brain substrates fundamental question concerns whether memory systems interact show using functional magnetic resonance imaging fmri memory systems may compete classification learning humans medial temporal lobe basal ganglia differently engaged across subjects classification learning depending upon whether task emphasized declarative nondeclarative memory even to-be-learned material level performance differ consistent competition memory systems suggested animal studies neuroimaging activity regions negatively correlated across individuals examination classification learning using event-related fmri showed rapid modulation activity regions beginning learning suggesting subjects relied upon medial temporal lobe early learning however dependence rapidly declined training predicted previous computational models associative learning-
