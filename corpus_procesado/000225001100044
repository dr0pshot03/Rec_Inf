autophagy defends cells invading group streptococcus 
found autophagic machinery effectively eliminate pathogenic group streptococcus gas within nonphagocytic cells escaping endosomes cytoplasm gas became enveloped autophagosome-like compartments killed upon fusion compartments lysosomes autophagy-deficient atg5-/- cells gas survived multiplied released cells thus autophagic machinery can act innate defense system invading pathogens
