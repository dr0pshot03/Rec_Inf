human telomere biology: contributory interactive factor aging disease risks protection 
telomeres protective end-complexes termini eukaryotic chromosomes telomere attrition can lead potentially maladaptive cellular changes block cell division interfere tissue replenishment recent advances understanding human disease processes clarified roles telomere biology especially diseases human aging aging-related processes greater overall telomere attrition predicts mortality aging-related diseases inherited telomere syndrome patients also general human cohorts however genetically caused variations telomere maintenance either raise lower risks progression cancers highly cancer type-specific fashion telomere maintenance determined genetic factors also cumulatively shaped nongenetic influences throughout human life can interact recent findings highlight causal potentiating roles telomere attrition human diseases
