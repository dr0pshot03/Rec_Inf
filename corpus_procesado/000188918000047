modulation th1 activation inflammation nf-kappa b repressor foxj1
forkhead transcription factors play key roles regulation immune responses identify role one member family foxj1 regulation t cell activation autoreactivity foxj1 deficiency resulted multiorgan systemic inflammation exaggerated th1 cytokine production t cell proliferation autologous mixed lymphocyte reactions foxj1 suppressed nf-kappab transcription activity vitro foxj1-deficient t cells possessed increased nf-kappab activity vivo correlating ability foxj1 regulate ikappab proteins particularly ikappabbeta thus foxj1 likely modulates inflammatory reactions prevents autoimmunity antagonizing proinflammatory transcriptional activities results suggest potentially general role forkhead genes enforcement lymphocyte quiescence
