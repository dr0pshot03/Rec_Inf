quantum superposition distinct macroscopic states
schrodinger attempted demonstrate limitations quantum mechanics using thought experiment cat put quantum superposition alive dead states idea remained academic curiosity 1980s proposed- suitable conditions macroscopic object many microscopic degrees freedom behave quantum mechanically provided sufficiently decoupled environment although much progress made demonstrating macroscopic quantum behaviour various systems superconductors- nanoscale magnets- laser-cooled trapped ions photons microwave cavity c molecules experimental demonstration quantum superposition truly macroscopically distinct states present experimental evidence superconducting quantum interference device squid can put superposition two magnetic-flux states: one corresponding microamperes current flowing clockwise corresponding amount current flowing anticlockwise
