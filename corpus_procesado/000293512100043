high-speed atomic force microscopy reveals rotary catalysis rotorless f--atpase 
f- adenosine triphosphate atp-driven motor three torque-generating beta subunits alpha3beta3 stator ring sequentially undergo conformational changes upon atp hydrolysis rotate central shaft gamma unidirectionally although extensive experimental theoretical work done structural basis cooperative torque generation realize unidirectional rotation remains elusive used high-speed atomic force microscopy show rotorless f- still "rotates"; isolated alpha3beta3 stator ring three beta subunits cyclically propagate conformational states counterclockwise direction similar rotary shaft rotation f- structural basis unidirectionality programmed stator ring findings implications cooperative interplay subunits hexameric atpases
