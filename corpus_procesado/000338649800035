abnormalities human pluripotent cells due reprogramming mechanisms
human pluripotent stem cells hold potential regenerative medicine available cell types significant limitations although embryonic stemcells es cells vitro fertilized embryos ivfes cells represent gold standard allogeneic patients autologous induced pluripotent stem cells ips cells prone epigenetic transcriptional aberrations determine whether abnormalities intrinsic somatic cell reprogramming secondary reprogramming method genetically matched sets human ivf es cells ips cells nuclear transfer es cells nt es cells derived somatic cell nuclear transfer scnt subjected genome-wide analyses nt es cells ips cells derived somatic cells contained comparable numbers de novo copy number variations contrast dna methylation transcriptome profiles nt es cells corresponded closely ivf es cells whereas ips cells differed retained residual dna methylation patterns typical parental somatic cells thus human somatic cells can faithfully reprogrammed pluripotency scnt therefore ideal cell replacement therapies
