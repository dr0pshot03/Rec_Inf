lmo2 oncogene initiates leukemia mice inducing thymocyte self-renewal
lmo2 oncogene causes subset human t cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias t-all including four cases arose adverse events gene therapy trials investigate cellular origin lmo2-induced leukemia used cell fate mapping study mice lmo2 gene constitutively expressed thymus lmo2 induced self-renewal committed t cells mice months development overt t-all self-renewing cells retained capacity t cell differentiation expressed several genes typical hematopoietic stem cells hscs suggesting lmo2 might reactivate hsc-specific transcriptional program forced expression one gene hhex sufficient initiate self-renewal thymocytes vivo thus lmo2 promotes self-renewal preleukemic thymocytes providing mechanism committed t cells can accumulate additional genetic mutations required leukemic transformation
