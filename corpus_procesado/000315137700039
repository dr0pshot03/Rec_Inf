finding sources missing heritability yeast cross 
many traits including susceptibility common diseases humans causal loci uncovered genetic-mapping studies explain minority heritable contribution trait variation multiple explanations missing heritability proposed1 use large cross two yeast strains accurately estimate different sources heritable variation quantitative traits detect underlying loci high statistical power find detected loci explain nearly entire additive contribution heritable variation traits studied also show contribution heritability gene-gene interactions varies among traits near zero approximately per cent detected two-locus interactions explain minority contribution results substantially advance understanding missing heritability problem important implications
