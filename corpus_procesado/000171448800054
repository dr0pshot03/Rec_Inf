apolipoprotein influencing triglycerides humans mice revealed comparative sequencing 
comparison genomic dna sequences human mouse revealed new apolipoprotein apo gene apoav located proximal well-characterized apoai/ciii/aiv gene cluster human 11q23 mice expressing human apoav transgene showed decrease plasma triglyceride concentrations one-third control mice conversely knockout mice lacking apoav four times much plasma triglycerides controls humans single nucleotide polymorphisms snps across apoav locus found significantly associated plasma triglyceride levels two independent studies findings indicate apoav important determinant plasma triglyceride levels major risk factor coronary artery disease
