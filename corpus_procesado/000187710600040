pairing synapsis recombination prerequisites accurate chromosome segregation meiosis phs1 gene maize required pairing occur homologous chromosomes phs1 mutant homologous chromosome synapsis completely replaced synapsis nonhomologous partners phs1 gene also required installation meiotic recombination machinery chromosomes mutant almost completely lacks chromosomal foci recombination protein rad51 thus phs1 mutant synapsis uncoupled recombination pairing protein encoded phs1 gene likely acts multistep process coordinate pairing recombination synapsis
