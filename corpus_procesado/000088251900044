optimal shapes compact strings 
optimal geometrical arrangements stacking atoms relevance diverse disciplines- classic problem determination optimal arrangement spheres three dimensions order achieve highest packing fraction recently proved answer infinite systems face-centred-cubic lattice simply stated problem profound impact many areas- ranging crystallization melting atomic systems optimal packing objects sub-division space study analogous problem-that determining optimal shapes closely packed compact strings problem mathematical idealization situations commonly encountered biology chemistry physics involving optimal structure folded polymeric chains rnd cases boundary effects dominant helices particular pitch-radius ratio selected interestingly geometry observed helices naturally occurring proteins
