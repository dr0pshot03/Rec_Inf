preparing pure photon number states radiation field
quantum mechanical description radiation field based states characterized number photons particular mode basic quantum states fixed photon number usually referred number fock states although fock states vibrational motion can observed readily ion traps number states radiation field fragile difficult produce maintain single photons multi-mode fields generated using technique photon pairs order generate states cavity mode question must minimal losses moreover additional sources photon number fluctuations thermal field must eliminated observe build-up number states high-q cavity investigating interaction dynamics probe atom field employ dynamical method number state preparation involves state reduction highly excited atoms cavity photon lifetime high seconds set-up usually known one-atom maser micromaser pure states containing two photons measured unambiguously
