constraints evolution sex ratio adjustment 
relative fitness mate female offspring varies environmental conditions evolutionary theory predicts parents adjust sex offspring accordingly qualitative even quantitative support prediction striking taxa much less convincing others explaining variation across taxa fit sex ratio theory remains major challenge use meta-analysis test role two constraints evolution sex ratios based analysis sex ratio skews birds wasps show mechanisms sex determination necessarily constrain evolution sex ratio adjustment ii parental ability predict offsprings environment influences evolution sex ratio patterns across taxa generally results show multiple constraints may determine precision adaptation
