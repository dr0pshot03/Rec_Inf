olfactory systems encode odours neurons respond respond- mammals every sniff evokes precise odour-specific sequence activity across olfactory neurons- likewise variety neural systems ranging sensory periphery cognitive centres neuronal activity timed relative sampling behaviour and/or internally generated oscillations neural systems relative timing activity may represent information olfactory system however evidence mammalian olfactory systems read cues test whether mice perceive timing olfactory activation relative sniff cycle sniff phase used optogenetics gene-targeted mice generate spatially constant temporally controllable olfactory input show mice can behaviourally report sniff phase optogenetically driven activation olfactory sensory neurons furthermore mice can discriminate light-evoked inputs shifted sniff cycle little milliseconds similar temporal precision olfactory bulb odour responses electrophysiological recordings olfactory bulb awake mice show individual cells encode timing photoactivation relation sniff timing amplitude responses work provides evidence mammalian olfactory system can read temporal patterns suggests timing activity relative sampling behaviour potent cue may enable accurate olfactory percepts form quickly
