formation cubic ice conditions relevant earths atmosphere 
important mechanism ice cloud formation earths atmosphere homogeneous nucleation ice aqueous droplets process generally assumed produce hexagonal ice however reports metastable crystalline phase ice cubic ice may form earths atmosphere- present laboratory experiments demonstrating cubic ice forms micrometre-sized droplets pure water aqueous solutions freeze homogeneously cooling rates approaching found atmosphere find formation cubic ice dominant droplets freeze temperatures k temperature range relevant polar stratospheric clouds clouds tropical tropopause region results together heat transfer calculations suggest cubic ice will form earths atmosphere significant fraction cubic ice cold clouds increase water vapour pressure modify microphysics ice particle size distributions specific conditions may lead enhanced dehydration tropopause region
