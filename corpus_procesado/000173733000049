germline transmission tissue-specific expression transgenes delivered lentiviral vectors 
single-cell mouse embryos infected vitro recombinant lentiviral vectors generate transgenic mice carrying green fluorescent protein gfp gene driven ubiquitously expressing promoter eighty percent founder mice carried least one copy transgene % expressed gfp high levels progeny inherited transgenes displayed green fluorescence mice generated using lentiviral vectors muscle-specific t lymphocyte-specific promoters expressed high levels gfp appropriate cell types also generated transgenic rats express gfp high levels suggesting technique can used produce transgenic animal species
