gain control layer six cortical circuits vision
entering cerebral cortex sensory information spreads six different horizontal neuronal layers interconnected vertical axonal projections believed projections layers can influence others response sensory stimuli specific role layer cortical processing still poorly understood show layer six primary visual cortex mouse crucial role controlling gain visually evoked activity neurons upper layers without changing tuning orientation gain modulation results coordinated action layer six intracortical projections superficial layers deep projections thalamus substantial role intracortical circuit study establishes layer six major mediator cortical gain modulation suggests node convergent inputs several brain areas can regulate earliest steps cortical visual processing
