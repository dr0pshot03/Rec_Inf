cell surface abp1-tmk auxin-sensing complex activates rop gtpase signaling 
auxin-binding protein abp1 discovered nearly years ago shown essential plant development morphogenesis mode action remains unclear report plasma membrane-localized transmembrane kinase tmk receptor-like kinases interact abp1 transduce auxin signal activate plasma membrane-associated rops [rho-like guanosine triphosphatases gtpase plants] leading changes cytoskeleton shape leaf pavement cells arabidopsis interaction abp1 tmk cell surface induced auxin requires abp1 sensing auxin findings show tmk proteins abp1 form cell surface auxin perception complex activates rop signaling pathways regulating nontranscriptional cytoplasmic responses associated fundamental processes
