asymmetric syntheses sceptrin massadine evidence biosynthetic enantiodivergence 
cycloaddition essential tool chemical synthesis instead using light heat driving force marine sponges promote cycloaddition versatile poorly understood mechanism producing pyrrole-imidazole alkaloids sceptrin massadine ageliferin de novo synthesis sceptrin massadine show sponges may use single-electron oxidation central mechanism promote three different types cycloaddition additionally provide surprising evidence contrast previous reports sceptrin massadine ageliferin mismatched chirality therefore massadine oxidative rearrangement product sceptrin ageliferin commonly believed taken together results demonstrate unconventional chemical approaches achieving cycloaddition reactions synthesis uncover enantiodivergence new biosynthetic paradigm natural products
