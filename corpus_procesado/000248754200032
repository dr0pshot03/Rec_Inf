structure-based activity prediction enzyme unknown function
many genomes sequenced pressing challenge biology predicting function proteins genes encode proteins unrelated others known activity bioinformatics inference function becomes problematic thus useful interrogate protein structures function directly predict function enzyme unknown activity tm0936 thermotoga maritima docking high energy intermediate forms thousands candidate metabolites docking hit list dominated adenine analogues appeared undergo c6 deamination four including methylthioadenosine s adenosylhomocysteine sah tested substrates three substantial catalytic rate constants m s- x ray crystal structure complex tm0936 product resulting deamination sah s inosylhomocysteine determined corresponded closely predicted structure deaminated products can metabolized t maritima previously uncharacterized sah degradation pathway structure based docking high energy forms potential substrates may useful tool annotate enzymes function
