photosynthesis-induced biofilm calcification calcium concentrations phanerozoic oceans 
photosynthetic carbon assimilation commonly invoked cause calcium carbonate precipitation cyanobacterial biofilms results formation calcareous stromatolites however biofilm calcification patterns recent lakes simulation photosynthetically induced rise calcium carbonate supersaturation demonstrate mechanism applies settings low dissolved inorganic carbon high calcium taking account paleo-partial pressure curves carbon dioxide show phanerozoic oceans sustaining calcified cyanobacteria must considerably higher calcium concentrations oceans today turn enigmatic lack calcified cyanobacteria stromatolite-bearing precambrian sequences can now explained result high dissolved inorganic carbon concentrations
