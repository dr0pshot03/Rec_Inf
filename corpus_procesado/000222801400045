drosophila long-term memory formation involves regulation cathepsin activity
whereas short-term memory lasts minutes hours long-term memory ltm can last days even entire lifetime ltm generally forms spaced repeated training sessions involves regulation gene expression thereby implicating transcription factors initial steps ltm establishment however direct participation effector genes memory formation rarely documented many mechanisms involved ltm formation remain understood describe drosophila melanogaster mutant crammer cer shows specific ltm defect cer gene encodes inhibitor subfamily cysteine proteinases named cathepsins might involved human alzheimers disease cer peptide found mushroom bodies mbs drosophila olfactory memory centre glial cells around mbs overexpression cer glial cells mb neurons induces decrease ltm suggesting cer might role glia concentration cer peptide critical ltm wild-type flies cer expression transiently decreases ltm conditioning indicating cysteine proteinases activated early ltm formation
