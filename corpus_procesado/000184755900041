loss callose synthase results salicylic acid-dependent disease resistance 
plants attacked pathogens rapidly deposit callose beta--glucan wound sites traditionally deposition thought reinforce cell wall regarded defense response surprisingly found powdery mildew resistant pmr4 mutant lacking pathogen-induced callose became resistant pathogens rather susceptible resistance due mutation callose synthase resulting loss induced callose response double-mutant analysis indicated blocking salicylic acid sa defense signaling pathway sufficient restore susceptibility pmr4 mutants thus callose callose synthase negatively regulates sa pathway
