designing superoleophobic surfaces 
understanding complementary roles surface energy roughness natural nonwetting surfaces led development number biomimetic superhydrophobic surfaces exhibit apparent contact angles water greater degrees low contact angle hysteresis however superoleophobic surfaces-those display contact angles greater degrees organic liquids appreciably lower surface tensions water-are extremely rare calculations suggest creating surface require surface energy lower known material show third factor re-entrant surface curvature conjunction chemical composition roughened texture can used design surfaces display extreme resistance wetting number liquids low surface tension including alkanes decane octane
