climate change selects heterozygosity declining fur seal population 
global environmental change expected alter selection pressures many biological systems1- long-term molecular life history data required quantify changes selection rare4 unusual opportunity afforded three decades individual-based data collected declining population antarctic fur seals south atlantic climate change reduced prey availability caused significant decline seal birth weight however mean age size females recruiting breeding population increasing show females significantly higher heterozygosity measure within-individual genetic variation non-recruiting siblings mothers thus breeding female heterozygosity increased % per generation last two decades nonetheless heterozygosity inherited mothers daughters substantial heterozygote advantage transmitted one generation next decreasing viability homozygous individuals causes population decline results provide compelling evidence selection due climate change intensifying far-reaching consequences demography well phenotypic genetic variation
