colloids valence specific directional bonding 
ability design assemble three-dimensional structures colloidal particles limited absence specific directional bonds result complex low-coordination structures common atomic molecular systems rare colloidal domain demonstrate general method creating colloidal analogues atoms valence: colloidal particles chemically distinct surface patches imitate hybridized atomic orbitals including sp sp sp spd spd spd functionalized dna single-stranded sticky ends patches different particles can form highly directional bonds programmable specific reversible dna hybridization features allow particles self-assemble colloidal molecules triangular tetrahedral bonding symmetries also give access rich variety new microstructured colloidal materials
