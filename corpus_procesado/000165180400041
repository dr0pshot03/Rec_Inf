offset potential carbon sink boreal forestation decreases surface albedo
carbon uptake forestation one method proposed reduce net carbon dioxide emissions atmosphere limit radiative forcing climate change overall impact forestation climate will also depend effects associated creation new forests particular albedo forested landscape generally lower cultivated land especially snow lying- decreasing albedo exerts positive radiative forcing climate simulate radiative forcings associated changes surface albedo result forestation temperate boreal forest areas translate forcings equivalent changes local carbon stock comparison estimated carbon sequestration potentials- suggest many boreal forest areas positive forcing induced decreases albedo can offset negative forcing expected carbon sequestration high-latitude forestation activities may therefore increase climate change rather mitigating intended
