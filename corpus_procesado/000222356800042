evidence deep-water production north pacific ocean early cenozoic warm interval 
deep-ocean circulation responsible significant component global heat transport present mode circulation deep waters formin north atlantic southern oceans surface water becomes sufficiently cold dense sink polar temperatures warmest climatic interval cenozoic era similar to65 million years myr ago significantly warmer today may consequence enhanced oceanic heat transport however understanding relationship deep-ocean circulation ancient climate complicated differences oceanic gateways affect deep waters form circulate report records neodymium isotopes two cores pacific ocean indicate shift deep-water production southern ocean north pacific similar to65 myr ago source deep waters reverted back southern ocean myr ago relative timing changes neodymium oxygen isotope records indicates changes cenozoic deep-water circulation patterns consequence cause extreme cenozoic warmth
