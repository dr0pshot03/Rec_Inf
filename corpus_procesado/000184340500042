vdac2 inhibits bak activation mitochondrial apoptosis 
multidomain proapoptotic molecules bak bax required initiate mitochondrial pathway apoptosis cells maintain potentially lethal proapoptotic effector bak monomeric inactive conformation mitochondria unknown viable cells found bak complexed mitochondrial outer-membrane protein vdac2 vdac isoform present low abundance interacts specifically inactive conformer bak cells deficient vdac2 cells lacking abundant vdac1 exhibited enhanced bak oligomerization susceptible apoptotic death conversely overexpression vdac2 selectively prevented bak activation inhibited mitochondrial apoptotic pathway death signals activate "bh3-only" molecules tbid bim bad displace vdac2 bak enabling homo-oligomerization bak apoptosis thus vdac2 isoform restricted mammals regulates activity bak provides connection mitochondrial physiology core apoptotic pathway
