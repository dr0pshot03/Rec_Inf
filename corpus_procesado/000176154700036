architecture large-scale ion-trap quantum computer 
among numerous types architecture explored quantum computers systems utilizing ion traps quantum bits qubits formed electronic states trapped ions coupled coulomb interaction although elementary requirements quantum computation demonstrated system exist theoretical technical obstacles scaling approach large numbers qubits therefore recent efforts concentrated using quantum communication link number small ion-trap quantum systems developing array-based approach show achieve massively parallel gate operation large-scale quantum computer based techniques already demonstrated manipulating small quantum registers use decoherence-free subspaces significantly reduces decoherence ion transport removes requirement clock synchronization interaction regions
