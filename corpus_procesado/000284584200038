bose-einstein condensation bec-the macroscopic ground-state accumulation particles integer spin bosons low temperature high density-has observed several physical systems- including cold atomic gases solid-state quasiparticles however omnipresent bose gas blackbody radiation radiation thermal equilibrium cavity walls show phase transition systems photons vanishing chemical potential meaning number conserved temperature photon gas varied low temperatures photons disappear cavity walls instead occupying cavity ground state theoretical works considered thermalization processes conserve photon number prerequisite bec involving compton scattering gas thermal electrons photon-photon scattering nonlinear resonator configuration number-conserving thermalization experimentally observed two-dimensional photon gas dye-filled optical microcavity acts white-wall box report observation bose-einstein condensate photons system cavity mirrors provide confining potential nonvanishing effective photon mass making system formally equivalent two-dimensional gas trapped massive bosons photons thermalize temperature dye solution room temperature multiple scattering dye molecules upon increasing photon density observe following bec signatures: photon energies bose-einstein distribution massively populated ground-state mode top broad thermal wing phase transition occurs expected photon density exhibits predicted dependence cavity geometry ground-state mode emerges even spatially displaced pump spot prospects observed effects include studies extremely weakly interacting low-dimensional bose gases new coherent ultraviolet sources
