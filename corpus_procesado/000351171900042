temperature representation drosophila brain 
drosophila rapid temperature changes detected periphery dedicated receptors forming simple sensory map hot cold brain however flies show host complex innate learned responses temperature indicating able extract range information simple input define anatomical physiological repertoire temperature representation drosophila brain first use photolabelling strategy trace connections relay peripheral thermosensory information higher brain centres show largely converge onto three target regions: mushroom body lateral horn well known centres sensory processing posterior lateral protocerebrum region now define major site thermosensory representation next using vivo calcium imaging describe thermosensory projection neurons selectively activated hot cold stimuli fast-adapting neurons display transient responses track rapid temperature shifts remarkably well slow-adapting cell responses better reflect magnitude simple thermal changes unexpectedly also find population broadly tuned cells respond heating cooling show required normal behavioural avoidance hot cold simple two-choice temperature preference assay taken together results uncover coordinated ensemble neural responses temperature drosophila brain demonstrate broadly tuned thermal line contributes rapid avoidance behaviour illustrate stimulus quality temporal structure intensity can extracted simple glomerular map single synaptic station
