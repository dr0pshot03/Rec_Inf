intense stratospheric jet jupiter 
earths equatorial stratosphere shows oscillations east west winds reverse direction temperatures change cyclically period two years phenomenon called quasi-biennial oscillation also affects dynamics mid high-latitude stratosphere weather lower atmosphere ground-based observations suggested- similar temperature oscillations -yr cycle occur jupiter data suffer poor vertical resolution jupiters stratospheric wind velocities yet determined report maps temperatures winds high spatial resolution obtained spacecraft measurements infrared spectra jupiters stratosphere find intense high-altitude equatorial jet speed similar to140 m s- whose spatial structure resembles quasi-quadrennial oscillation wave activity stratosphere also appears analogous occurring earth strong interaction jupiter plasma environment produces hot spots upper atmosphere stratosphere near poles- temperature maps define penetration hot spots stratosphere
