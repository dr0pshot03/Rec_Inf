inclusion body formation reduces levels mutant huntingtin risk neuronal death 
huntingtons disease caused abnormal polyglutamine expansion within protein huntingtin characterized microscopic inclusion bodies aggregated huntingtin death selected types neuron whether inclusion bodies pathogenic incidental beneficial coping response controversial resolve issue developed automated microscope returns precisely neuron arbitrary intervals even cells removed microscope stage show survival analysis neurons die time-independent fashion one dependent mutant huntingtin dose polyglutamine expansion; many neurons die without forming inclusion body rather amount diffuse intracellular huntingtin predicts whether inclusion body formation death will occur surprisingly inclusion body formation predicts improved survival leads decreased levels mutant huntingtin elsewhere neuron thus inclusion body formation can function coping response toxic mutant huntingtin
