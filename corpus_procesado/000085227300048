ontogeny orientation flight honeybee revealed harmonic radar 
cognitive ethology focuses study animals natural conditions reveal ecologically adapted modes learning biologists can easily study animal learns learns example honeybees take repeated orientation flights becoming foragers three weeks age flights prerequisite successful homing little known flights orienting bees rapidly fly range human observation using harmonic radar show first time striking ontogeny honeybee orientation flights increased experience bees hold trip duration constant fly faster later trips cover larger area earlier trips addition flight typically restricted narrow sector around hive orientation flights provide honeybees repeated opportunities view hive landscape features different viewpoints suggesting bees learn local landscape progressive fashion also show changes orientation flight related number previous flights taken instead chronological age suggesting learning process adapted changes weather conditions flower availability needs bee colonies
