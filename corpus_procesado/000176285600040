collimated jet molecular gas star asymptotic giant branch
evolved stars one solar mass general spherically symmetric yet planetary nebulae produce next phase evolution tend exhibit symmetry collimated jets outflows material observed- similar to0 parsec central stars planetary nebulae precession jets proposed explain observed asymmetries moreover recently shown theoretically magnetic fields launch collimate jets report detection collimated precessing jet molecular gas traced water-vapour maser spots similar to500 astronomical units au star w43a aquila conclude jet formed immediate vicinity star infer elongated planetary nebulae formed jets short period less years star makes transition proto-planetary nebula phase become planetary nebula
