parsimonious model gene regulation mirnas 
micrornas mirnas small interfering rnas sirnas act argonaute family proteins regulate target messenger rnas mrnas posttranscriptionally sirnas typically induce endonucleolytic cleavage mrna near-perfect complementarity targets less complementarity translational repression mrna destabilization mechanisms implicated mirna-mediated gene repression although timing coupling relative importance events determined review gene-specific global approaches probe mirna function mechanism looking unifying model systematic analyses molecular specificities core components coupled analysis relative timing different events will ultimately shed light mechanism mirna-mediated repression
