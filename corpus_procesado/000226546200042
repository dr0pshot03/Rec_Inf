stage-structured cycles promote genetic diversity predator-prey system daphnia algae
competition theory predicts population fluctuations can promote genetic diversity combined density-dependent selection however stabilizing mechanism rarely tested recently rejected explanation maintaining diversity natural populations freshwater herbivore daphnia pulex primary limitation competition theory failure account alternative types population cycles caused size stage-dependent population vital rates even though structure explains fluctuating dynamics many species may alter outcome competition provide first experimental test whether alternative types cycles affect natural selection predator prey systems using competing daphnia genotypes show internally generated stage-structured cycles substantially reduce magnitude selection thereby contributing maintenance genetic diversity whereas externally forced cycles show rapid competitive exclusion change selection ecologically significant spanning observed range natural populations argue structured cycles reduce selection combination stalled juvenile development stage-specific mortality potentially general fitness-equalizing mechanism may reduce need strong stabilizing mechanisms explain maintenance genetic diversity natural systems
