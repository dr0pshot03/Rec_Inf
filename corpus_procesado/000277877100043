five-vertebrate chip-seq reveals evolutionary dynamics transcription factor binding
transcription factors tfs direct gene expression binding dna regulatory regions explore evolution gene regulation used chromatin immunoprecipitation high-throughput sequencing chip-seq determine experimentally genome-wide occupancy two tfs ccaat/enhancer-binding protein alpha hepatocyte nuclear factor alpha livers five vertebrates although tf displays highly conserved dna binding preferences binding species-specific aligned binding events present five species rare regions near genes expression levels dependent tf often bound tf multiple species yet show enhanced dna sequence constraint binding divergence species can largely explained sequence changes bound motifs among binding events lost one lineage half recovered another binding event within kilobases results reveal large interspecies differences transcriptional regulation provide insight regulatory evolution
