mmset regulates histone h4k20 methylation 53bp1 accumulation dna damage sites 
p53-binding protein 53bp1 known important mediator dna damage response dimethylation histone h4 lysine h4k20me2 critical recruitment 53bp1 double-strand breaks dsbs however clear 53bp1 specifically targeted sites dna damage overall level h4k20me2 seem increase following dna damage proposed dna breaks may cause exposure methylated h4k20 previously buried within chromosome however experimental evidence model lacking found h4k20 methylation actually increases locally upon induction dsbs methylation h4k20 dsbs mediated histone methyltransferase mmset also known nsd2 whsc1 mammals downregulation mmset significantly decreases h4k20 methylation dsbs subsequent accumulation 53bp1 furthermore found recruitment mmset dsbs requires gamma h2ax-mdc1 pathway specifically interaction mdc1 brct domain phosphorylated ser mmset thus propose pathway involving gamma h2ax-mdc1-mmset regulates induction h4k20 methylation histones around dsbs turn facilitates 53bp1 recruitment
