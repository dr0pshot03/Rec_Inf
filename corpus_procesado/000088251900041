gain-assisted superluminal light propagation
einsteins theory special relativity principle causality- imply speed moving object exceed light vacuum c nevertheless exist various proposals- observing faster-than-c propagation light pulses using anomalous dispersion near absorption line- nonlinear linear gain lines- tunnelling barriers however previous experimental demonstrations light pulses experienced either large absorption severe reshaping resulting controversies interpretation use gain-assisted linear anomalous dispersion demonstrate superluminal light propagation atomic caesium gas group velocity laser pulse region exceeds c can even become negative shape pulse preserved measure group-velocity index ng +/- practice means light pulse propagating atomic vapour cell appears exit side much earlier propagated distance vacuum peak pulse appears leave cell entering observed superluminal light pulse propagation odds causality direct consequence classical interference different frequency components anomalous dispersion region
