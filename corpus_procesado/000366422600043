malaria parasites target hepatocyte receptor epha2 successful host infection 
invasion suitable host hepatocyte mosquito-transmitted plasmodium sporozoites essential early step successful malaria parasite infection yet precisely sporozoites target host cell facilitate productive infection remains largely unknown found hepatocyte epha2 receptor critical establishing permissive intracellular replication compartment parasitophorous vacuole sporozoites productively infected hepatocytes high epha2 expression deletion epha2 protected mice liver infection lack host epha2 phenocopied lack sporozoite proteins p52 p36 data suggest p36 engages epha2 likely key step establishing permissive replication compartment
