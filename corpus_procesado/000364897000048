nlrp6 regulates intestinal antiviral innate immunity
nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor nlrp maintains gut microbiota homeostasis regulates antibacterial immunity now report role nlrp6 control enteric virus infection nlrp6-/- control mice systemically challenged encephalomyocarditis virus similar mortality however gastrointestinal tract nlrp6-/- mice exhibited increased viral loads nirp6-/- mice orally infected encephalomyocarditis virus increased mortality viremia compared controls similar results observed murine norovirus nlrp6 bound viral rna via rna helicase dhx15 interacted mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein induce type i/iii interferons ifns ifn-stimulated genes isgs data demonstrate nlrp6 functions dhx15 viral rna sensor induce isgs effect especially important intestinal tract
