anisotropic hydrogel electrostatic repulsion cofacially aligned nanosheets
machine technology frequently puts magnetic electrostatic repulsive forces practical use maglev trains vehicle suspensions non-contact bearings contrast materials design overwhelmingly focuses attractive interactions many advanced polymer-based composites inorganic fillers interact polymer matrix improve mechanical properties however articular cartilage strikingly illustrates electrostatic repulsion can harnessed achieve unparalleled functional efficiency: permits virtually friction-less mechanical motion within joints even high compression describe composite hydrogel anisotropic mechanical properties dominated electrostatic repulsion negatively charged unilamellar titanate nanosheets embedded within crucial behaviour hydrogel serendipitous discovery cofacial nanosheet alignment aqueous colloidal dispersions subjected strong magnetic field maximizes electrostatic repulsion thereby induces quasi-crystalline structural ordering macroscopic length scales uniformly large face-to-face nanosheet separation fix transiently induced structural order transforming dispersion hydrogel using light-triggered situ vinyl polymerization resultant hydrogel containing charged inorganic structures align cofacially magnetic flux- deforms easily shear forces applied parallel embedded nanosheets yet resists compressive forces applied orthogonally anticipate concept embedding anisotropic repulsive electrostatics within composite material inspired articular cartilage will open new possibilities developing soft materials unusual functions
