overlapping protein-coding region influenza virus segment modulates host response 
influenza virus iav infection leads variable imperfectly understood pathogenicity report segment virus contains second open reading frame "x-orf" accessed via ribosomal frameshifting frameshift product termed pa-x comprises endonuclease domain viral pa protein c-terminal domain encoded x-orf functions repress cellular gene expression pa-x also modulates iav virulence mouse infection model acting decrease pathogenicity loss pa-x expression leads changes kinetics global host response notably includes increases inflammatory apoptotic t lymphocyte-signaling pathways thus identified previously unknown iav protein modulates host response infection finding important implications understanding iav pathogenesis
