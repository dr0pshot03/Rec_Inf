high-resolution record climate stability france last interglacial period
last interglacial period kyr ago considered analogue present interglacial period holocene may help us understand present climate evolution whereas holocene climate essentially stable europe variability climate last interglacial period remained unresolved climate reconstructions ice cores continental records marine sediment cores give conflicting results period present high-resolution multi-proxy lacustrine record climate change last interglacial period based oxygen isotopes diatom silica diatom assemblages pollen-climate transfer functions ribains maar france contrary previous study data show cold event interrupting warm interglacial climate instead rnd early temperature maximum transition colder climate halfway sequence end interglacial period clearly marked abrupt change proxy records study confirms southwestern europe last interglacial period time climatic stability therefore still likely represent useful analogue present climate
