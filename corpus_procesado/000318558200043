structure bacterial energy-coupling factor transporter
energy-coupling factor ecf transporters constitute novel family conserved membrane transporters prokaryotes similar domain organization atp-binding cassette transporters- ecf transporter comprises pair cytosolic atpases components ecfa ecfa membrane-embedded substrate-binding protein s component ecfs transmembrane energy-coupling component t component ecft links ecfa-ecfa subcomplex ecfs structure transport mechanism quaternary ecf transporter remain largely unknown report crystal structure nucleotide-free ecf transporter lactobacillus brevis resolution angstrom t component horseshoe-shaped open architecture five alpha-helices transmembrane segments two cytoplasmic alpha-helices coupling modules connecting components strikingly s component thought specific hydroxymethyl pyrimidine lies horizontally along lipid membrane bound exclusively five transmembrane segments two cytoplasmic helices t component structural features suggest plausible working model transport cycle ecf transporters
