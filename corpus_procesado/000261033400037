high harmonic generation multiple orbitals n2 
molecular electronic states energetically highest occupied molecular orbital homo contribute laser driven high harmonic generation hhg behavior observed previously measurements hhg spectrum n2 molecules aligned perpendicular laser polarization showed maximum rotational half revival feature indicates influence electrons occupying orbital just n2 homo referred homo- observations lower lying orbitals essential understanding subfemtosecond/subangstrom electronic motion laser excited molecules
