dna origami complex curvatures three-dimensional space
present strategy design construct self-assembling dna nanostructures define intricate curved surfaces three-dimensional 3d space using dna origami folding technique double-helical dna bent follow rounded contours target object potential strand crossovers subsequently identified concentric rings dna used generate in-plane curvature constrained 2d rationally designed geometries crossover networks out-of-plane curvature introduced adjusting particular position pattern crossovers adjacent dna double helices whose conformation often deviates natural b-form twist density series dna nanostructures high curvature-such 2d arrangements concentric rings 3d spherical shells ellipsoidal shells nanoflask-were assembled
