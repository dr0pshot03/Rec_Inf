observation individual vortices trapped along columnar defects high-temperature superconductors
many superconductors entirely expel magnetic flux-rather magnetic flux can penetrate superconducting state form vortices moving vortices create resistance must pinned permit dissipationless current flow particularly important issue high-transition-temperature superconductors vortices move easily irradiation superconducting samples heavy ions produces columnar defects considered optimal pinning traps orientation column coincides vortex line although columnar defect pinning investigated using macroscopic techniques hitherto impossible resolve individual vortices intersecting individual defects achieve resolution required image vortex lines columnar defects bi2sr2cacu2o8+delta bi- thin films using mv field-emission electron microscope thin films rnd vortex lines higher temperatures trapped oriented along tilted columnar defects irrespective orientation applied magnetic field lower temperatures however vortex penetration always takes place perpendicular film plane suggesting intrinsic background pinning material now dominates
