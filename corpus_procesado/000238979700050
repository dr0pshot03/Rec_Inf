cargo-binding domain regulates structure activity myosin
myosin two-headed motor protein moves cargoes along actin filaments tail ends paired globular tail domains gtds thought bind cargo nanomolar calcium levels actin-activated atpase low molecule folded micromolar calcium concentrations activate atpase molecule unfolds- describe structure folded myosin gtds role regulating activity electron microscopy shows two heads lie either side tail contacting gtds lobe motor domain similar pro pro contains conserved acidic side chains suggesting ionic interactions motor domain gtd myosin heavy meromyosin constitutively active fragment lacking gtds inhibited folded dimeric gst gtd fusion protein motility assays reveal nanomolar calcium levels heavy meromyosin moves robustly actin filaments whereas myosins bind move results combine show cargo gtds bind intramolecular manner motor domains producing inhibited compact structure binds weakly actin allows molecule recycle towards new cargoes
