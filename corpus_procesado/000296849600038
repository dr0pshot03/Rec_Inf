direct observation molecular preorganization chirality transfer catalyst surface 
chemisorption specific optically active compounds metal surfaces can create catalytically active chirality transfer sites however mechanism sites bias stereoselectivity reactions typically hydrogenations generally assumed complex continued progress area uncertain show investigation heterogeneous asymmetric induction single-site resolution sufficient distinguish stereochemical conformations submolecular level finally accessible combination scanning tunneling microscopy density functional theory calculations reveals stereodirecting forces governing preorganization precise chiral modifier-substrate bimolecular surface complexes study shows chiral modifier induces prochiral switching surface different prochiral ratios prevail different submolecular binding sites modifier reaction temperature
