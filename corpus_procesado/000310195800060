elfn1 regulates target-specific release probability ca1-interneuron synapses
although synaptic transmission may unidirectional establishment synaptic connections specific properties can involve bidirectional signaling pyramidal neurons hippocampus form functionally distinct synapses onto two types interneurons excitatory synapses onto oriens-lacunosum moleculare o-lm interneurons facilitating low release probability whereas synapses onto parvalbumin interneurons depressing high release probability show extracellular leucine-rich repeat fibronectin containing elfn1 protein selectively expressed o-lm interneurons regulates presynaptic release probability direct formation highly facilitating pyramidal-o-lm synapses thus postsynaptic expression elfn1 o-lm interneurons regulates presynaptic release probability confers target-specific synaptic properties pyramidal cell axons
