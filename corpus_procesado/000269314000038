l1 retrotransposition human neural progenitor cells 
long interspersed element line l1 retrotransposons markedly affected human genome l1s must retrotranspose germ line early development ensure evolutionary success yet extent process affects somatic cells poorly understood previously demonstrated engineered human l1s can retrotranspose adult rat hippocampus progenitor cells vitro mouse brain vivo demonstrate neural progenitor cells isolated human fetal brain derived human embryonic stem cells support retrotransposition engineered human l1s vitro furthermore developed quantitative multiplex polymerase chain reaction detected increase copy number endogenous l1s hippocampus several regions adult human brains compared copy number endogenous l1s heart liver genomic dnas donor data suggest de novo l1 retrotransposition events may occur human brain principle potential contribute individual somatic mosaicism
