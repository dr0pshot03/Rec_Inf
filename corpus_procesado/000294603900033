high plant diversity needed maintain ecosystem services 
biodiversity rapidly declining worldwide1 consensus can decrease ecosystem functioning services2- remains unclear though whether few8 many9 species ecosystem needed sustain provisioning ecosystem services hypothesized species promote ecosystem services many times places functions environmental changes considered9; however previous study considered factors together show % grassland plant species studied biodiversity experiments promoted ecosystem functioning least different species promoted ecosystem functioning different years different places different functions different environmental change scenarios furthermore species needed provide one function multiple years needed provide multiple functions within one year results indicate even species will needed maintain ecosystem functioning services previously suggested studies either considered number species needed promote one function one set environmental conditions separately considered importance biodiversity providing ecosystem functioning across multiple years10- places1516 functions141718 environmental change scenarios1219- therefore although species may appear functionally redundant one function considered one set environmental conditions7 many species needed maintain multiple functions multiple times places changing world
