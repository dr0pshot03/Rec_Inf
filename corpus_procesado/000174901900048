dissecting glucose signalling diversity-oriented synthesis small-molecule microarrays 
small molecules alter protein function provide means modulate biological networks temporal resolution demonstrate potentially general scalable method identifying molecules application particular protein ure2p represses transcription factors gln3p nil1p1- probing high-density microarray small molecules generated diversity-oriented synthesis fluorescently labelled ure2p performed protein-binding assays parallel identified several compounds bind ure2p one compound call uretupamine specifically activates glucose-sensitive transcriptional pathway downstream ure2p whole-genome transcription profiling chemical epistasis demonstrate remarkable ure2p specificity uretupamine ability modulate glucose-sensitive subset genes downstream ure2p results demonstrate diversity-oriented synthesis small-molecule microarrays can used identify small molecules bind protein interest small molecules can regulate specific functions protein
