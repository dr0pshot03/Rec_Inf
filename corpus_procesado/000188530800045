pest domain-enriched tyrosine phosphatase pep regulation effector/memory t cells
protein tyrosine kinases phosphatases cooperate regulate normal immune cell function examined role pest domain enriched tyrosine phosphatase pep regulating t cell antigen receptor function thymocyte development peripheral t cell differentiation although normal naive t cell functions retained pep-deficient mice effector/memory t cells demonstrated enhanced activation lck turn resulted increased expansion function effector/memory t cell pool also associated spontaneous development germinal centers elevated serum antibody levels results revealed central role pep negatively regulating specific aspects t cell development function
