neutrophil elastase targets virulence factors enterobacteria 
shigellae cause bacillary dysentery bloody form diarrhoea affects almost million people causes nearly million deaths per year shigella invades colonic mucosa initiates acute inflammation rich neutrophils initially contributes tissue damage eventually resolves infection neutrophils phagocytic cells kill microorganisms unclear neutrophils control pathogenic bacteria expressing virulence factors manipulate host cells contrast cells neutrophils prevent escape shigella phagocytic vacuoles bacteria killed identify human neutrophil elastase ne key host defence protein: ne degrades shigella virulence factors -fold lower concentration needed degrade bacterial proteins neutrophils ne inactivated pharmacologically genetically shigella escapes phagosomes increasing bacterial survival ne also preferentially cleaves virulence factors salmonella yersinia findings establish ne first neutrophil factor targets bacterial virulence proteins
