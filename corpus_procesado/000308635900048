human es-cell-derived cardiomyocytes electrically couple suppress arrhythmias injured hearts 
transplantation studies mice rats shown human embryonic-stem-cell-derived cardiomyocytes hesc-cms can improve function infarcted hearts1- two critical issues related electrophysiological behaviour vivo remain unresolved first risk arrhythmias following hesc-cm transplantation injured hearts determined second electromechanical integration hesc-cms injured hearts demonstrated unclear whether cells improve contractile function directly addition new force-generating units use guinea-pig model show hesc-cm grafts injured hearts protect arrhythmias can contract synchronously host muscle injured hearts hesc-cm grafts show improved mechanical function significantly reduced incidence spontaneous induced ventricular tachycardia assess activity hesc-cm grafts vivo transplanted hesc-cms expressing genetically encoded calcium sensor gcamp3 refs correlating gcamp3 fluorescent signal host ecg found grafts uninjured hearts consistent : host-graft coupling grafts injured hearts heterogeneous typically include coupled uncoupled regions thus human myocardial grafts meet physiological criteria true heart regeneration providing support continued development hesc-based cardiac therapies mechanical electrical repair
