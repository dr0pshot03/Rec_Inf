nuclear pore scaffold structure analyzed super-resolution microscopy particle averaging
much lifes essential molecular machinery consists large protein assemblies currently pose challenges structure determination prominent example nuclear pore complex npc organization individual components remains unknown combining stochastic super-resolution microscopy directly resolve ringlike structure npc single particle averaging use information thousands pores determined average positions fluorescent molecular labels npc precision well nanometer applying approach systematically largest building block npc nup107 subcomplex assessed structure npc scaffold thus light microscopy can used study molecular organization large protein complexes situ whole cells
