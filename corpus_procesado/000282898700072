proteasome antechamber maintains substrates unfolded state
eukaryotes archaea use protease called proteasome integral role maintaining cellular function selective degradation proteins- proteolysis occurs barrelshaped 20s core particle thermoplasma acidophilum built four stacked homoheptameric rings subunits alpha beta arranged alphabetabetaalpha ref rings form three interconnected cavities including pair antechambers formed alphabeta substrates passed degradation catalytic chamber betabeta peptide-bond hydrolysis reaction occurs although clear substrates must unfolded enter narrow gated passageways angstrom diameter located alpha-rings structural dynamical properties substrates inside proteasome antechamber remain unclear confinement antechamber might expected promote folding thus impede proteolysis investigate folding stability dynamics three small protein substrates antechamber methyl transverse-relaxation-optimized nmr spectroscopy show substrates interact actively antechamber walls drastically altered kinetic equilibrium properties maintain unstructured states accessible hydrolysis
