nanoscale holographic interferometry strain measurements electronic devices 
strained silicon now integral feature latest generation transistors electronic devices- associated enhancement carrier mobility strain also expected important role future devices based nanowires optoelectronic components different strategies used engineer strain devices leading complex strain distributions two three dimensions developing methods strain measurement nanoscale therefore important objective recent years proved elusive practice: none existing techniques combines necessary spatial resolution precision field view example raman spectroscopy x-ray diffraction techniques can map strain micrometre scale whereas transmission electron microscopy allows strain measurement nanometre scale small sample areas present technique capable bridging gap measuring strain high precision nanometre spatial resolution micrometre fields view method combines advantages moire techniques flexibility off-axis electron holography also applicable relatively thick samples thus reducing influence thin-film relaxation effects
