direct evidence dinuclear copper intermediate cui-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloadditions 
copperi-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition become commonly employed method synthesis complex molecular architectures challenging conditions despite widespread use copper-catalyzed cycloaddition reactions mechanism processes remained difficult establish due involvement multiple equilibria several reactive intermediates real-time monitoring representative cycloaddition process via heat-flow reaction calorimetry revealed monomeric copper acetylide complexes reactive toward organic azides unless exogenous copper catalyst added furthermore crossover experiments isotopically enriched exogenous copper source illustrated stepwise nature carbon-nitrogen bond-forming events equivalence two copper atoms within cycloaddition steps
