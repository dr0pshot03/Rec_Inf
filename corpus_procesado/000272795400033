growth landscape formed perception import glucose yeast 
important challenge systems biology quantitatively describe microbial growth using measurable parameters capture essence complex phenomenon two key events cell membrane-extracellular glucose sensing uptake-initiate budding yeasts growth glucose however conventional growth models focus almost exclusively glucose uptake present results growth-rate experiments explained focusing glucose uptake alone imposing glucose uptake rate independent sensed extracellular glucose level show despite increasing sensed glucose concentration uptake rate cells growth rate can decrease even approach zero resolve puzzle showing interaction glucose perception import individual actions determines central features growth characterize interaction using quantitative model disrupting interaction knocking two key glucose sensors significantly changes cells growth rate yet uptake rates unchanged due decrease burden glucose perception places cells work shows glucose perception import separate pivotal modules yeast growth interaction can precisely tuned measured
