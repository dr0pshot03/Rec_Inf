stage-specific control neuronal migration somatostatin 
developing neurons transiently express somatostatin receptors- little known function early stages thought endogenous somatostatin might control migratory behaviour immature neurons examined effects somatostatin cerebellar granule cells early postnatal mice cells express five types somatostatin receptors initiation migration show somatostatin opposite stage-specific effects migration cerebellar granule cells activation somatostatin receptors increases rate granule cell migration near birthplace decreases rate near final destination furthermore somatostatin enhances size frequency spontaneous ca2+ fluctuations early phase migration whereas eliminates spike-like ca2+ transients late phase somatostatin-induced changes early late phases reversed blockade k+ channel activity results indicate somatostatin may provide essential cue accelerating movement granule cells early phase terminating movement late phase altering intracellular ca2+ concentrations k+ channel activity
