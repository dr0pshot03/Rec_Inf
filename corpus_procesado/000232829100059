heterodimeric complex promotes assembly mammalian 20s proteasomes 
26s proteasome multisubunit protease responsible regulated proteolysis eukaryotic cells comprises one catalytic 20s proteasome two axially positioned 19s regulatory complexes 20s proteasome composed subunits arranged cylindrical particle four heteroheptameric rings alpha-beta-beta-alpha- refs mechanism responsible assembly complex structure remains elusive report two chaperones designated proteasome assembling chaperone pac1 pac2 involved maturation mammalian 20s proteasomes pac1 pac2 associate heterodimers proteasome precursors degraded formation 20s proteasome completed overexpression pac1 pac2 accelerates formation precursor proteasomes whereas knockdown short interfering rna impairs resulting poor maturation 20s proteasomes furthermore pac complex provides scaffold alpha-ring formation keeps alpha-rings competent subsequent formation half-proteasomes thus results identify mechanism correct assembly 20s proteasomes
