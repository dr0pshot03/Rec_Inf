tim50 maintains permeability barrier mitochondrial inner membrane 
transport metabolites across mitochondrial inner membrane highly selective thereby maintaining electrochemical proton gradient functions main driving force cellular adenosine triphosphate synthesis mitochondria import many preproteins via presequence translocase inner membrane however reconstituted tim23 protein constitutes pore remaining mainly open form state deleterious organello found intermembrane space domain tim50 induced tim23 channel close presequences overcame effect activated channel translocation thus hydrophilic cis domain tim50 maintains permeability barrier mitochondria closing translocation pore presequence-regulated manner
