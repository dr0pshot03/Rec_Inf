mesoscopic phase coherence quantum spin fluid 
mesoscopic quantum phase coherence important improves prospects handling quantum degrees freedom technology show development coherence can monitored using magnetic neutron scattering one-dimensional spin chain oxide nickel y2banio5 quantum spin fluid classical static magnetic order present cleanest samples quantum coherence length nanometers almost order magnitude larger classical antiferromagnetic correlation length nanometers also demonstrate coherence length can modified static thermally activated defects quantitatively predictable manner
