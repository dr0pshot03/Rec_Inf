inhibition hedgehog signaling enhances delivery chemotherapy mouse model pancreatic cancer 
pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma pda among lethal human cancers part insensitive many chemotherapeutic drugs studying mouse model pda refractory clinically used drug gemcitabine found tumors model poorly perfused poorly vascularized properties shared human pda tested whether delivery efficacy gemcitabine mice improved coadministration ipi- drug depletes tumor-associated stromal tissue inhibition hedgehog cellular signaling pathway combination therapy produced transient increase intratumoral vascular density intratumoral concentration gemcitabine leading transient stabilization disease thus inefficient drug delivery may important contributor chemoresistance pancreatic cancer
