magmatic gas composition reveals source depth slug-driven strombolian explosive activity 
strombolian-type eruptive activity common many volcanoes consists regular explosions driven bursting gas slugs rise faster surrounding magma explosion quakes associated activity usually localized shallow depth; however slugs actually form remain poorly constrained used spectroscopic measurements performed quiescent degassing explosions stromboli volcano italy demonstrate gas slugs originate deep volcano-crust interface similar kilometers structural discontinuities differential bubble-rise speed can promote slug coalescence observed decoupling deep slug genesis shallow similar -meter explosion quakes may common feature strombolian activity determined geometry plumbing systems
