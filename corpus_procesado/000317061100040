tissue-like printed material 
living cells communicate cooperate produce emergent properties tissues synthetic mimics cells liposomes typically incapable cooperation therefore readily display sophisticated collective behavior printed tens thousands picoliter aqueous droplets become joined single lipid bilayers form cohesive material cooperating compartments three-dimensional structures can built heterologous droplets software-defined arrangements droplet networks can functionalized membrane proteins; example allow rapid electrical communication along specific path networks can also programmed osmolarity gradients fold otherwise unattainable designed structures printed droplet networks might interfaced tissues used tissue engineering substrates developed mimics living tissue
