field evidence surface-wave-induced instability sand dunes 
field studies barchans crescent shaped dunes propagate solid ground conditions unidirectional wind long focused investigation equilibrium sand transport wind control air flow dune topography- thought control dune morphology kinematics- long timescale involved however underlying dynamic processes responsible evolution dune fields remain poorly understood combine data three-year field study moroccan sahara model study show barchans fundamentally unstable necessarily behave like stable solitary waves suggested previously- find dune collisions changes wind direction destabilize dunes generate surface waves barchans resulting surface waves propagate higher speed dunes can produce series new barchans elementary size breaking horns large dunes creation new dunes provides mechanism sand loss prevents dune fields merging single giant dune therefore plays fundamental role control size selection development dune patterns
