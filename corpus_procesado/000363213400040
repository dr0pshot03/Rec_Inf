methane metabolism archaeal phylum bathyarchaeota revealed genome-centric metagenomics
methanogenic methanotrophic archaea play important roles global flux methane culture-independent approaches providing deeper insight diversity evolution methane-metabolizing microorganisms now compelling evidence existed methane metabolism archaea outside phylum euryarchaeota performed metagenomic sequencing deep aquifer recovering two near-complete genomes belonging archaeal phylum bathyarchaeota formerly known miscellaneous crenarchaeotal group genomes contain divergent homologs genes necessary methane metabolism including encode methyl-coenzyme m reductase mcr complex additional non-euryarchaeotal mcr-encoding genes identified range environments suggest unrecognized archaeal lineages may also contribute global methane cycling findings indicate methane metabolism arose last common ancestor euryarchaeota bathyarchaeota
