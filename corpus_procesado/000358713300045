crystallization particle attachment synthetic biogenic geologic environments 
field laboratory observations show crystals commonly form addition attachment particles range multi-ion complexes fully formed nanoparticles particles involved nonclassical pathways crystallization diverse contrast classical models consider addition monomeric chemical species review progress toward understanding crystal growth particle-attachment processes show multiple pathways result interplay free-energy landscapes reaction dynamics much remains unknown fundamental aspects particularly relationships solution structure interfacial forces particle motion developing predictive description connects molecular details ensemble behavior will require revisiting long-standing interpretations crystal formation synthetic systems biominerals patterns mineralization natural environments
