comprehensive phylogeny birds aves using targeted next-generation dna sequencing 
although reconstruction phylogeny living birds progressed tremendously last decade evolutionary history neoaves-a clade encompasses nearly living bird species-remains greatest unresolved challenge dinosaur systematics investigate avian phylogeny unprecedented scale data: > bases genomic sequence data species living birds representing major avian lineages two crocodilian outgroups sequence data collected using anchored hybrid enrichment yielding nuclear loci average length bases total data set 8x10 bases bayesian maximum likelihood analyses yielded highly supported nearly identical phylogenetic trees major avian lineages five major clades form successive sister groups rest neoaves: clade including nightjars caprimulgiforms swifts hummingbirds clade uniting cuckoos bustards turacos pigeons mesites sandgrouse cranes relatives comprehensive waterbird clade including diving wading shorebirds comprehensive landbird clade enigmatic hoatzin opisthocomus hoazin sister group rest neither two main recently proposed neoavian clades-columbea passerea-were supported monophyletic results divergence time analyses congruent palaeontological record supporting major radiation crown birds wake cretaceous-palaeogene k-pg mass extinction
