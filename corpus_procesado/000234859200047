evidence stem cells reside adult drosophila midgut epithelium
adult stem cells maintain organ systems throughout course life facilitate repair injury disease fundamental property stem progenitor cell division capacity retain proliferative state generate differentiated daughter cells however little currently known signals regulate balance processes characterize proliferating cellular compartment adult drosophila midgut using genetic mosaic analysis demonstrate differentiated cells epithelium arise common lineage furthermore show reduction notch signalling leads increase number midgut progenitor cells whereas activation notch pathway leads decrease proliferation thus midgut progenitors default state proliferation inhibited notch signalling pathway ability identify manipulate genetically trace cell lineages midgut lead discovery additional genes regulate stem progenitor cell biology gastrointestinal tract
