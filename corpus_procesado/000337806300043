chirality-specific growth single-walled carbon nanotubes solid alloy catalysts
carbon nanotubes many material properties make attractive applications context nanoelectronics interest focused single-walled carbon nanotubes swnts slight changes tube diameter wrapping angle defined chirality indices nm will shift electrical conductivity one characteristic metallic state one characteristic semiconducting state will also change bandgap however structure-function relationship can fully exploited structurally pure swnts solution-based separation methods yield tubes within narrow structure range ultimate goal producing just one type swnt controlling structure growth proved considerable challenge last two decades- efforts aim optimize composition- shape- catalyst particles used chemical vapour deposition synthesis process decompose carbon feedstock influence swnt nucleation growth- approach resulted highest reported proportion per cent single-chirality swnts as-grown sample show swnts single chirality can produced directly abundance higher per cent using tungsten-based bimetallic alloy nanocrystals catalysts unlike catalysts used far high melting points maintain crystalline structure chemical vapour deposition process feature seems crucial experiment simulation suggest highly selective growth swnts result good structural match carbon atom arrangement around nanotube circumference arrangement catalytically active atoms one planes nanocrystal catalyst anticipate using high-melting-point alloy nanocrystals optimized structures catalysts paves way total chirality control swnt growth will thus promote development swnt applications
