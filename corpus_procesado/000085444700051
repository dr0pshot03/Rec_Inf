neuroimaging evidence dissociable forms repetition priming
repetition priming characterized neurophysiologically decreased response following stimulus repetition present study used event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging investigate whether repetition-related response sensitive stimulus familiarity right fusiform region exhibited attenuated response repetition familiar stimuli faces symbols exhibited enhanced response repetition unfamiliar stimuli moreover repetition effects modulated lag successive presentations experiments replicated interactions repetition familiarity lag demonstrated persistence effects multiple repetitions priming-related responses therefore unitary depend presence absence preexisting stimulus representations
