actin dynamics contractile ring cytokinesis fission yeast 
cytokinesis many eukaryotes requires contractile ring actin myosin cleaves cell two little known actin filaments components assemble ring structure generate force12 show contractile ring fission yeast schizosaccharomyces pombe active site actin assembly actin polymerization activity requires arp3 formin cdc12 profilin wasp myosin ii iqgap proteins newly polymerized actin filaments pre-existing actin cables can contribute initial assembly ring formed ring remains dynamic structure actin ring components continuously assemble disassemble ring every minute rate actin polymerization can influence rate cleavage thus actin polymerization driven arp2/ complex formins central process cytokinesis studies show cytokinesis dynamic process previously thought provide perspective mechanism cell division
