structures anomalous diffraction native biological macromolecules 
crystal structure analyses biological macromolecules without known structural relatives entail solving crystallographic phase problem typical de novo phase evaluations depend incorporating heavier atoms found natively commonly multi single-wavelength anomalous diffraction mad sad experiments exploit selenomethionyl proteins realize routine structure determination using intrinsic anomalous scattering native macromolecules devised robust procedures enhancing signal-to-noise ratio slight anomalous scattering generic native structures combining data measured multiple crystals lower-than-usual x-ray energy using multicrystal sad method equivalent crystals determined structures modest resolution angstroms native proteins varying size unique residues number sulfur sites requirement heavy-atom incorporation experiments provide attractive alternative selenomethionyl sad experiments
