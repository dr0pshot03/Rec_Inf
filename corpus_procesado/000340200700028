formation monatomic metallic glasses ultrafast liquid quenching 
long conjectured metallic liquid can vitrified glassy state provided cooling rate sufficiently high- experimentally however vitrification single-element metallic liquids notoriously difficult true laboratory demonstration formation monatomic metallic glass lacking report experimental approach vitrification monatomic metallic liquids achieving unprecedentedly high liquid-quenching rate ks- high cooling rate melts pure refractory body-centred cubic bcc metals liquid tantalum vanadium successfully vitrified form metallic glasses suitable property interrogations combining situ transmission electron microscopy observation atoms-to-continuum modelling investigated formation condition thermal stability monatomic metallic glasses obtained availability monatomic metallic glasses simplest glass formers offers unique possibilities studying structure property relationships glasses technique also shows great control reversible vitrification-crystallization processes suggesting potential micro-electromechanical applications ultrahigh cooling rate approaching highest liquid-quenching rate attainable experiment makes possible explore fast kinetics structural behaviour supercooled metallic liquids within nanosecond picosecond regimes
