switched magnetospheric regulation pulsar spin-down 
pulsars famed rotational clocklike stability highly repeatable pulse shapes however long known unexplained deviations often termed timing noise rate predict clocks run show timing behavior often results two different spin-down rates pulsars switch abruptly states often quasi-periodically leading observed spin-down patterns show six pulsars timing noise correlated changes pulse shape many pulsar phenomena including mode changing nulling intermittency pulse-shape variability timing noise therefore linked caused changes pulsars magnetosphere consider possibility high-precision monitoring pulse profiles lead formation highly stable pulsar clocks
