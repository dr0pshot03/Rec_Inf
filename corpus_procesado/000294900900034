focused evolution hiv neutralizing antibodies revealed structures deep sequencing
antibody vrc01 human immunoglobulin neutralizes % hiv isolates understand broadly neutralizing antibodies develop used x-ray crystallography pyrosequencing characterize additional vrc01-like antibodies hiv--infected individuals crystal structures revealed convergent mode binding diverse antibodies cd4-binding-site epitope functional genomics analysis expressed heavy light chains revealed common pathways antibody-heavy chain maturation confined ighv1-* lineage involving dozens somatic changes capable pairing different light chains broadly neutralizing hiv immunity associated vrc01-like antibodies thus involves evolution antibodies highly affinity-matured state required recognize invariant viral structure lineages defined thousands sequences providing genetic roadmap development
