p63+krt5+ distal airway stem cells essential lung regeneration
lung diseases chronic obstructive pulmonary disease pulmonary fibrosis involve progressive inexorable destruction oxygen exchange surfaces airways emerged leading cause death worldwide mitigating therapies aside impractical organ transplantation remain limited possibility regenerative medicine lacked empirical support however clinically known patients survive sudden massive loss lung tissue necrotizing pneumonia acute respiratory distress syndrome often recover full pulmonary function within six months correspondingly recently demonstrated lung regeneration mice following h1n1 influenza virus infection linked distal airway stem cells expressing trp63 p63 keratin called dascp63/krt5 process show pre-existing intrinsically committed dascp63/krt5 undergo proliferative expansion response influenza-induced lung damage assemble nascent alveoli sites interstitial lung inflammation also show selective ablation dascp63/krt5 vivo prevents regeneration leading pre-fibrotic lesions deficient oxygen exchange finally demonstrate single dascp63/krt5-derived pedigrees differentiate type type ii pneumocytes well bronchiolar secretory cells following transplantation infected lung also minimize structural consequences endogenous stem cell loss process ability propagate cells culture maintaining intrinsic lineage commitment suggests potential stem cell-based therapies acute chronic lung diseases
