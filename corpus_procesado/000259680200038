time reversal negative refraction 
time reversal negative refraction shown intimately linked processes propose scheme exploits transitions positive negative frequencies mimic negative refraction interface hence make negatively refracting lens theory applies equally electromagnetic acoustic waves also propose experimental realization ideal circumstances lens can exhibit subwavelength resolution limited strength time reversed signal
