tristable nematic liquid-crystal device using micropatterned surface alignment 
long appreciated liquid-crystal lc devices lc molecules adopt multiple stable orientations drastically reduce power consumption required high-information-content displays commonly used nematic lcs intrinsically uniaxial symmetry industrially feasible multi-stable lc device realized1- recently demonstrated bistability can robustly engineered nematic lc device patterning substrate orientational chequerboard pattern enforces orthogonal lc alignment neighbouring square domains89 result four-fold symmetry pattern two diagonal axes chequerboard become equally stable macroscopic orientations extend symmetry approach obtain tristable surface-aligned nematic lc microscopic pattern exhibiting six-fold symmetry inscribed polyimide surface using stylus atomic force microscope hexagonal symmetry microscopic orientational domains turn gives rise three stable macroscopic lc orientations mutually switchable in-plane electric field resulting switching mode surface driven hence compatible demanding flexible display applications
