piezo2 required merkel-cell mechanotransduction 
sense touch remains fundamentally unknown merkel cell-neurite complex gentle touch receptor skin mediates slowly adapting responses beta sensory fibres encode fine details objects- mechanoreceptor complex recognized essential role sensing gentle touch nearly years ago however whether merkel cells afferent fibres sense mechanical force still debated molecular mechanism mechanotransduction unknown- synapse-like junctions observed merkel cells associated afferents- yet unclear whether merkel cells inherently mechanosensitive whether can rapidly transmit information neighbouring nerve show merkel cells produce touch-sensitive currents vitro piezo2 mechanically activated cation channel expressed merkel cells engineered mice deficient piezo2 skin sensory neurons show merkel-cell mechanosensitivity completely depends piezo2 mice slowly adapting responses vivo mediated merkel cell-neurite complex show reduced static firing rates moreover mice display moderately decreased behavioural responses gentle touch results indicate piezo2 merkel-cell mechanotransduction channel provide first line evidence piezo channels physiological role mechanosensation mammals furthermore data present evidence two-receptor-site model merkel cells innervating afferents act together mechanosensors two-receptor system provide mechanoreceptor complex tuning mechanism achieve highly sophisticated responses given mechanical stimulus
