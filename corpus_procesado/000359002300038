genetic diversity evolutionary dynamics ebola virus sierra leone 
novel ebola virus ebov first identified march infected people west africa resulting deaths preliminary analyses genome sequences ebov collected march june guinea sierra leone suggest ebov originated independent transmission event natural reservoir followed sustained human-to-human infections reported ebov genome variation might effect efficacy sequence-based virus detection candidate therapeutics however limited viral information available since july outbreak entered rapid growth phase describe full-length ebov genome sequences five severely stricken districts sierra leone september november found ebov become phylogenetically genetically diverse july november characterized emergence multiple novel lineages substitution rate ebov estimated 23x10- substitutions per site per year % highest posterior density interval 04x10- 41x10- substitutions per site per year approximating observed previous ebov outbreaks sharp increase genetic diversity ebov warrants extensive ebov surveillance sierra leone guinea liberia better understand viral evolution transmission dynamics ongoing outbreak data will facilitate international efforts develop vaccines therapeutics
