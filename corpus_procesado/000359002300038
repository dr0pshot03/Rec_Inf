novel ebola virus ebov first identified march infected people west africa resulting deaths12 preliminary analyses genome sequences ebov collected march june guinea sierra leone suggest ebov originated independent transmission event natural reservoir3 followed sustained human-to-human infections4 reported ebov genome variation might effect efficacy sequence-based virus detection candidate therapeutics56 however limited viral information available since july outbreak entered rapid growth phase7 describe full-length ebov genome sequences five severely stricken districts sierra leone september november found ebov become phylogenetically genetically diverse july november characterized emergence multiple novel lineages substitution rate ebov estimated 123x10- substitutions per site per year % highest posterior density interval 104x10- 141x10- substitutions per site per year approximating observed previous ebov outbreaks sharp increase genetic diversity ebov warrants extensive ebov surveillance sierra leone guinea liberia better understand viral evolution transmission dynamics ongoing outbreak data will facilitate international efforts develop vaccines therapeutics
