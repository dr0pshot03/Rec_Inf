computational design ligand-binding proteins high affinity selectivity 
ability design proteins high affinity selectivity given small molecule rigorous test understanding physiochemical principles govern molecular recognition attempts rationally design ligand-binding proteins met little success however computational design protein-small-molecule interfaces remains unsolved problem current approaches designing ligand-binding proteins medical biotechnological uses rely raising antibodies target antigen immunized animals and/or performing laboratory-directed evolution proteins existing low affinity desired ligand- neither allows complete control interactions involved binding describe general computational method designing pre-organized shape complementary small-molecule-binding sites use generate protein binders steroid digoxigenin dig seventeen experimentally characterized designs two bind dig model higher affinity binder energetically favourable pre-organized interface design set comprehensive binding-fitness landscape design generated library selections deep sequencing used optimize binding affinity picomolar level x-ray co-crystal structures two variants show atomic-level agreement corresponding computational models optimized binder selective dig related steroids digitoxigenin progesterone beta-oestradiol steroid binding preference can reprogrammed manipulation explicitly designed hydrogen-bonding interactions computational design method presented enable development new generation biosensors therapeutics diagnostics
