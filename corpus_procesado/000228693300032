reduced sleep drosophila shaker mutants
us sleep h per night deprived sleep performance suffers greatly however well just h sleep-a trait seems run families determining genes underlie phenotype shed light mechanisms functions sleep performed mutagenesis drosophila melanogaster flies also sleep many hours sleep deprived show sleep rebound performance impairments screening mutant lines found minisleep mns line sleeps one-third wild-type amount show mns flies perform normally number tasks preserved sleep homeostasis impaired sleep deprivation show mns flies carry point mutation conserved domain shaker gene moreover crossing genetic modifiers accumulated many generations shaker alleles also become short sleepers fail complement mns phenotype finally show short-sleeping shaker flies reduced lifespan shaker encodes voltage-dependent potassium channel controlling membrane repolarization transmitter release may thus regulate sleep need efficiency
