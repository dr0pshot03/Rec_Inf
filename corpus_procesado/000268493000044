grain boundary defect elimination zeolite membrane rapid thermal processing
microporous molecular sieve catalysts adsorbents discriminate molecules basis size shape interest molecular sieve films stems potential energy-efficient membrane separations however grain boundary defects formed response stresses induced heat treatment compromise selectivity creating nonselective transport pathways permeating molecules show rapid thermal processing can improve separation performance thick columnar films certain zeolite silicalite- eliminating grain boundary defects possibly strengthening grain bonding grain boundaries methodology enables preparation silicalite membranes high separation performance aromatic linear versus branched hydrocarbon isomers holds promise realizing high-throughput scalable production zeolite membranes improved energy efficiency
