fat metabolism links germline stem cells longevity c elegans
fat metabolism reproduction aging intertwined regulatory axes however mechanism coupled remains poorly understood found germline stem cells gscs actively modulate lipid hydrolysis caenorhabditis elegans turn regulates longevity gsc arrest promotes systemic lipolysis via induction specific fat lipase subsequently fat mobilization promoted life span prolonged constitutive expression lipase fat storage tissue generates lean long lived animals lipase key factor lipid hydrolysis increased longevity induced decreased insulin signaling results suggest link c elegans fat metabolism longevity
