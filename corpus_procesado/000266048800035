direct detection abortive rna transcripts vivo 
transcription initiation vitro prokaryotic eukaryotic rna polymerase rnap can engage abortive initiation-the synthesis release short nucleotides rna transcripts-before productive initiation known whether abortive initiation occurs vivo using hybridization locked nucleic acid probes directly detected abortive transcripts bacteria addition show vivo abortive initiation shows characteristics vitro abortive initiation: abortive initiation increases upon stabilizing interactions rnap either promoter dna sigma factor also upon deleting elongation factor grea abortive transcripts may functional roles regulating gene expression vivo
