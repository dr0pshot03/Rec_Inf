species response environmental change: impacts food web interactions evolution 
environmental change affects species abundances depends food web within species interact potential evolve using field experiments investigated ecological evolutionary responses pea aphids acyrthosiphon pisum common agricultural pest increased frequency episodic heat shocks one predator species ameliorated decrease aphid population growth increasing heat shocks whereas second predator contrast caused behavioral differences predators also compared aphid strains stably inherited differences heat tolerance caused bacterial endosymbionts showed potential rapid evolution heat-shock tolerance results illustrate ecological evolutionary complexities incorporated predictions consequences environmental change species populations
