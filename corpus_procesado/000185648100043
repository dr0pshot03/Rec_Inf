temperature excludes n--fixing heterocystous cyanobacteria tropical oceans
whereas non-heterocystous cyanobacteria trichodesmium spp dominant n--fixing organisms tropical oceans heterocystous species dominate n fixation freshwater lakes brackish environments baltic sea far satisfactory explanation absence heterocystous cyanobacteria pelagic tropical oceans given even though heterocysts seem represent ideal strategy protecting nitrogenase inactivated o- thereby enabling cyanobacteria fix n perform photosynthesis simultaneously trichodesmium capable n fixation apparently without needing differentiate heterocysts show differences temperature dependence o flux respiration n fixation activity explain trichodesmium performs better heterocystous species higher temperatures results also explain trichodesmium successful temperate cold seas absence heterocystous cyanobacteria pelagic zone temperate cold seas however requires another explanation
