early mesodermal cues assign avian cardiac pacemaker fate potential tertiary heart field
cardiac pacemaker cells autonomously generate electrical impulses initiate maintain rhythmic contraction heart although majority heart cells thought originate primary secondary heart fields found chick pacemaker cells arise discrete region mesoderm outside fields shortly gastrulation canonical wnts promote recruitment mesodermal cells within region pacemaker lineage findings suggest cardiac pacemaker cells physically segregated molecularly programmed tertiary heart field prior onset cardiac morphogenesis
