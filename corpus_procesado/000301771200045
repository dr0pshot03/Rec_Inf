idh mutation impairs histone demethylation results block cell differentiation 
recurrent mutations isocitrate dehydrogenase idh1 idh2 identified gliomas acute myeloid leukaemias aml chondrosarcomas share novel enzymatic property producing -hydroxyglutarate 2hg alpha-ketoglutarate1- report 2hg-producing idh mutants can prevent histone demethylation required lineage-specific progenitor cells differentiate terminally differentiated cells tumour samples glioma patients idh mutations associated distinct gene expression profile enriched genes expressed neural progenitor cells associated increased histone methylation test whether ability idh mutants promote histone methylation contributes block cell differentiation non-transformed cells tested effect neomorphic idh mutants adipocyte differentiation vitro introduction either mutant idh cell-permeable 2hg associated repression inducible expression lineage-specific differentiation genes block differentiation correlated significant increase repressive histone methylation marks without observable changes promoter dna methylation gliomas found elevated levels similar histone repressive marks stable transfection 2hg-producing mutant idh immortalized astrocytes resulted progressive accumulation histone methylation marks examined increased h3k9 methylation reproducibly preceded rise dna methylation cells passaged culture furthermore found 2hg-inhibitable h3k9 demethylase kdm4c induced adipocyte differentiation rna-interference suppression kdm4c sufficient block differentiation together data demonstrate 2hg can inhibit histone demethylation inhibition histone demethylation can sufficient block differentiation non-transformed cells
