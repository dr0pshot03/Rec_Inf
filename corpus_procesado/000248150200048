host immune system gene targeting viral mirna 
virally encoded micrornas mirnas recently discovered herpesviruses however biological roles mostly unknown developed algorithm prediction mirna targets applied human cytomegalovirus mirnas resulting identification major histocompatibility complex class i-related chain b micb gene top candidate target hcmv-mir-ul112 micb stress-induced ligand natural killer nk cell activating receptor nkg2d critical nk cell killing virus-infected cells tumor cells show hcmv-mir-ul112 specifically down-regulates micb expression viral infection leading decreased binding nkg2d reduced killing nk cells results reveal mirna-based immunoevasion mechanism appears exploited human cytomegalovirus
