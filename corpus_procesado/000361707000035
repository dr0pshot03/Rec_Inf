somatic mutation cancer normal cells
spontaneously occurring mutations accumulate somatic cells throughout persons lifetime majority mutations noticeable effect can alter key cellular functions early somatic mutations can cause developmental disorders whereas progressive accumulation mutations throughout life can lead cancer contribute aging genome sequencing revolutionized understanding somatic mutation cancer providing detailed view mutational processes genes drive cancer yet fundamental gaps remain knowledge normal cells evolve cancer cells briefly summarize number lessons learned years cancer genome sequencing discuss implications understanding cancer progression aging
