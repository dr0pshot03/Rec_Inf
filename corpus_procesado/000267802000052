hematopoietic cytokines can instruct lineage choice 
constant regeneration blood system hematopoiesis requires tightly controlled lineage decisions hematopoietic progenitor cells hpcs technical limitations differentiation individual hpcs previously analyzed continuously therefore disputed whether cell-extrinsic cytokines can instruct hpc lineage choice allow survival cells already lineage-restricted used bioimaging approaches allow continuous long-term observation individual differentiating mouse hpcs demonstrate physiological cytokines macrophage colony-stimulating factor granulocyte colony-stimulating factor can instruct hematopoietic lineage choice
