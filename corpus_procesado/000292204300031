genomic island variability facilitates prochlorococcus-virus coexistence 
prochlorococcus cyanobacteria extremely abundant oceans viruses infect hosts viruses coexist nature remains unclear although presence susceptible resistant cells may allow coexistence combined whole-genome sequencing pcr screening technology now enables us investigate effect resistance genome evolution genomic mechanisms behind long-term coexistence prochlorococcus viruses present genome analysis substrains selected resistance ten viruses revealing mutations primarily non-conserved horizontally transferred genes localize single hypervariable genomic island mutations affected viral attachment cell surface imposed fitness cost host manifested significantly lower growth rates previously unknown mechanism rapid infection viruses mutant genes generally uncommon nature yet carry polymorphisms matching found experimentally data empirical evidence indicating viral-attachment genes preferentially located genomic islands viruses selective pressure enhancing diversity island genes island gene content diversity emerges genomic mechanism reduces effective host population size infection given virus thus facilitating long-term coexistence viruses hosts nature
