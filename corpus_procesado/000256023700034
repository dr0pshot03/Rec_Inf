proteasome subunit rpn13 novel ubiquitin receptor 
proteasomal receptors recognize ubiquitin chains attached substrates key mediators selective protein degradation eukaryotes report identification new ubiquitin receptor rpn13/arm1 known component proteasome rpn13 binds ubiquitin conserved amino-terminal region termed pleckstrin-like receptor ubiquitin pru domain binds k48-linked diubiquitin affinity approximately nm like proteasomal ubiquitin receptor rpn10/s5a rpn13 also binds ubiquitin-like ubl domains ubl ubiquitin associated uba proteins yeast synthetic phenotype results specific mutations ubiquitin binding sites rpn10 rpn13 combined indicating functional linkage ubiquitin receptors rpn13 also proteasomal receptor uch37 deubiquitinating enzyme findings suggest coupling chain recognition disassembly proteasome
