shapes vorticities superfluid helium nanodroplets 
helium nanodroplets considered ideal model systems explore quantum hydrodynamics self-contained isolated superfluids however exploring dynamic properties individual droplets experimentally challenging work used single-shot femtosecond x-ray coherent diffractive imaging investigate rotation single isolated superfluid helium droplets containing similar atoms formation quantum vortex lattices inside droplets confirmed observing characteristic bragg patterns xenon clusters trapped vortex cores vortex densities five orders magnitude larger observed bulk liquid helium droplets exhibit large centrifugal deformations retain axially symmetric shapes angular velocities well beyond stability range viscous classical droplets
