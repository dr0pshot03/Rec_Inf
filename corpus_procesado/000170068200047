buffer effect large-scale population regulation migratory birds
buffer effects occur sites vary quality fluctuations population size mirrored large changes animal numbers poor-quality sites small changes good-quality sites hence poor sites `buffer good sites mechanism can potentially drive population regulation demographic costs inhabiting poor sites show migratory bird process can apply country-wide scale consequences survival timing arrival breeding grounds indicator reproductive success icelandic population black-tailed godwit limosa limosa islandica wintering britain increased fourfold since 1970s ref rates change within individual estuaries varied zero sixfold increases accordance buffer effect rates increase greater estuaries low initial numbers godwits sites lower prey-intake rates lower survival rates arrive later iceland godwits sites stable populations buffer effect can therefore major process influencing large-scale population regulation migratory species
