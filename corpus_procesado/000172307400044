two essential dna polymerases bacterial replication fork
dna replication bacteria carried multiprotein complex thought contain one essential dna polymerase specified dhae gene escherichia coli polc gene bacillus subtilis bacillus subtilis genome analysis revealed another dna polymerase gene dnaebs homologous dnae show b subtilis dnaebs essential cell viability elongation step dna replication polc conclude two different essential dna polymerases replication fork b subtilis previously observed eukaryotes dnaebs appears involved synthesis tagging dna strand associated replication factory suggests two different polymerases carry synthesis two dna strands b subtilis many bacteria contain polc dnae genes
