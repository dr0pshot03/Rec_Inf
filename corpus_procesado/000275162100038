hippocampal short long-term plasticity modulated astrocyte ca2+ signaling 
concept astrocytes release neuroactive molecules gliotransmitters affect synaptic transmission paradigm shift neuroscience research past decade concept suggests astrocytes together pre postsynaptic neuronal elements make functional synapse astrocyte release gliotransmitters example glutamate adenosine triphosphate generally accepted ca2+-dependent process used two mouse lines either selectively increase obliterate astrocytic gq g protein-coupled receptor ca2+ signaling test hypothesis astrocytes release gliotransmitters ca2+-dependent manner affect synaptic transmission neither increasing obliterating astrocytic ca2+ fluxes affects spontaneous evoked excitatory synaptic transmission synaptic plasticity findings suggest least hippocampus mechanisms gliotransmission need reconsidered
