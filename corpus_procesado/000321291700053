inhibition rna helicase brr2 c-terminal tail spliceosomal protein prp8 
ski2-like rna helicase brr2 core component spliceosome must tightly regulated ensure correct timing spliceosome activation little known mechanisms regulation ski2-like helicases protein cofactors show crystal structure biochemical analyses prp8 protein major regulator spliceosome can insert c-terminal tail brr2s rna-binding tunnel thereby intermittently blocking brr2s rna-binding adenosine triphosphatase u4/u6 unwinding activities inefficient brr2 repression recognizable phenotype associated certain retinitis pigmentosa-linked prp8 mutations map c-terminal tail data show ski2-like rna helicase can reversibly inhibited protein cofactor directly competes rna substrate binding
