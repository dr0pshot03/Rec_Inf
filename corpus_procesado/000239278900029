scaling design miniaturized chemical-analysis systems
micrometre-scale analytical devices attractive macroscale counterparts various reasons example use smaller volumes reagents therefore cheaper quicker less hazardous use environmentally appealing scaling laws compare relative performance system dimensions system change can predict operational success miniaturized chemical separation reaction detection devices fabricated devices designed using basic principles scaling now commercially available opportunities miniaturizing new challenging analytical systems continue arise
