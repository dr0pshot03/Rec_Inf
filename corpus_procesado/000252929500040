rates atmospheric deposition biologically active nitrogen n two seven times pre industrial rates many developed nations combustion fossil fuels agricultural fertilization expected increase similarly next years industrializing nations asia south america although environmental impacts high rates nitrogen addition well studied- lower chronic rates characterize much globe present results first multi decadal experiment examine impacts chronic experimental nitrogen addition low kg n ha- yr- ambient atmospheric nitrogen deposition kg n ha- yr- site total input rate comparable terrestrial nitrogen deposition many industrialized nations found chronic low level nitrogen addition rate reduced plant species numbers % relative controls receiving ambient n deposition moreover species numbers reduced per unit added nitrogen lower addition rates suggesting chronic low level nitrogen deposition may greater impact diversity previously thought second experiment showed decade cessation nitrogen addition relative plant species number although species abundances recovered demonstrating effects nitrogen addition reversible
