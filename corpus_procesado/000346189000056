coherent changes southeastern equatorial northern african rainfall last deglaciation 
last deglaciation wetter conditions developed abruptly similar years ago southeastern equatorial northern africa continued holocene explaining abrupt onset hemispheric coherence early african humid period challenging due opposing seasonal insolation patterns work use transient simulation climate model provides mechanistic understanding deglacial tropical african precipitation changes results show meltwater-induced reduction atlantic meridional overturning circulation amoc early deglaciation suppressed precipitation regions amoc reestablished wetter conditions developed north equator response high summer insolation increasing greenhouse gas ghg concentrations whereas wetter conditions south equator response primarily ghg increase
