odorant receptors instruct functional circuitry mouse olfactory bulb 
mammalian olfactory system detects discriminates thousands odorants using many different receptors expressed sensory neurons nasal epithelium axonal projections neurons main olfactory bulbs form reproducible patterns glomeruli two widely separated regions bulb creating two mirror-symmetric maps odorant receptor projections investigate whether odorant receptors organize neural circuitry olfactory bulb examined genetically modified mouse line ri7 -> m71 functionally characterized receptor ri7 substituted m71 receptor locus show despite ectopic location resulting glomeruli responsive known ligands ri7 receptor attract postsynaptic innervation mitral/tufted cell dendrites endow cells responses characteristic ri7 receptor external tufted cells receiving input ri7 -> m71 glomeruli form precise intrabulbar projections link medial lateral ri7 -> m71 glomeruli anatomically thus providing substrate coordinating isofunctional glomeruli conclude odorant receptor identity epithelial neurons determines glomerular convergence function also functional circuitry olfactory bulb
