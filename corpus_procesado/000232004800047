variations earthquake-size distribution across different stress regimes 
earthquake size distribution follows instances power law slope power law b value commonly used describe relative occurrence large small events high b value indicates larger proportion small earthquakes vice versa statistically significant variations b values measured laboratory experiments mines various tectonic regimes subducting slabs near magma chambers along fault zones aftershock zones however remained uncertain whether differences due differing stress regimes questionable samples small volumes laboratory specimens mines shallow earths crust representative earthquakes general given lack physical understanding differences observation b values approach constant large volumes sampled interpreted indicate b universal constant earthquakes general show b value varies systematically different styles faulting find normal faulting events highest b values thrust events lowest strike slip events intermediate values given thrust faults tend higher stress normal faults infer b value acts stress meter depends inversely differential stress
