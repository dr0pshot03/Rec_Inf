evidence prion hypothesis: induction yeast [psi+] factor vitro-converted sup35 protein 
starting purified bacterially produced protein created [psi+]-inducing agent based altered prion conformation yeast sup35 protein converting sup35p prion conformation vitro introduced cytoplasm living yeast using liposome transformation protocol introduction substoichiometric quantities converted sup35p greatly increased rate appearance well-characterized epigenetic factor [psi+] results self-propagating aggregates cellular sup35p thus predicted prion hypothesis proteins can act infectious agents causing self-propagating conformational changes
