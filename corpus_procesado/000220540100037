superconductivity diamond 
diamond electrical insulator well known exceptional hardness also conducts heat even effectively copper can withstand high electric fields1 physical properties diamond attractive electronic applications2 particularly charge carriers introduced chemical doping system boron one less electron carbon small atomic radius boron relatively easily incorporated diamond3; boron acts charge acceptor resulting diamond effectively hole-doped report discovery superconductivity boron-doped diamond synthesized high pressure nearly atmospheres temperature - k electrical resistivity magnetic susceptibility specific heat field-dependent resistance measurements show boron-doped diamond bulk type-ii superconductor superconducting transition temperature tcapproximate to4 k; superconductivity survives magnetic field h-c20greater equal to35 t discovery superconductivity diamond-structured carbon suggests si ge also form diamond structure may similarly exhibit superconductivity appropriate conditions
