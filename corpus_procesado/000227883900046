human symbionts use host-like pathway surface fucosylation
mammalian intestine harbors beneficial microbiota numbering approximately organisms per gram colonic content host tolerates tremendous bacterial load maintaining ability efficiently respond pathogenic organisms study show bacteroides use mammalian-like pathway decorate numerous surface capsular polysaccharides glycoproteins l-fucose abundant surface molecule intestinal epithelial cells resulting coordinated expression surface molecule host symbiont bacteroides mutant deficient ability cover surface l-fucose defective colonizing mammalian intestine competitive conditions
