structural basis effector control redox partner recognition cytochrome p450
cytochromes p450 catalyze variety monooxygenase reactions require electron transfer redox partners although structure many p450s small handful redox partners known little structural information available redox complexes thus leaving gap understanding control p450-redox partner interactions solved crystal structure oxidized reduced p450cam complexed redox partner putidaredoxin pdx angstroms respectively anticipated pdx favor closed substrate-bound p450cam differs substantially open conformer instead found pdx favors open state new structures indicate effector role pdx shift p450cam toward open conformation enables establishment water-mediated h-bonded network required proton-coupled electron transfer
