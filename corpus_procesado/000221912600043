myosin-dependent junction remodelling controls planar cell intercalation axis elongation
shaping developing organ embryo relies spatial regulation cell division shape however morphogenesis also occurs changes cell-neighbourhood relationships produced intercalation intercalation poses special problem epithelia adherens junctions maintain integrity tissue address mechanism ordered process cell intercalation directs polarized epithelial morphogenesis germ-band elongation developmental elongation drosophila embryo intercalation progresses junctions spatially reorganized plane epithelium following ordered pattern disassembly reassembly planar remodelling junctions driven external forces tissue boundaries depends local forces cell boundaries myosin ii specifically enriched disassembling junctions planar polarized localization activity required planar junction remodelling cell intercalation simple cellular mechanism provides general model polarized morphogenesis epithelial organs
