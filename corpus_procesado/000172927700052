"heavy electron" photoelectron spectroscopy: rotationally resolved ion pair imaging ch3+ 
applied velocity map imaging technique high-resolution conditions study ion pair products vacuum ultraviolet photodissociation methyl chloride obtained rotationally resolved kinetic energy release spectra directly provide vibrational frequencies rotational constants fundamental carbocation ch3+ technique analogous photoelectron spectroscopy chloride anion playing rote "heavy electron" approach shows promise general probe ionic species amenable study traditional methods
