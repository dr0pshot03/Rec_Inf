all-silicon passive optical diode
passive optical diode effect useful on-chip optical information processing difficult achieve using method based optical nonlinearity demonstrate forward-backward transmission ratio decibels within telecommunication wavelengths device uses two silicon rings micrometers radius passive yet maintains optical nonreciprocity broad range input power levels performs equally well even backward input power higher forward input silicon optical diode ultracompact compatible current complementary metal-oxide semiconductor processing
