robust tunable biological oscillations interlinked positive negative feedback loops 
simple negative feedback loop interacting genes proteins potential generate sustained oscillations however many biological oscillators also positive feedback loop raising question advantages extra loop imparts computational studies show generally difficult adjust negative feedback oscillators frequency without compromising amplitude whereas positive plus negative feedback one can achieve widely tunable frequency near constant amplitude tunability makes latter design suitable biological rhythms like heartbeats cell cycles need provide constant output range frequencies positive plus negative oscillators also appear robust easier evolve rationalizing found contexts adjustable frequency unimportant
