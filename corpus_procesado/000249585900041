universality classes domain wall motion ferromagnetic semiconductor ga mnas
magnetic domain wall motion induced magnetic fields spin-polarized electrical currents experimentally well established full understanding underlying mechanisms however remains elusive ferromagnetic semiconductor ga mnas measured compared motions thermally activated subthreshold creep regime velocity obeys arrhenius scaling law within law clearly different exponents current field reflect different universality classes showing drive mechanisms fundamentally different
