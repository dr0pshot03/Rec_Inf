high-frequency scaled graphene transistors diamond-like carbon
owing high carrier mobility saturation velocity graphene attracted enormous attention recent years- particular high-performance graphene transistors radio-frequency rf applications great interest- synthesis large-scale graphene sheets high quality low cost demonstrated using chemical vapour deposition cvd methods however studies performed scaling behaviour transistors made cvd graphene rf applications hold great potential commercialization report systematic study top-gated cvd-graphene rf transistors gate lengths scaled nm shortest gate length demonstrated graphene rf devices cvd graphene grown copper film transferred wafer diamond-like carbon cut-off frequencies high ghz obtained nm transistors cut-off frequency found scale /gate length furthermore studied graphene rf transistors cryogenic temperatures unlike conventional semiconductor devices low-temperature performance hampered carrier freeze-out effects rf performance graphene devices exhibits little temperature dependence k providing much larger operation window available conventional devices
