evolutionary diversification ttx-resistant sodium channels predator-prey interaction 
understanding molecular genetic basis adaptations provides incomparable insight genetic mechanisms evolutionary diversification takes place whether evolution common traits different lineages proceeds similar unique mutations degree phenotypic evolution controlled changes gene regulation opposed gene function fundamental questions evolutionary biology require understanding genetic mechanisms- identify novel changes molecular structure sodium channel expressed snake skeletal muscle tsnav responsible differences tetrodotoxin ttx resistance among garter snake populations coevolving toxic newts functional expression tsnav show differences amino-acid sequence channel affect ttx binding impart different levels resistance four snake populations results indicate evolution physiological trait occurred series unique functional changes gene otherwise highly conserved among vertebrates
