systems approach mapping dna damage response pathways
failure cells respond dna damage primary event associated mutagenesis environmental toxicity map transcriptional network controlling damage response measured genomewide binding locations damage-related transcription factors tfs exposure yeast methyl-methanesulfonate mms resulting tf-target interactions revealed extensive changes pattern promoter binding identified damage-specific binding motifs systematic functional validation identified interactions target changed expression wild-type cells response mms nonresponsive cells lacking tf validated interactions assembled causal pathway models provide global hypotheses signaling transcription phenotype integrated damage
