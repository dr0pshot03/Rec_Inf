debris disk around isolated young neutron star 
pulsars rotating magnetized neutron stars born supernova explosions following collapse cores massive stars explosion ejecta fails escape may fall back onto neutron star1 may possess sufficient angular momentum form disk2 fallback general prediction current supernova models3 material pushes neutron star stability limit possible mode black hole formation4 fallback disks dramatically affect early evolution pulsars25 yet observational constraints whether significant fallback occurs even actual existence disks report discovery mid-infrared emission cool disk around isolated young x-ray pulsar disk power pulsars x-ray emission passively illuminated x-rays estimated mass disk order earth masses lifetime > years significantly exceeds spin-down age pulsar supporting supernova fallback origin disk resembles protoplanetary disks seen around ordinary young stars6 suggesting possibility planet formation around young neutron stars
