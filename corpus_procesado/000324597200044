nonlegumes respond rhizobial nod factors suppressing innate immune response 
virtually since discovery nitrogen-fixing rhizobium-legume symbioses researchers dreamed transferring capability nonlegume crop species example corn general nonlegumes assumed lack ability respond rhizobial lipo-chitin nod factors essential signal molecules trigger legume nodulation however data indicate arabidopsis thaliana plants well nonlegumes recognize rhizobial nod factor via mechanism results strong suppression microbe-associated molecular pattern mamp-triggered immunity mechanism action leads reduced levels pattern-recognition receptors plasma membrane involved mamp recognition
