measuring mechanical tension across vinculin reveals regulation focal adhesion dynamics
mechanical forces central developmental physiological pathological processes however limited understanding force transmission within sub-cellular structures major obstacle unravelling molecular mechanisms describe development calibrated biosensor measures forces across specific proteins cells piconewton pn sensitivity demonstrated single molecule fluorescence force spectroscopy method applied vinculin protein connects integrins actin filaments whose recruitment focal adhesions fas force-dependent show tension across vinculin stable fas similar pn vinculin recruitment fas force transmission across vinculin regulated separately highest tension across vinculin associated adhesion assembly enlargement conversely vinculin low force disassembling sliding fas trailing edge migrating cells furthermore vinculin required stabilizing adhesions force together data reveal fa stabilization force requires vinculin recruitment force transmission surprisingly processes can controlled independently
