direct arylation allylic sp c-h bonds via organic photoredox catalysis 
direct functionalization unactivated sp c-h bonds still one challenging problems facing synthetic organic chemists appeal transformations derives capacity facilitate construction complex organic molecules via coupling simple otherwise inert building blocks without introducing extraneous functional groups despite notable recent efforts establishment general mild strategies engagement sp c-h bonds c-c bond forming reactions proved difficult within context discovery chemical transformations able directly functionalize allylic methyl methylene methine carbons catalytic manner priority although protocols direct oxidation amination allylic c-h bonds c-h bonds adjacent carbon involved cc bond become widely established engagement allylic substrates c-c bond forming reactions thus far required use pre-functionalized coupling partners particular direct arylation non-functionalized allylic systems enable access series known pharmacophores molecular features responsible drugs action though general solution long-standing challenge remains elusive report use photoredox organic catalysis accomplish mild broadly effective direct allylic c-h arylation c-c bond forming reaction readily accommodates abroad range alkene electron-deficient arene reactants used direct arylation benzylic c-h bonds
