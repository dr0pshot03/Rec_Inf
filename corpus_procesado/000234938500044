vaccinia virus-induced cell motility requires f11l-mediated inhibition rhoa signaling
rhoa signaling plays critical role many cellular processes including cell migration show vaccinia f11l protein interacts directly rhoa inhibiting signaling blocking interaction downstream effectors rho-associated kinase rock mdia rna interference-mediated depletion f11l infection resulted absence vaccinia-induced cell motility inhibition viral morphogenesis disruption rhoa binding site f11l resembles rock led identical phenotype thus inhibition rhoa signaling required vaccinia morphogenesis virus-induced cell motility
