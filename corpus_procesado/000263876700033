dynamic order-disorder atomistic models structural glass formers
glass transition freezing liquid solid state without evident structural order although glassy materials well characterized experimentally existence phase transition glass state remains controversial present numerical evidence existence novel first-order dynamical phase transition atomistic models structural glass formers contrast equilibrium phase transitions occur configuration space transition occurs trajectory space controlled variables drive system equilibrium coexistence established ergodic phase finite relaxation time nonergodic phase immobile molecular configurations thus connect glass transition true phase transition offering possibility unified picture glassy phenomena
