dna-guided dna interference prokaryotic argonaute 
rna interference widely distributed eukaryotes variety functions including antiviral defence gene regulation rna interference pathways use small single-stranded rnassrna molecules guide proteins argonaute ago family complementary ssrna targets: rna-guided rna interference role prokaryotic ago variants remained elusive although bioinformatics analysis suggested involvement host defence demonstrate ago bacterium thermus thermophilus ttago acts barrier uptake propagation foreign dna vivo ttago loaded -phosphorylated dna guides nucleotides length mostly plasmid derived strong bias -end deoxycytidine small interfering dnas guide ttago cleave complementary dna strands hence despite structural homology eukaryotic counterparts ttago functions host defence dna-guided dna interference
