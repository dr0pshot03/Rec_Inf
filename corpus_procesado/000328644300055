dynamical resonances accessible reagent vibrational excitation f plus hd > hf plus d reaction 
experimental limitations vibrational excitation efficiency previously hindered investigation vibrational energy might mediate role dynamical resonances bimolecular reactions report high-resolution crossed-molecular-beam experiment vibrationally excited hdv + f > hf + d reaction two broad peaks backward-scattered hfv products clearly emerge collision energies kilocalories per mole kcal/mol kcal/mol differential cross sections measured range energies attribute features excited feshbach resonances trapped peculiar hfv -d vibrationally adiabatic potential postbarrier region quantum dynamics calculations highly accurate potential energy surface show resonance states correlate hdv state entrance channel therefore can accessed vibrationally excited hd reagent
