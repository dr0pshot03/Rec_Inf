central nervous system stabilizes unstable dynamics learning optimal impedance
manipulate objects use tools must compensate forces arising interaction physical environment recent studies indicate compensation achieved learning internal model dynamics- neural representation relation motor command movement studies interaction physical environment stable many common tasks intrinsically unstable example keeping screwdriver slot screw unstable excessive force parallel slot can cause screwdriver slip misdirected force can cause loss contact screwdriver screw stability may dependent control mechanical impedance human arm mechanical impedance can generate forces resist destabilizing motion examined arm movements unstable dynamic environment created robotic interface results show humans learn stabilize unstable dynamics using skilful energy-efficient strategy selective control impedance geometry
