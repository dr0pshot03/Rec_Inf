selection noise constrains variation eukaryotic promoter
genetic variation segregating within species reflects combined activities mutation selection genetic drift absence selection polymorphisms expected randomsubset new mutations thus comparing effects polymorphisms new mutations provides test selection- evidence selection exists comparisons can identify properties mutations likely persist natural populations investigate mutation selection shaped variation cis-regulatory sequence controlling gene expression empirically determining effects polymorphisms segregating tdh3 promoter among strains saccharomyces cerevisiae comparing effects distribution mutational effects defined point mutations promoter surprisingly find selection expression noise variability expression among genetically identical cells appears greater impact sequence variation tdh3 promoter selection mean expression level necessarily variation expression noise impacts fitness variation mean expression level rather differences distributions mutational effects two phenotypes study shows systematically examining effects new mutations can enrich understanding evolutionary mechanisms also provides rare empirical evidence selection acting expression noise
