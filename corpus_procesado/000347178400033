higher-than-predicted measurement iron opacity solar interior temperatures 
nearly century ago recognized1 radiation absorption stellar matter controls internal temperature profiles within stars laboratory opacity measurements however never performed stellar interior conditions introducing uncertainties stellar models2- particular problem arose236- refined photosphere spectral analysis910 led reductions - per cent inferred amounts carbon nitrogen oxygen sun standard solar models11 using revised element abundances disagree helioseismic observations determine internal solar structure using acoustic oscillations resolved true mean opacity solar interior matter roughly per cent higher predicted236- increased opacity compensates decreased element abundances iron accounts quarter total opacity212 solar radiation/convection zone boundary report measurements wavelength-resolved iron opacity electron temperatures - million kelvin electron densities - x per cubic centimetre conditions similar solar region affects discrepancy most: radiation/convection zone boundary measured wavelength-dependent opacity - per cent higher predicted represents roughly half change mean opacity needed resolve solar discrepancy even though iron one many elements contribute opacity
