higher-than-predicted measurement iron opacity solar interior temperatures 
nearly century ago recognized radiation absorption stellar matter controls internal temperature profiles within stars laboratory opacity measurements however never performed stellar interior conditions introducing uncertainties stellar models- particular problem arose- refined photosphere spectral analysis led reductions per cent inferred amounts carbon nitrogen oxygen sun standard solar models using revised element abundances disagree helioseismic observations determine internal solar structure using acoustic oscillations resolved true mean opacity solar interior matter roughly per cent higher predicted- increased opacity compensates decreased element abundances iron accounts quarter total opacity solar radiation/convection zone boundary report measurements wavelength-resolved iron opacity electron temperatures - million kelvin electron densities - x per cubic centimetre conditions similar solar region affects discrepancy most: radiation/convection zone boundary measured wavelength-dependent opacity per cent higher predicted represents roughly half change mean opacity needed resolve solar discrepancy even though iron one many elements contribute opacity
