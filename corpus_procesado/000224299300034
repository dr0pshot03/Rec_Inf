superconductor superfluid phase transition liquid metallic hydrogen
although hydrogen simplest atoms form simplest solids liquids quantum effects phases considerable consequence light proton mass demonstrable often puzzling influence many physical properties including spatial order date structure dense hydrogen remains experimentally elusive recent studies melting curve hydrogen indicate high experimentally accessible pressures compressed hydrogen will adopt liquid state even low temperatures reaching phase hydrogen also projected pass insulator-to-metal transition raises possibility new state matter: near ground-state liquid metal ordered states quantum domain ordered quantum fluids traditionally categorized superconductors superfluids respective systems feature dissipationless electrical currents mass flow report topological analysis projected phase liquid metallic hydrogen finding may represent new type ordered quantum fluid specifically show liquid metallic hydrogen categorized exclusively superconductor superfluid predict presence magnetic field liquid metallic hydrogen will exhibit several phase transitions ordered states ranging superconductors superfluids
