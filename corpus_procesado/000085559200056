thermal stimulation taste
first electrophysiological recordings animal human taste nerves gave clear evidence thermal sensitivity studies shown many half neurons mammalian taste pathways respond temperature- temperature never shown induce sensations taste assumed thermal stimulation gustatory system somehow nulled show heating cooling small areas tongue can fact cause sensations taste: warming anterior edge tongue chorda tympani nerve cold temperature can evoke sweetness whereas cooling can evoke sourness and/or saltiness thermal taste also occurs rear tongue glossopharyngeal nerve relationship temperature taste different front tongue observations indicate human gustatory system contains several different types thermally sensitive neurons normally contribute sensory code taste
