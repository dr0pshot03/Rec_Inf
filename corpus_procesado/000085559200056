thermal stimulation taste 
first electrophysiological recordings animal1 human2 taste nerves gave clear evidence thermal sensitivity studies shown many half neurons mammalian taste pathways respond temperature3- temperature never shown induce sensations taste assumed thermal stimulation gustatory system somehow nulled6 show heating cooling small areas tongue can fact cause sensations taste: warming anterior edge tongue chorda tympani nerve cold temperature can evoke sweetness whereas cooling can evoke sourness and/or saltiness thermal taste also occurs rear tongue glossopharyngeal nerve relationship temperature taste different front tongue observations indicate human gustatory system contains several different types thermally sensitive neurons normally contribute sensory code taste
