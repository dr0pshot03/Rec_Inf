self-assembling amphiphilic siderophores marine bacteria
aerobic bacteria secrete siderophores facilitate iron acquisition two families siderophores isolated strains belonging two different genera marine bacteria aquachelins halomonas aquamarina strain ds40m3 marinobactins marinobacter sp strains ds40m6 ds40m8 contain unique peptidic head group coordinates ironiii appendage one series fatty acid moieties siderophores low critical micelle concentrations cmcs absence iron marinobactins present micelles concentrations exceeding cmc upon addition ironiii micelles undergo spontaneous phase change form vesicles observations suggest unique iron acquisition mechanisms may evolved marine bacteria
