fast delivery meteorites earth major asteroid collision
large collisions asteroid belt lead temporarily substantial increase rate impacts meteorites earth orbital simulations predict fragments events may arrive considerably faster typical transit times meteorites falling today large impacts part debris transferred directly resonant orbit jupiter efficient meteorite delivery track however verified report high-sensitivity measurements noble gases produced cosmic rays chromite grains unique suite fossil meteorites preserved similar to480 million year old sediments transfer times deduced noble gases short similar to10 years increase stratigraphic height agreement estimated duration sedimentation data provide powerful evidence unusual meteorite occurrence result long-lasting rain meteorites following destruction asteroid show least one strong resonance main asteroid belt can deliver material inner solar system within short timescales suggested dynamical models
