orca3 jasmonate-responsive transcriptional regulator plant primary secondary metabolism 
biosynthesis many classes secondary metabolites plants induced stress hormone jasmonate gene orca3 jasmonate-responsive apetala2 ap2-domain transcription factor catharanthus roseus isolated transferred dna activation tagging orca3 overexpression resulted enhanced expression several metabolite biosynthetic genes consequently increased accumulation terpenoid indole alkaloids regulation metabolite biosynthetic genes jasmonate-responsive ap2-domain transcription factors may link plant stress responses changes metabolism
