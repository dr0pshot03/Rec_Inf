programming cells multiplex genome engineering accelerated evolution 
breadth genomic diversity found among organisms nature allows populations adapt diverse environments however genomic diversity difficult generate laboratory new phenotypes easily arise practical timescales although vitro directed evolution methods- created genetic variants usefully altered phenotypes methods limited laborious serial manipulation single genes used parallel continuous directed evolution gene networks genomes describe multiplex automated genome engineering mage large-scale programming evolution cells mage simultaneously targets many locations chromosome modification single cell across population cells thus producing combinatorial genomic diversity process cyclical scalable constructed prototype devices automate mage technology facilitate rapid continuous generation diverse set genetic changes mismatches insertions deletions applied mage optimize deoxy-d-xylulose--phosphate dxp biosynthesis pathway escherichia coli overproduce industrially important isoprenoid lycopene twenty-four genetic components dxp pathway modified simultaneously using complex pool synthetic dna creating billion combinatorial genomic variants per day isolated variants fivefold increase lycopene production within days significant improvement existing metabolic engineering techniques multiplex approach embraces engineering context evolution expediting design evolution organisms new improved properties
