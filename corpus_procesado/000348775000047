mitotic checkpoint complex binds second cdc20 inhibit active apc/c
spindle assembly checkpoint sac maintains genomic stability delaying chromosome segregation last chromosome attached mitotic spindle sac prevents anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome apc/c ubiquitin ligase recognizing cyclin b securin catalysing incorporation apc/c co-activator cdc20 complex called mitotic checkpoint complex mcc sac works unattached kinetochores generating diffusible wait anaphase signal inhibits apc/c cytoplasm nature signal remains key unsolved problem moreover sac apc/c highly responsive other: apc/c quickly targets cyclin b securin chromosomes attach metaphase rapidly inhibited kinetochore attachment perturbed achieved also unknown show mcc can inhibit second cdc20 already bound activated apc/c show mcc inhibits active apc/c essential sac moreover mechanism can prevent anaphase absence kinetochore signalling thus propose diffusible wait anaphase signal mcc explain reactivating sac can rapidly inhibit active apc/c
