ecological constraints diversification model adaptive radiation
taxonomic diversification commonly occurs adaptive radiation rapid evolution single lineage range genotypes species adapted different ecological niche radiation size measured number new types varies widely phylogenetically distinct taxa- replicate radiations within single taxon ecological opportunities available seem identical show variation energy input productivity environmental disturbance combine determine extent diversification single radiating lineage pseudomonas fluorescens adapting laboratory conditions diversity peaked intermediate rates productivity disturbance declined towards extremes manner reminiscent well-known ecological patterns- mechanism responsible decrease diversity arises pleiotropic fitness costs associated niche specialization effects modulated gradients productivity disturbance results indicate ecological gradients may constrain size adaptive radiations even presence strong diversifying selection associated ecological opportunity decoupling evolutionary diversification ecological coexistence
