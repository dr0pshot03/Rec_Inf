gan photonic-crystal surface-emitting laser blue-violet wavelengths 
shorter wavelength surface emitting laser sources important variety fields including photonics information processing biology report creation current driven blueviolet photonic crystal surface emitting laser developed fabrication method named "air holes retained overgrowth" order construct two dimensional gallium nitride gan/air photonic crystal structure resulting periodic structure photonic crystal band edge effect sufficient successful operation current injection surface emitting laser represents important step development laser sources focused size much less wavelength integrated two dimensionally short wavelengths
