dynamic dna devices assemblies formed shape-complementary non-base pairing 3d components
demonstrate discrete three-dimensional 3d dna components can specifically self-assemble solution basis shape-complementarity without base pairing using principle produced homo-and heteromultimeric objects including micrometer-scale one two-stranded filaments lattices well reconfigurable devices including actuator switchable gear unfoldable nanobook nanorobot multidomain assemblies stabilized via short-ranged nucleobase stacking bonds compete electrostatic repulsion components interfaces using imaging electron microscopy ensemble single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer spectroscopy electrophoretic mobility analysis show balance attractive repulsive interactions thus conformation assemblies may finely controlled global parameters cation concentration temperature allosteric mechanism based strand-displacement reactions
