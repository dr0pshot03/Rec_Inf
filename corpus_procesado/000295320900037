interannual variability oxygen isotopes atmospheric co2 driven el nino 
stable isotope ratios atmospheric co2 o-/o c-/c- monitored since improve understanding global carbon cycle biosphere-atmosphere exchange fluxes affect different atomic masses measurable way interpreting o-/o variability proved difficult however oxygen isotopes co2 influenced carbon cycle water cycle previous attention focused decreasing o-/o ratio 1990s observed global cooperative air sampling network us national oceanic atmospheric administration earth system research laboratory decrease attributed variously number processes including increase northern hemisphere soil respiration global increase c crops expense c forests environmental conditions atmospheric turbulence solar radiation affect co2 exchange leaves atmosphere present years worth data o-/o co2 scripps institution oceanography global flask network show interannual variability strongly related el nino/southern oscillation suggest redistribution moisture rainfall tropics el nino increases o-/o ratio precipitation plant water signal passed atmospheric co2 biosphere-atmosphere gas exchange show decay time el nino anomaly data set can useful constraining global gross primary production analysis shows rapid recovery el nino events implying shorter cycling time co2 respect terrestrial biosphere oceans previously estimated analysis suggests current estimates global gross primary production petagrams carbon per year may low best guess petagrams carbon per year better reflects observed rapid cycling co2 although still tentative revision present new benchmark evaluate global biospheric carbon cycling models
