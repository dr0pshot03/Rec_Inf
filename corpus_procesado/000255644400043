adaptive phenotypic plasticity response climate change wild bird population 
rapid climate change implicated cause evolution poorly adapted populations however phenotypic plasticity provides potential organisms respond rapidly effectively environmental change using year population study great tit parus major united kingdom show individual adjustment behavior response environment enabled population track rapidly changing environment closely individuals markedly invariant response environmental variation suggesting current response may fixed population phenotypic plasticity can thus play central role tracking environmental change; understanding limits plasticity important goal future research
