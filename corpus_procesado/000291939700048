nuclear-receptor-dependent phosphatidylcholine pathway antidiabetic effects 
nuclear hormone receptors regulate diverse metabolic pathways orphan nuclear receptor lrh also known nr5a2 regulates bile acid biosynthesis structural studies identified phospholipids potential lrh ligands- functional relevance unclear show unusual phosphatidylcholine species two saturated carbon fatty acid acyl side chains dilauroyl phosphatidylcholine dlpc lrh agonist ligand vitro dlpc treatment induces bile acid biosynthetic enzymes mouse liver increases bile acid levels lowers hepatic triglycerides serum glucose dlpc treatment also decreases hepatic steatosis improves glucose homeostasis two mouse models insulin resistance antidiabetic lipotropic effects lost liver-specific lrh knockouts findings identify lrh dependent phosphatidylcholine signalling pathway regulates bile acid metabolism glucose homeostasis
