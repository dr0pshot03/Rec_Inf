non-destructive determination local strain nanometre spatial resolution
structure sizes similar mm now standard microelectronics state-of-the-art fabrication techniques can reduce just tens nanometres ref length scales strain induced interfaces can locally distort crystal lattice may turn affect device performance unpredictable way means non-destructively characterizing strain fields high spatial resolution sensitivity therefore highly desirable one approach use raman spectroscopy limited intrinsic similar -mu m resolution limit visible light probes techniques based electron-beam diffraction can achieve desired nanometre-scale resolution either require complex sample preparation procedures may alter original strain field sensitive distortional dilational strain within top tens nanometres sample surface x-rays hand much greater penetration depth hitherto achieved strain analysis sub-micrometre resolution describe magnifying diffraction imaging procedure x-rays achieves spatial resolution nm one dimension sensitivity - relative lattice variations demonstrate suitability procedure strain analysis measuring strain depth profiles beneath oxidized lines silicon crystals
