on-demand single-electron transfer distant quantum dots
single-electron circuits future consisting network quantum dots will require mechanism transport electrons one functional part circuit another example quantum computer decoherence circuit complexity can reduced separating quantum bit qubit manipulation measurement providing means transporting electrons corresponding parts circuit highly controlled tunnelling neighbouring dots demonstrated ability manipulate electrons single-and double-dot systems improving rapidly- distances greater hundred nanometres neither free propagation tunnelling viable maintaining confinement single electrons show single electron may captured surface acoustic wave minimum transferred one quantum dot second unoccupied dot along long empty channel transfer direction may reversed electron moved back forth sixty times-a cumulative distance mm-without error on-chip transfer extends communication quantum dots range may allow integration discrete quantum information processing components devices
