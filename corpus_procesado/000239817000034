probing faintest stars globular star cluster 
ngc second closest globular star cluster sun using days time hubble space telescope constructed ultradeep color-magnitude diagram cluster see clear truncation two major stellar sequences faint red main-sequence stars run well observational limit near theoretical prediction lowest mass stars capable stable hydrogen burning cores also see truncation number counts faint blue stars namely white dwarfs reflects limit bulk white dwarfs can cool lifetime cluster also turn toward bluer colors least luminous objects predicted coolest white dwarfs hydrogen-rich atmospheres formation h resultant collision-induced absorption cause atmospheres become largely opaque infrared radiation
