translocator protein kd target anxiolytics without benzodiazepine-like side effects 
antianxiety drugs anxiolytics work modulating neurotransmitters brain benzodiazepines fast effective anxiolytic drugs however long-term use limited development tolerance withdrawal symptoms ligands translocator protein [ kilodaltons kd] may promote synthesis endogenous neurosteroids also exert anxiolytic effects animal models found translocator protein kd ligand xbd173 enhanced gamma-aminobutyric acid-mediated neurotransmission counteracted induced panic attacks rodents absence sedation tolerance development xbd173 also exerted antipanic activity humans contrast benzodiazepines cause sedation withdrawal symptoms thus translocator protein kd ligands promising candidates fast-acting anxiolytic drugs less severe side effects benzodiazepines
