folding speed limit 
many small proteins seem fold simple process explicable conventional chemical kinetics transition-state theory assumes instant equilibrium reactants high-energy activated state reality equilibration occurs timescales dependent molecules involved analyses break molecular timescale normally short seen experiments can significant length proteins probe directly studied rapidly folding mutants five-helix bundle protein lambda- whose activated state significantly populated folding time-dependent rate coefficient mus signals onset molecular timescale hence ultimate speed limit folding simple model shows molecular timescale represents natural pre-factor transition state models folding
