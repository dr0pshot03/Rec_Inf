tripling capacity wireless communications using electromagnetic polarization 
wireless communications fundamental part modern information infrastructure wireless bandwidth costly1 prompting close examination data channels available using electromagnetic waves classically radio communications relied one channel per frequency although well understood two polarization states planar waves2 allow two distinct information channels; techniques polarization diversity already take advantage this3 recent work4- shown environments scattering urban areas indoors also possess independent spatial channels can used enhance capacity greatly either case relevant signal processing techniques come heading multiple-input/multiple-output communications multiple antennae required access polarization spatial channels show scattering environment extra factor three channel capacity can obtained relative conventional limit using dual-polarized radio signals extra capacity arises six distinguishable electric magnetic states polarization given point rather two usually assumed
