uninterrupted mcm2- function required dna replication fork progression 
little known dna helicases required elongation phase eukaryotic chromosome replication minichromosone maintenance mcm protein complexes dna helicase activity functionally implicated initiating dna replication using improved method constructing conditional degron mutants show depletion mcms initiation irreversibly blocks progression replication forks saccharomyces cerevisiae like escherichia coli dnab sv40 t antigen helicases therefore mcm complex loaded origins initiation essential elongation restricting mcm loading g1 phase ensures initiation elongation occur just per cell cycle
