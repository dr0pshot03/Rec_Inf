genetic evidence panmixia european eel 
panmixia hypothesis-that european eel anguilla anguilla migrate sargasso sea reproduction comprise single randomly mating population-is widely accepted12 true peculiar life history strategy directly impact population genetics species eels european north african rivers belong breeding population random dispersal larvae date panmixia hypothesis remained unchallenged: genetic studies realized eels mitochondrial dna failed detect genetic structure3-; similar lack structure found using allozymes67 exception clinal variation imposed selection89 used highly polymorphic genetic markers provide better resolution1011 investigate genetic structure european eel analysis seven microsatellite loci among samples north atlantic baltic sea mediterranean sea basins reveals global genetic differentiation12 moreover pairwise cavalli-sforza edwards chord distances correlate significantly coastal geographical distance pattern genetic structure implies non-random mating restricted gene flow among eels different sampled locations therefore refute hypothesis panmixia consequently reproductive biology european eel must reconsidered1415
