mammalian sodium channel bnc1 required normal touch sensation 
vertebrate senses touch least understood molecular level ion channels form core mechanosensory complex confer touch sensitivity remain unknown- however similarity brain sodium channel bnc1- nematode proteins involved mechanotransduction indicated might part mechanosensor show disrupting mouse bnc1 gene markedly reduces sensitivity specific component mechanosensation: low-threshold rapidly adapting mechanoreceptors rodent hairy skin mechanoreceptors excited hair movement consistent function found bnc1 lanceolate nerve endings lie adjacent surround hair follicle although bnc1 proposed role ph sensing acid-evoked current cultured sensory neurons response acid-stimulated nociceptors normal bnc1 null mice data identify bnc1 channel essential normal detection light touch indicate bnc1 may central component mechanosensory complex
