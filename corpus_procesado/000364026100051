hedgehog actively maintains adult lung quiescence regulates repair regeneration
postnatal tissue quiescence thought default state absence proliferative stimulus injury although previous studies demonstrated certain embryonic developmental programs reactivated aberrantly adult organs drive repair regeneration- well understood quiescence maintained organs lung displays remarkably low level cellular turnover demonstrate quiescence adult lung actively maintained state regulated hedgehog signalling epithelial-specific deletion sonic hedgehog shh postnatal homeostasis murine lung results proliferative expansion adjacent lung mesenchyme hedgehog signalling initially downregulated acute phase epithelial injury mesenchyme proliferates response returns baseline injury resolution quiescence restored activation hedgehog acute epithelial injury attenuates proliferative expansion lung mesenchyme whereas inactivation hedgehog signalling prevents restoration quiescence injury resolution finally show hedgehog also regulates epithelial quiescence regeneration response injury via mesenchymal feedback mechanism results demonstrate epithelial-mesenchymal interactions coordinated hedgehog actively maintain postnatal tissue homeostasis deregulation hedgehog injury leads aberrant repair regeneration lung
