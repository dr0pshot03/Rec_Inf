catalytic steps nuclear pre-mrna splicing reversible
nuclear pre messenger rna pre mrna splicing essential processing step production mature mrnas eukaryotic genes splicing catalyzed large ribonucleoprotein complex spliceosome composed five small nuclear rnas protein factors despite complexity spliceosome chemistry splicing reaction simple consisting two consecutive transesterification reactions presence introns spliceosomal rnas certain fungi suggested splicing may reversible however never demonstrated experimentally using affinity purified spliceosomes shown catalytic steps splicing can efficiently reversed appropriate conditions results provide considerable insight catalytic
