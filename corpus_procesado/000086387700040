way things move: looking hood molecular motor proteins 
microtubule-based kinesin motors actin-based myosin motors generate motions associated intracellular trafficking cell division muscle contraction early studies suggested molecular motors work different mechanisms recently however become clear kinesin myosin share common core structure convert energy adenosine triphosphate protein motion using similar conformational change strategy many different types mechanical amplifiers evolved operate conjunction conserved core modular design given rise remarkable diversity kinesin myosin motors whose motile properties optimized performing distinct biological functions
