anomalous strength characteristics tilt grain boundaries graphene 
graphene pristine form one strongest materials tested defects influence strength using atomistic calculations find counter standard reasoning graphene sheets large-angle tilt boundaries high density defects strong pristine material unexpectedly much stronger low-angle boundaries fewer defects show trend explained continuum fracture models can understood considering critical bonds strained seven-membered carbon rings lead failure; large-angle boundaries stronger able better accommodate strained rings results provide guidelines designing growth methods obtain sheets strengths close pristine graphene
