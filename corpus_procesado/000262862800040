divergent evolution duplicate genes leads genetic incompatibilities within a-thaliana
genetic incompatibilities resulting interactions two loci represent potential source postzygotic barriers may important factor evolution impair outcome interspecific crosses show crosses strains plant arabidopsis thaliana loci interact epistatically controlling recessive embryo lethality interaction explained divergent evolution occurring among paralogs essential duplicate gene functional copy located locus different accessions paralogs demonstrate genetic heterogeneity respective evolutionary trajectories results widespread incompatibility among strains data suggest passive mechanisms gene duplication extinction represent important source genetic incompatibilities across taxa
