kondo effect integer-spin quantum dot 
kondo effect-a many-body phenomenon condensed-matter physics involving interaction localized spin free electrons-was discovered metals containing small amounts magnetic impurities although now recognized fundamental importance wide class correlated electron systems fabricated structures control single localized spins technological relevance nanoscale electronics experiments already demonstrated artificial realizations isolated magnetic impurities metallic surfaces nanoscale magnets controlled transitions two-electron singlet triplet states tunable kondo effect semiconductor quantum dots- report unexpected kondo effect few-electron quantum dot containing singlet triplet spin states whose energy difference can tuned magnetic field observe effect even number electrons singlet triplet states degenerate characteristic energy scale much larger ordinary spin-/ case
