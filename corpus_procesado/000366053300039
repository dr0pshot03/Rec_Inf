scale dependence rock friction high work rate
determination frictional properties rocks crucial understanding earthquake mechanics earthquakes caused frictional sliding along faults prior studies using rotary shear apparatus- revealed marked decrease frictional strength can cause large stress drop strong shaking increasing slip rate increasing work rate mechanical work rate per unit area equals product shear stress slip rate however important findings obtained experiments using rock specimens dimensions several centimetres much smaller dimensions natural fault order metres use large-scale biaxial friction apparatus metre-sized rock specimens investigate scale-dependent rock friction experiments show rock friction metre-sized rock specimens starts decrease work rate one order magnitude smaller centimetre-sized rock specimens mechanical visual material observations suggest slip-evolved stress heterogeneity fault accounts difference basis observations propose stress-concentrated areas exist frictional slip produces wear materials gouge areas outside resulting stress concentrations areas shear stress fault primarily sustained stress-concentrated areas undergo high work rate areas weaken rapidly cause macroscopic frictional strength decrease abruptly verify idea conducted numerical simulations assuming local friction follows frictional properties observed centimetre-sized rock specimens simulations reproduced macroscopic frictional properties observed metre-sized rock specimens given localized stress concentrations commonly occur naturally results suggest natural fault may lose strength faster expected properties estimated centimetre-sized rock samples
