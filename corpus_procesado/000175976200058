climatic control high-latitude vegetation greening trend pinatubo effect
biogeochemical model vegetation using observed climate data predicts high northern latitude greening trend past two decades observed satellites marked setback trend mount pinatubo volcano eruption observed trend toward earlier spring budburst increased maximum leaf area produced model consequence biogeochemical vegetation responses mainly changes temperature post-pinatubo decline vegetation apparent effect temporary cooling caused eruption high-latitude co2 uptake years predicted consequence differential response heterotrophic respiration net primary production
