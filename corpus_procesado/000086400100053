family candidate taste receptors human mouse
gustatory system mammals can sense four basic taste qualities bitter sweet salty sour well umami taste glutamate- previous studies suggested detection bitter sweet tastants taste receptor cells mouth likely involve g-protein-coupled receptors although two putative g-protein-coupled bitter/sweet taste receptors identified chemical diversity bitter sweet compounds leads one expect larger number different receptors report identification family candidate taste receptors trbs members g-protein-coupled receptor superfamily specifically expressed taste receptor cells cluster genes encoding human trbs located adjacent prp gene locus mouse tightly linked soa genetic locus involved detecting bitter compound sucrose octaacetate- another trb gene found human contig assigned chromosome 5p15 location genetic locus prop controls detection bitter compound n-propyl--thiouracil humans
