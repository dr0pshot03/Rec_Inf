ultrahigh strength high electrical conductivity copper
methods used strengthen metals generally also cause pronounced decrease electrical conductivity tradeoff must made conductivity mechanical strength synthesized pure copper samples high density nanoscale growth twins showed tensile strength times higher conventional coarse-grained copper retaining electrical conductivity comparable pure copper ultrahigh strength originates effective blockage dislocation motion numerous coherent twin boundaries possess extremely low electrical resistivity case types grain boundaries
