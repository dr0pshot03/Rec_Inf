rote cell-specific spoiiie assembly polarity dna transfer
spoiiie mediates postseptational chromosome partitioning bacillus subtilis mechanism controlling direction dna transfer remains obscure demonstrated spoiiie acts dna exporter: spoiiie synthesized larger two cells necessary sporulation mother cell dna translocated smaller forespore however synthesized forespore dna translocated mother cell furthermore dna-tracking domain spoiiie inhibited spoiiie complex assembly forespore thus sporulation chromosome partitioning controlled preferential assembly spoiiie one daughter cell
