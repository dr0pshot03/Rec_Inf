epigenetic regulation long noncoding rnas
recent studies show transcription mammalian genome pervasive also enormously complex estimated average transcription units vast majority make long noncoding rnas lncrnas may overlap traditional coding gene lncrnas include antisense intronic intergenic transcripts also pseudogenes retrotransposons universally function merely transcriptional by-products conventional coding genes glimpse molecular biology multiple emerging lncrna systems reveals wild west landscape functions mechanisms key problems solve years ahead toward understanding intriguing macromolecules
