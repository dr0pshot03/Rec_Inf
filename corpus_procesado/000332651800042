transcriptional switch underlies commitment sexual development malaria parasites 
life cycles many parasites involve transitions disparate host species requiring parasites go multiple developmental stages adapted specialized niches transmission malaria parasites plasmodium spp humans mosquito vector requires differentiation asexual stages replicating within red blood cells non-dividing male female gametocytes although gametocytes first described understanding molecular mechanisms involved commitment gametocyte formation extremely limited disrupting critical developmental transition remains long-standing goal show expression levels dna-binding protein pfap2-g correlate strongly levels gametocyte formation using independent forward reverse genetics approaches demonstrate pfap2-g function essential parasite sexual differentiation combining genome-wide pfap2-g cognate motif occurrence global transcriptional changes resulting pfap2-g ablation identify early gametocyte genes probable targets pfap2-g show regulation pfap2-g critical wild-type level expression asexual blood-stage parasites pfap2-g appears among set epigenetically silenced loci prone spontaneous activation stochastic activation presents simple mechanism low baseline gametocyte production overall findings identify pfap2-g master regulator sexual-stage development malaria parasites mark first discovery transcriptional switch controlling differentiation decision protozoan parasites
