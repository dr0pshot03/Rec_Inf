sensing chromosome bi-orientation spatial separation aurora b kinase kinetochore substrates 
successful cell division requires chromosomes attach opposite poles mitotic spindle bi-orientation aurora b kinase regulates chromosome-spindle attachments phosphorylating kinetochore substrates bind microtubules centromere tension stabilizes bi-oriented attachments physical forces translated signaling individual centromeres unknown using fluorescence resonance energy transfer-based biosensors measure localized phosphorylation dynamics living cells found phosphorylation aurora b substrate kinetochore depended distance kinase inner centromere furthermore repositioning aurora b closer kinetochore prevented stabilization bi-oriented attachments activated spindle checkpoint thus centromere tension can sensed increased spatial separation aurora b kinetochore substrates reduces phosphorylation stabilizes kinetochore microtubules
