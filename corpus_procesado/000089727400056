ldl-receptor-related protein mediates wnt signalling mice
wnt genes comprise large family secreted polypeptides expressed spatially tissue-restricted patterns vertebrate embryonic development mutational analysis mice shown importance wnts controlling diverse developmental processes patterning body axis central nervous system limbs regulation inductive events organogenesis although many components wnt signalling pathway identified little known wnts cognate frizzled receptors signal downstream effector molecules present evidence new member low-density lipoprotein ldl-receptor-related protein family lrp6 ref critical wnt signalling mice embryos homozygous insertion mutation lrp6 gene exhibit developmental defects striking composite caused mutations individual wnt genes furthermore show genetic enhancement wnt mutant phenotype mice lacking one functional copy lrp6 together results support broad role lrp6 transduction several wnt signals mammals
