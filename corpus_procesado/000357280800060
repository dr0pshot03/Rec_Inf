single-cell-initiated monosynaptic tracing reveals layer-specific cortical network modules 
individual cortical neurons can selectively respond specific environmental features visual motion faces relates selectivity presynaptic network across cortical layers remains unclear used single-cell-initiated monosynaptically restricted retrograde transsynaptic tracing rabies viruses expressing gcamp6s image vivo visual motion-evoked activity individual layer / pyramidal neurons presynaptic networks across layers mouse primary visual cortex neurons within layer exhibited similar motion direction preferences forming layer-specific functional modules one-third networks layer modules locked directionpreference postsynaptic neuron whereas networks direction preference varied layer thus exist feature-locked feature-variant cortical networks
