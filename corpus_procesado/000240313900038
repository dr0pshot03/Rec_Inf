finite lifetime turbulence shear flows 
generally motion fluids smooth laminar low speeds becomes highly disordered turbulent velocity increases transition laminar turbulent flow can involve sequence instabilities system realizes progressively complicated states can occur suddenly transition taken place generally assumed steady conditions turbulent state will persist indefinitely flow fluid straight pipe provides ubiquitous example shear flow undergoing sudden transition laminar turbulent motion- extensive calculations experimental studies shown relatively low flow rates turbulence pipes transient characterized exponential distribution lifetimes also suggest reynolds numbers exceeding critical value lifetime diverges becomes infinitely large marking change transient persistent turbulence present experimental data numerical calculations covering two decades lifetimes showing lifetime fact diverge rather increases exponentially reynolds number implies turbulence pipes transient event contrary commonly accepted view turbulent laminar states remain dynamically connected suggesting avenues turbulence control
