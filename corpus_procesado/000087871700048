postsynaptic translation affects efficacy morphology neuromuscular junctions 
long-term synaptic plasticity may associated structural rearrangements within neuronal circuitry12 although molecular mechanisms governing activity-controlled morphological alterations mostly elusive polysomal accumulations base developing dendritic spines3 activity-induced synthesis synaptic components suggest localized translation involved synaptic plasticity45 show large aggregates translational components well messenger rna postsynaptic glutamate receptor subunit dglur-iia6 localized within subsynaptic compartments larval neuromuscular junctions drosophila melanogaster genetic models junctional plasticity7 genetic manipulations using translation initiation factors eif4e8 polyabinding protein9 showed increased occurrence subsynaptic translation aggregates associated significant increase postsynaptic dglur-iia protein levels reduction junctional expression cell-adhesion molecule fasciclin ii addition efficacy junctional neurotransmission size larval neuromuscular junctions significantly increased results therefore provide evidence postsynaptic translational control long-term junctional plasticity
