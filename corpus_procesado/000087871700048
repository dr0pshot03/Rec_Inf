postsynaptic translation affects efficacy morphology neuromuscular junctions
long-term synaptic plasticity may associated structural rearrangements within neuronal circuitry although molecular mechanisms governing activity-controlled morphological alterations mostly elusive polysomal accumulations base developing dendritic spines activity-induced synthesis synaptic components suggest localized translation involved synaptic plasticity show large aggregates translational components well messenger rna postsynaptic glutamate receptor subunit dglur-iia localized within subsynaptic compartments larval neuromuscular junctions drosophila melanogaster genetic models junctional plasticity genetic manipulations using translation initiation factors eif4e polyabinding protein showed increased occurrence subsynaptic translation aggregates associated significant increase postsynaptic dglur-iia protein levels reduction junctional expression cell-adhesion molecule fasciclin ii addition efficacy junctional neurotransmission size larval neuromuscular junctions significantly increased results therefore provide evidence postsynaptic translational control long-term junctional plasticity
