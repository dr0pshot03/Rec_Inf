topography synaptic shaping direction selectivity primary auditory cortex
direction frequency-modulated fm sweeps important temporal cue animal human communication fm direction-selective neurons found primary auditory cortex a1 topography mechanisms underlying selectivity remain largely unknown report rat a1 direction selectivity topographically ordered parallel characteristic frequency cf: low cf neurons preferred upward sweeps whereas high cf neurons preferred downward sweeps asymmetry inhibitory sidebands suppressive regions flanking tonal receptive field trf spike response also co-varied cf vivo whole-cell recordings showed direction selectivity already present synaptic inputs enhanced cortical synaptic inhibition suppressed synaptic excitation nonpreferred direction preferred excitatory inhibitory synaptic trfs identical spectral tuning inhibition delayed relative excitation spectral asymmetry synaptic trfs co-varied cf direction selectivity sideband asymmetry thus suggested synaptic mechanism shaping fm direction selectivity topographic ordering
