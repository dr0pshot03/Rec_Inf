study superfluid fermion pairs periodic potential important ramifications understanding superconductivity crystalline materials using cold atomic gases various models condensed matter can studied highly controllable environment weakly repulsive fermions optical lattice undergo d-wave pairing low temperatures possible mechanism high temperature superconductivity copper oxides lattice potential also strongly increase critical temperature s-wave superfluidity recent experimental advances bulk atomic gases include observation fermion-pair condensates high-temperature superfluidity- experiments fermions- bosonic bound pairs optical lattices reported yet addressed superfluid behaviour report observation distinct interference peaks condensate fermionic atom pairs released optical lattice implying long-range order property superfluid conceptually means s-wave pairing coherence fermion pairs now established lattice potential transport atoms occurs quantum mechanical tunnelling simple propagation observations made interactions sides feshbach resonance larger lattice depths coherence lost reversible manner possibly result transition superfluid insulator strongly interacting fermions optical lattice can used study new class hamiltonians interband atom molecule couplings
