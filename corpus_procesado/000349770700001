lunar dynamo
inductive generation magnetic fields fluid planetary interiors known dynamo process although moon today global magnetic field known since apollo era lunar rocks crust magnetized recently unclear whether magnetization product core dynamo fields generated externally moon new laboratory spacecraft measurements strongly indicate much magnetization product ancient core dynamo dynamo field persisted least billion years ago ga intensity reaching present earth field declined least order magnitude similar ga mechanisms sustaining intense long-lived dynamo uncertain may include mechanical stirring mantle core crystallization
