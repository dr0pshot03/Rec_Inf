spatial organization within niche determinant stem-cell fate
stem-cell niches mammalian tissues often heterogeneous compartmentalized however whether distinct niche locations determine different stem-cell fates remains unclear test hypothesis use mouse hair follicle niche combine intravital microscopy genetic lineage tracing re-visit stem-cell lineages exact place origin throughout regeneration live mice using method show directly position stem cell within hair follicle niche can predict whether likely remain uncommitted generate precursors commit differentiated fate furthermore using laser ablation demonstrate hair follicle stem cells dispensable regeneration epithelial cells normally participate hair growth re-populate lost stem-cell compartment sustain hair regeneration study provides general model niche-induced fate determination adult tissues
