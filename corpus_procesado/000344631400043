experimental realization topological haldane model ultracold fermions 
haldane model honeycomb lattice paradigmatic example hamiltonian featuring topologically distinct phases matter1 describes mechanism quantum hall effect can appear intrinsic property band structure rather caused external magnetic field2 although physical implementation considered unlikely haldane model provided conceptual basis theoretical experimental research exploring topological insulators superconductors2- report experimental realization haldane model characterization topological band structure using ultracold fermionic atoms periodically modulated optical honeycomb lattice haldane model based breaking time-reversal symmetry inversion symmetry break time-reversal symmetry introduce complex next-nearest-neighbour tunnelling terms induce circular modulation lattice position7 break inversion symmetry create energy offset neighbouring sites8 breaking either symmetries opens gap band structure probe using momentum-resolved interband transitions explore resulting berry curvatures characterize topology lowest band applying constant force atoms find orthogonal drifts analogous hall current competition two broken symmetries gives rise transition topologically distinct regimes identifying vanishing gap single dirac point map transition line experimentally quantitatively compare calculations using floquet theory without free parameters verify approach allows us tune topological properties dynamically suitable even interacting fermionic systems furthermore propose direct extension realize spin-dependent topological hamiltonians
