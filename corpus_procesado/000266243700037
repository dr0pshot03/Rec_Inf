bmi1 regulates mitochondrial function dna damage response pathway
mice deficient polycomb repressor bmi1 develop numerous abnormalities including severe defect stem cell self-renewal alterations thymocyte maturation shortened lifespan previous work implicated de-repression ink4a/arf also known cdkn2a locus mediating many aspects bmi1-/- phenotype demonstrate cells derived bmi1-/- mice also impaired mitochondrial function marked increase intracellular levels reactive oxygen species subsequent engagement dna damage response pathway furthermore many deficiencies normally observed bmi1-/- mice improve either pharmacological treatment antioxidant n-acetylcysteine genetic disruption dna damage response pathway chk2 also known chek2 deletion results demonstrate bmi1 unexpected role maintaining mitochondrial function redox homeostasis indicate polycomb family proteins can coordinately regulate cellular metabolism stem progenitor cell function
