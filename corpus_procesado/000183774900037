myosin v walks hand-over-hand: single fluorophore imaging -nm localization
myosin v dimeric molecular motor moves processively actin center mass moving similar to37 nanometers adenosine triphosphate hydrolyzed labeled myosin v single fluorophore different positions light-chain domain measured step size standard deviation < nanometers -second temporal resolution observation times minutes step size alternates + 2x nm 2x x distance along direction motion dye midpoint two heads results strongly support hand-over-hand model motility inchworm model
