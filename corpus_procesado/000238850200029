hox control organ size regulation morphogen production mobility 
selector genes modify developmental pathways sculpt animal body parts although body parts differ size ways selector genes create size differences unknown studied drosophila hox gene ultrabithorax ubx limits size haltere end larval development similar fivefold fewer cells wing find ubx controls haltere size restricting transcription mobility morphogen decapentaplegic dpp ubx restricts dpps distribution haltere increasing amounts dpp receptor thickveins morphogens control tissue growth many contexts findings provide potentially general mechanism selector genes modify organ sizes
