three-dimensional optical photonic crystal designed point defects
photonic crystals- offer unprecedented opportunities miniaturization integration optical devices also exhibit variety new physical phenomena including suppression enhancement spontaneous emission low-threshold lasing quantum information processing various techniques fabrication three-dimensional 3d photonic crystals-such silicon micromachining wafer fusion bonding holographic lithography self-assembly angled-etching micromanipulation glancing-angle deposition autocloning-have proposed demonstrated different levels success however critical step towards fabrication functional 3d devices incorporation microcavities waveguides controllable way achieved optical wavelengths present fabrication 3d photonic crystals particularly suited optical device integration using lithographic layer-by-layer approach point-defect microcavities introduced fabrication process optical measurements show resonant signatures around telecommunications wavelengths - mum measurements reflectance transmittance near-infrared good agreement numerical simulations
