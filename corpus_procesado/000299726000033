dna breaks chromosome pulverization errors mitosis 
involvement whole-chromosome aneuploidy tumorigenesis subject debate large part lack insight underlying mechanisms identify mechanism errors mitotic chromosome segregation generate dna breaks via formation structures called micronuclei whole-chromosome-containing micronuclei form mitotic errors produce lagging chromosomes tracked fate newly generated micronuclei found undergo defective asynchronous dna replication resulting dna damage often extensive fragmentation chromosome micronucleus micronuclei can persist cells several generations chromosome micronucleus can also distributed daughter nuclei thus chromosome segregation errors potentially lead mutations chromosome rearrangements can integrate genome pulverization chromosomes micronuclei may also one explanation chromothripsis cancer developmental disorders isolated chromosomes chromosome arms undergo massive local dna breakage rearrangement
