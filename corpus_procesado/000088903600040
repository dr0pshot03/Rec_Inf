changes greenland ice sheet elevation attributed primarily snow accumulation variability 
response grounded ice sheets changing climate critically influences possible future changes sea level recent satellite surveys southern greenland show little overall elevation change higher elevations large spatial variability- using satellite studies alone possible determine geophysical processes responsible observed elevation changes decide recent rates change exceed natural variability derive changes ice-sheet elevation southern greenland years using physically based model firn densification records annual snow accumulation reconstructed ice cores high elevation patterns accumulation-driven elevation change agree closely contemporaneous satellite measurements ice-sheet elevation change therefore attribute changes observed variability snow accumulation similar analyses longer ice-core records show decade greenland ice sheet exhibited typical variability high elevations well within long-term natural variability results indicate better understanding ice-sheet mass changes will require long-term measurements surface elevation snow accumulation
