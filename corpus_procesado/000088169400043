anti-apoptotic role p53 family member p73 developmental neuron death
p53 plays essential pro-apoptotic role function thought shared family members p73 p63 show p73 primarily present developing neurons truncated isoform whose levels dramatically decreased sympathetic neurons apoptose nerve growth factor ngf withdrawal increased expression truncated p73 rescues neurons apoptosis induced ncf withdrawal p53 overexpression p73-/ mice isoforms p73 deleted apoptosis developing sympathetic neurons greatly enhanced thus truncated p73 essential anti-apoptotic protein neurons serving counteract pro-apoptotic function p53
