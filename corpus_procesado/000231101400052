coupling neuronal firing field potentials fmr1 human auditory cortex 
functional magnetic resonance imaging fmri important tool investigating human brain function relationship hemodynamicatly based fmri signals human brain underlying neuronal activity unclear recorded single unit activity local field potentials auditory cortex two neurosurgical patients compared fmri signals healthy subjects presentation identical movie segment predicted fmri signals derived single units measured fmri signals auditory cortex showed highly significant correlation r 7s p <- thus fmri signals can provide reliable measure firing rate human cortical neurons
