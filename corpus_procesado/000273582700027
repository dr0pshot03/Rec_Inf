comprehensive catalogue somatic mutations human cancer genome
cancers carry somatic mutations subset somatic alterations termed driver mutations confer selective growth advantage implicated cancer development whereas remainder passengers sequenced genomes malignant melanoma lymphoblastoid cell line person providing first comprehensive catalogue somatic mutations individual cancer catalogue provides remarkable insights forces shaped cancer genome dominant mutational signature reflects dna damage due ultraviolet light exposure known risk factor malignant melanoma whereas uneven distribution mutations across genome lower prevalence gene footprints indicates dna repair preferentially deployed towards transcribed regions results illustrate power cancer genome sequence reveal traces dna damage repair mutation selection processes operative years cancer became symptomatic
