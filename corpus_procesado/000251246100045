genome-wide experimental determination barriers horizontal gene transfer
horizontal gene transfer genetic material transferred genome one organism another investigated microbial species mainly computational sequence analyses address lack experimental data studied attempted movement genes prokaryotic genomes escherichia coli identified genes consistently fail transfer studied mechanisms underlying transfer inhibition placing coding regions different species control inducible promoters data suggest toxicity host inhibited transfer regardless species origin increased gene dosage associated increased expression may predominant cause transfer failure although experimental studies examined transfer solely e coli computational analysis gene-transfer rates across available bacterial archaeal genomes supports barriers observed study general across tree life
