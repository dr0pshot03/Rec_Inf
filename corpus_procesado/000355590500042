tuning friction atom-by-atom ion-crystal simulator 
friction ordered atomically smooth surfaces nanoscale nanofriction often governed stick-slip processes test long-standing atomistic models processes implemented synthetic nanofriction interface laser-cooled coulomb crystal individually addressable ions moving object periodic light-field potential substrate show stick-slip friction can tuned maximal nearly frictionless via arrangement ions relative substrate varying ion number also show strong dependence friction structural mismatch predicted many-particle models already emerges level two three atoms model system enables microscopic systematic investigation friction potentially even quantum many-body regime
