actin-dependent step mitochondrial fission mediated er-associated formin inf2
mitochondrial fission fundamentally important cellular physiology dynamin-related protein drp1 mediates fission interaction mitochondrion endoplasmic reticulum er enhances fission however mechanism drp1 recruitment mitochondria unclear although previous results implicate actin involvement found actin polymerization er-localized inverted formin inf2 required efficient mitochondrial fission mammalian cells inf2 functioned upstream drp1 actin filaments appeared accumulate mitochondria inf2-enriched er membranes constriction sites thus inf2-induced actin filaments may drive initial mitochondrial constriction allows drp1-driven secondary constriction inf2 mutations can lead charcot-marie-tooth disease results provide potential cellular mechanism disease state
