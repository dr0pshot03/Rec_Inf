crystal structure avian influenza polymerase pan reveals endonuclease active site 
heterotrimeric influenza virus polymerase containing pa pb1 pb2 proteins catalyses viral rna replication transcription nucleus infected cells pb1 holds polymerase active site reportedly harbours endonuclease activity whereas pb2 responsible cap binding- pa amino terminus understood major functional part pa protein implicated several roles including endonuclease protease activities well viral rna/complementary rna promoter binding report angstrom angstrom crystal structure n-terminal residues pa termed pan avian influenza h5n1 virus pan structure alpha/beta architecture reveals bound magnesium ion coordinated motif similar p dxnd/e xk motif characteristic many endonucleases structural comparisons mutagenesis analysis motif identified pan provide evidence pan holds endonuclease active site furthermore functional analysis vivo ribonucleoprotein reconstitution direct vitro endonuclease assays strongly suggest pan holds endonuclease active site critical roles endonuclease activity influenza virus polymerase rather pb1 high conservation endonuclease active site among influenza strains indicates pan important target design new anti-influenza therapeutics
