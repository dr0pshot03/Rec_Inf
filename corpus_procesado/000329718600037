lenalidomide causes selective degradation ikzf1 ikzf3 multiple myeloma cells 
lenalidomide drug clinical efficacy multiple myeloma b cell neoplasms mechanism action unknown using quantitative proteomics found lenalidomide causes selective ubiquitination degradation two lymphoid transcription factors ikzf1 ikzf3 crbn-crl4 ubiquitin ligase ikzf1 ikzf3 essential transcription factors multiple myeloma single amino acid substitution ikzf3 conferred resistance lenalidomide-induced degradation rescued lenalidomide-induced inhibition cell growth similarly found lenalidomide-induced interleukin production t cells due depletion ikzf1 ikzf3 findings reveal previously unknown mechanism action therapeutic agent: alteration activity e3 ubiquitin ligase leading selective degradation specific targets
