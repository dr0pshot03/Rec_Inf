developmental pattern formation: insights physics biology
spatial organization cell fates development involves interpretation morphogen gradients cellular signaling cascades transcriptional networks recent studies use biophysical models genetics quantitative imaging unravel tissue-level morphogen behavior arises subcellular events moreover data several systems show morphogen gradients downstream signaling activity cell-intrinsic transcriptional networks change dynamically pattern formation studies drosophila now also vertebrates suggest transcriptional network dynamics central generation gene expression patterns together leads view pattern formation emergent behavior results coordination events occurring across molecular cellular tissue scales development novel approaches study complex process remains challenge
