nodule-specific protein secretory pathway required nitrogen-fixing symbiosis
nitrogen-fixing symbiosis sinorhizobium meliloti leguminous host plant medicago truncatula occurs specialized root organ called nodule bacteria released plant cells surrounded unique plant membrane compartment termed symbiosome found symbiosis-defective dnf1 mutant m truncatula bacteroid symbiosome development blocked identified dnf1 gene encoding subunit signal peptidase complex highly expressed nodules analyzing data whole-genome expression analysis propose correct symbiosome development m truncatula requires orderly secretion protein constituents coordinated up-regulation nodule-specific pathway exemplified dnf1
