increase global temperature variability despite changing regional patterns 
evidence greenland ice cores shows year-to-year temperature variability probably higher past cold periods considerable interest determining whether global warming increasing climate variability present- interest motivated understanding increased variability resulting extreme weather conditions may difficult society adapt altered mean conditions far however spite suggestions increased variability considerable uncertainty whether occurring show although fluctuations annual temperature indeed shown substantial geographical variation past decades time-evolving standard deviation globally averaged temperature anomalies stable feature changes tendency many regions low variability experience increases might contribute perception increased climate volatility normalization temperature anomalies creates impression larger relative overall increases use absolute values argue appropriate approach reveals little change regionally greater year-to-year changes recently occurred much north america europe many climate models predict total variability will ultimately decrease high greenhouse gas concentrations possibly associated reductions sea-ice cover findings contradict view warming world will automatically one overall climatic variation
