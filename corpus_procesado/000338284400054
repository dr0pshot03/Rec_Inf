mapping pressurized volcanic fluids induced crustal seismic velocity drops 
volcanic eruptions caused release pressure accumulated due hot volcanic fluids depth show extent regions affected pressurized fluids can imaged measurement response transient stress perturbations used records seismic noise japanese hi-net seismic network measure crustal seismic velocity changes volcanic regions caused moment magnitude m-w tohoku-oki earthquake interpret coseismic crustal seismic velocity reductions related mechanical weakening pressurized crust dynamic stress associated seismic waves suggest therefore mapping seismic velocity susceptibility dynamic stress perturbations can used imaging characterization volcanic systems
