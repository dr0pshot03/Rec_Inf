inverse velocity dependence vibrationally promoted electron emission metal surface
previous experimental theoretical studies molecular interactions metal surfaces show electronically nonadiabatic influences increase molecular velocity report observation nonadiabatic electronic effect follows opposite trend: probability electron emission low work function surface-au capped half monolayer cs increases velocity incident molecule decreases collisions highly vibrationally excited nox pi/ v v vibrational quantum number reaching lowest velocity studied show results consistent vibrational autodetachment mechanism whereby electron emission possible beyond certain critical distance surface outcome implies important energy dissipation pathways involving nonadiabatic electronic excitations furthermore captured present theoretical methods may influence reaction rates surfaces
