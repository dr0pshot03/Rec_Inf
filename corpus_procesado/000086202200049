t cell-independent rescue b lymphocytes peripheral immune tolerance 
autoimmunity arises immune tolerance specific self-antigens broken mechanisms leading failure remain poorly understood one hypothesis proposes infectious agents antigens can break b t lymphocyte self-tolerance expressing epitopes mimic self using transgenic immunoglobulin model show challenge self-mimicking foreign antigen rescues b cells peripheral tolerance independent t cell help resulting accumulation self-reactive cells lymph nodes secretion immunoglobulins bind liver-expressed self-antigen therefore studies reveal potentially important mechanism b lymphocytes can escape self-tolerance
