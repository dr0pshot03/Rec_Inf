rna translocation unwinding mechanism hcvns3 helicase coordination atp
helicases ubiquitous class enzymes involved nearly aspects dna rna metabolism despite recent progress understanding mechanism action limited resolution left inaccessible detailed mechanisms enzymes couple rearrangement nucleic acid structures binding hydrolysis atp observing individual mechanistic cycles motor proteins central understanding cellular functions follow real time resolution two base pairs ms rna translocation unwinding cycles hepatitis c virus helicase ns3 monomer ns3 representative superfamily helicase essential viral replication therefore potentially important drug target show cyclic movement ns3 coordinated atp discrete steps +/ base pairs actual unwinding occurs rapid smaller substeps +/ base pairs also triggered atp binding indicating ns3 might move like inchworm atp-coupling mechanism likely applicable non-hexameric helicases involved many essential cellular functions assay developed useful investigating broad range nucleic acid translocation motors
