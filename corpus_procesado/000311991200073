evolution mcm complex flies promotes meiotic crossovers blocking blm helicase 
generation meiotic crossovers many eukaryotes requires elimination anti-crossover activities using msh4-msh5 heterodimer block helicases msh4 msh5 lost flies drosophila glossina identified complex minichromosome maintenance mcm proteins functionally replace msh4-msh5 found rec ortholog mcm8 evolved strong positive selection flies interacts mei- mei- arose previously undescribed metazoan-specific mcm protein meiotic crossovers reduced drosophila rec mei- mei- mutants; however removal bloom syndrome helicase blm ortholog restored crossovers thus mcms co-opted novel complex replaced meiotic pro-crossover function msh4-msh5 flies
