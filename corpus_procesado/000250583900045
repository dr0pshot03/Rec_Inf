disentangling genetic variation resistance tolerance infectious diseases animals
hosts can principle employ two different strategies defend parasites: resistance tolerance animals typically exhibit considerable genetic variation resistance ability limit parasite burden however little known whether animals can evolve tolerance ability limit damage caused given parasite burden using rodent malaria laboratory mice model system statistical framework developed plant-pathogen biologists demonstrated genetic variation tolerance measured extent anemia weight loss increased increasing parasite burden moreover resistance tolerance negatively genetically correlated results mean animals like plants can evolve two conceptually different types defense finding important implications understanding epidemiology evolution infectious diseases
