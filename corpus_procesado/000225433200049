bcl6 proto-oncogene suppresses p53 expression germinal-centre b cells 
human proto-oncogene bcl6 encodes btb/poz-zinc-finger transcriptional repressor necessary germinal-centre formation implicated pathogenesis b-cell lymphoma- precise function bcl6 germinal-centre development lymphomagenesis unclear direct bcl6 target genes identified- report bcl6 suppresses expression p53 also known tp53 tumour suppressor gene modulates dna damage-induced apoptotic responses germinal-centre b cells bcl6 represses p53 transcription binding two specific dna sites within p53 promoter region accordingly p53 expression absent germinal-centre b cells bcl6 highly expressed suppression bcl6 expression via specific short interfering rna leads increased levels p53 messenger rna protein basal conditions response dna damage notably constitutive expression bcl6 protects b cell lines apoptosis induced dna damage results suggest important function bcl6 allow germinal-centre b cells tolerate physiological dna breaks required immunoglobulin class switch recombination somatic hypermutation without inducing p53-dependent apoptotic response findings also imply deregulated bcl6 expression contributes lymphomagenesis part functional inactivation p53
