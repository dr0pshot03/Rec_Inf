synaptotagmin functions calcium regulator release probability 
synapses ca2+ triggers neurotransmitter release initiate signal transmission ca2+ presumably acts activating synaptic ca2+ sensors nature sensors-which gatekeepers neurotransmission-remains unclear one candidate ca2+ sensors release synaptic ca2+-binding protein synaptotagmin studied point mutation synaptotagmin causes twofold decrease overall ca2+ affinity without inducing structural conformational changes introduced homologous recombination endogenous synaptotagmin gene mice point mutation decreases ca2+ sensitivity neurotransmitter release twofold alter spontaneous release size readily releasable pool neurotransmitters therefore ca2+ binding synaptotagmin participates triggering neurotransmitter release synapse
