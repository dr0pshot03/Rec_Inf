enzyme-free nucleic acid logic circuits 
biological organisms perform complex information processing control tasks using sophisticated biochemical circuits yet engineering circuits remains ineffective compared electronic circuits systematically create complex yet reliable circuits electrical engineers use digital logic wherein gates subcircuits composed modularly signal restoration prevents signal degradation report design experimental implementation dna-based digital logic circuits demonstrate gates signal restoration amplification feedback cascading gate design circuit construction modular gates use single-stranded nucleic acids inputs outputs mechanism relies exclusively sequence recognition strand displacement biological nucleic acids micrornas can serve inputs suggesting applications biotechnology bioengineering
