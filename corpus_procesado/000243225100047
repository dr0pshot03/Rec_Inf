prokaryotic proton-gated ion channel nicotinic acetylcholine receptor family 
ligand-gated ion channels lgics mediate excitatory inhibitory transmission nervous system among pentameric cys-loop receptors plgics compose family recently found eukaryotes yet recent genome search identified putative homologues proteins several bacterial species report cloning expression functional identification one putative homologues cyanobacterium gloeobacter violaceus expressed homo-oligomer hek cells xenopus oocytes generating transmembrane cationic channel opened extracellular protons shows slow kinetics activation desensitization single channel conductance ps electron microscopy cross-linking experiments protein fused maltose-binding protein expressed escherichia coli consistent homo-pentameric organization sequence comparison shows possesses compact structure absence amino-terminal helix canonical disulphide bridge large cytoplasmic domain found eukaryotic plgics therefore embodies minimal structure required signal transduction data establish prokaryotic origin family gloeobacter violaceus carries photosynthesis proton transport cytoplasmic membrane new proton-gated ion channel might contribute adaptation ph change
