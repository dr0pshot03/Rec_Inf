quantum criticality: competing ground states low dimensions
small changes external parameter can often lead dramatic qualitative changes lowest energy quantum mechanical ground state correlated electron system anisotropic crystals high-temperature superconductors electron motion occurs primarily two-dimensional square lattice quantum critical point two lowest energy states nontrivial emergent excitations control physics significant portion phase diagram nonzero temperature dynamic properties near quantum critical points described using simple theoretical models possible quantum phases transitions two-dimensional electron gas square lattice discussed
