polycomb group protein ezh2 involved progression prostate cancer 
prostate cancer leading cause cancer-related death males second lung cancer although effective surgical radiation treatments exist clinically localized prostate cancer metastatic prostate cancer remains essentially incurable show gene expression profiling polycomb group protein enhancer zeste homolog ezh2 overexpressed hormone-refractory metastatic prostate cancer small interfering rna sirna duplexes targeted ezh2 reduce amounts ezh2 protein present prostate cells also inhibit cell proliferation vitro ectopic expression ezh2 prostate cells induces transcriptional repression specific cohort genes gene silencing mediated ezh2 requires set domain attenuated inhibiting histone deacetylase activity amounts ezh2 messenger rna ezh2 protein increased metastatic prostate cancer addition clinically localized prostate cancers express higher concentrations ezh2 show poorer prognosis thus dysregulated expression ezh2 may involved progression prostate cancer well marker distinguishes indolent prostate cancer risk lethal progression
