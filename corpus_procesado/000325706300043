olivine crystals align diffusion creep earths upper mantle
crystallographic preferred orientation cpo olivine produced dislocation creep considered primary cause elastic anisotropy earths upper mantle often used determine direction mantle flow fundamental question remains however whether alignment olivine crystals uniquely produced dislocation creep report development cpo iron-free olivine forsterite diffusion creep intensity pattern cpo depend temperature presence melt control appearance crystallographic planes grain boundaries grain boundary sliding crystallography-controlled boundaries accommodated diffusion contributes grain rotation resulting cpo show strong radial anisotropy anticipated temperatures corresponding depths melting initiates depths strongly anisotropic low seismic velocities detected conversely weak anisotropy anticipated temperatures corresponding depths almost isotropic mantle found propose diffusion creep primary means mantle flow
