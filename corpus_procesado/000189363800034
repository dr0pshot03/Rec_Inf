hybrid fracture transition extension fracture shear fracture 
fracture fundamental mechanism material failure two basic types brittle fractures commonly observed rock deformation experiments-extension opening mode fractures shear fractures nearly half century hypothesized extension shear fractures represent end-members continuous spectrum brittle fracture types- however observations transitional fractures display opening shear modes hybrids naturally deformed rock often remained ambiguous clear demonstration hybrid fracture formation provided experiments present results triaxial extension experiments carrara marble show continuous transition extension fracture shear fracture increase compressive stress hybrid fractures form mixed tensile compressive stress states acute angles maximum principal compressive stress fracture angles greater observed extension fractures less observed shear fractures fracture surfaces also display progressive change extension shear fracture morphology
