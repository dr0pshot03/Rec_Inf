flight orientation behaviors promote optimal migration trajectories high-flying insects
many insects undertake long-range seasonal migrations exploit temporary breeding sites hundreds thousands kilometers apart behavioral adaptations facilitate movements remain largely unknown using entomological radar showed ability select seasonally favorable high-altitude winds widespread large day-and night-flying migrants insects adopt optimal flight headings partially correct crosswind drift thus maximizing distances traveled trajectory analyses show behaviors increase migration distances % decrease degree drift seasonally optimal directions flight behaviors match sophistication seen migrant birds help explain high-flying insects migrate successfully seasonal habitats
