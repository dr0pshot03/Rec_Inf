hybrid circuit cavity quantum electrodynamics micromechanical resonator 
hybrid quantum systems inherently distinct degrees freedom key role many physical phenomena well-known examples include cavity quantum electrodynamics trapped ions electrons phonons solid state systems strong coupling makes constituents lose individual character form dressed states represent collective form dynamics well fundamental importance hybrid systems also practical applications notably emerging field quantum information control promising approach combine long-lived atomic states accessible electrical degrees freedom superconducting cavities quantum bits qubits integrate circuit cavity quantum electrodynamics phonons apart coupling microwave cavity superconducting transmon qubit consisting tunnel junctions capacitor interacts phonon mode micromechanical resonator thus acts like atom coupled two different cavities measure phonon stark shift well splitting qubit spectral line motional sidebands feature transitions dressed electromechanical states time domain observe coherent conversion qubit excitation phonons sideband rabi oscillations model system potential quantum interface may allow storage quantum information long-lived phonon states coupling optical photons investigations strongly coupled quantum systems near classical limit
