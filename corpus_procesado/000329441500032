rarity dust metal-poor galaxies 
galaxies observed redshift z> universe less billion years old thus far rarely show evidence- cold dust accompanies star formation local universe dust-to-gas mass ratio around one per cent prototypical example galaxy himiko z which-a mere million years big bang-is forming stars rate solar masses per year yielding mass assembly time x years himiko thought low fraction per cent suns elements heavier helium low metallicity although gas mass yet determined dust-to-stellar mass ratio constrained less per cent local dwarf galaxy zwicky metallicity per cent suns forming stars less rapidly assembly time x years himiko still vigorously mass also dust deficient perhaps one best analogues primitive galaxies accessible detailed study report observations dust emission zw determine dust mass solar masses yielding dust-to-stellar mass ratio - - dust-to-gas mass ratio x - zw reasonable analogue himiko himikos dust mass must around solar masses factor current upper limit numbers quite uncertain high-z galaxies like himiko like very-high-dust-mass galaxy sdss j114816 + z approximate hosts quasar prospects detecting gas dust inside galaxies much poorer hitherto anticipated
