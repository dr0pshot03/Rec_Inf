mammalian neural stem cells
neural stem cells exist developing mammalian nervous system also adult nervous system mammalian organisms including humans neural stem cells can also derived primitive embryonic stem cells location adult stem cells brain regions progeny migrate order differentiate remain unresolved although number viable locations limited adult mechanisms regulate endogenous stem cells poorly understood potential uses stem cells repair include transplantation repair missing cells activation endogenous cells provide self-repair full potential neural stem cells can realized need learn controls proliferation well various pathways differentiation available daughter cells
