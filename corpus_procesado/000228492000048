hypoxia global warming terrestrial late permian extinctions 
catastrophic extinction occurred end permian period however baseline extinction rates appear elevated even final catastrophe suggesting sustained environmental degradation terrestrial vertebrates late permian combination drop atmospheric oxygen plus climate warming induced hypoxic stress consequently compressed altitudinal ranges near sea level simulations suggest magnitude altitudinal compression forced extinctions reducing habitat diversity fragmenting isolating populations inducing species-area effect also might delayed ecosystem recovery mass extinction
