chromosomal translocations critically involved molecular pathogenesis b-cell lymphomas highly recurrent specific rearrangements defined distinct molecular subtypes linked unique clinicopathological features contrast several well-characterized lymphoma entities still lack disease-defining translocation events identify novel fusion transcripts resulting translocations investigated two hodgkin lymphoma cell lines whole-transcriptome paired-end sequencing rna-seq show highly expressed gene fusion involving major histocompatibility complex mhc class ii transactivator ciita mhc2ta km-h2 cells subsequent evaluation b-cell lymphomas also demonstrate genomic ciita breaks highly recurrent primary mediastinal b-cell lymphoma % classical hodgkin lymphoma chl % furthermore find ciita promiscuous partner various in-frame gene fusions report ciita gene alterations impact survival primary mediastinal b-cell lymphoma pmbcl functional consequences ciita gene fusions identify downregulation surface hla class ii expression overexpression ligands receptor molecule programmed cell death cd274/pdl1 cd273/pdl2 receptor-ligand interactions shown impact anti-tumour immune responses several cancers whereas decreased mhc class ii expression linked reduced tumour cell immunogenicity thus findings suggest recurrent rearrangements ciita may represent novel genetic mechanism underlying tumour-microenvironment interactions across spectrum lymphoid cancers
