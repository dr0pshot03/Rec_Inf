fine-scale diversity extensive recombination quasisexual bacterial population occupying broad niche 
extensive fine-scale genetic diversity found many microbial species across varied environments evolutionary scenarios generate observed variation remain unclear deep sequencing thermophilic cyanobacterial population analysis statistics synonymous single-nucleotide polymorphisms revealed high rate homologous recombination departures neutral drift consistent effects genetic hitchhiking sequenced isolate genome resembled unlinked random mixture allelic diversity sampled loci observations suggested quasisexual microbial population occupies broad ecological niche selection driving frequencies alleles rather whole genomes
