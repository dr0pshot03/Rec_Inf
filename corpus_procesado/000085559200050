reduction surface energy liquid interfaces short length scales
liquid-vapour interfaces particularly involving water common natural artificial environments first described regions continuous variation density caused density fluctuations within bulk phases- contrast recent capillary-wave model assumes step-like local density profile across liquid-vapour interface whose width result propagation thermally excited capillary waves model validated length scales tenths micrometres larger structure liquid surfaces submicrometre length scales-where capillary theory expected break down-remains poorly understood report grazing-incidence x-ray scattering experiments allow complete determination free surface structure surface energy water range organic liquids observe large decrease % surface energy submicrometre waves explained capillary theory accord effects arising non-locality attractive intermolecule interactions predicted recent density functional theory data results comparable measurements liquid solutions metallic alloys surfactants lipids wetting films thus provide stringent test new theories attempt describe structure liquid interfaces nanometre-scale resolution
