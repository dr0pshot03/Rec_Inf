atomic-scale imaging carbon nanofibre growth 
synthesis carbon nanotubes predefined structure functionality plays central role field nanotechnology whereas inhibition carbon growth needed prevent breakdown industrial catalysts hydrogen synthesis gas production growth carbon nanotubes nanofibres therefore widely studied- recent advances situ techniques now open possibility studying gas solid interactions atomic level- present time-resolved high-resolution situ transmission electron microscope observations formation carbon nanofibres methane decomposition supported nickel nanocrystals carbon nanofibres observed develop reaction-induced reshaping nickel nanocrystals specifically nucleation growth graphene layers found assisted dynamic formation restructuring mono-atomic step edges nickel surface density-functional theory calculations indicate observations consistent growth mechanism involving surface diffusion carbon nickel atoms finding metallic step edges act spatio-temporal dynamic growth sites may important understanding types catalytic reactions nanomaterial syntheses
