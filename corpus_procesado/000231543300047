molecular mechanism switching p-falciparum invasion pathways human erythrocytes 
malaria parasite plasmodium falciparum exploits multiple ligand-receptor interactions called invasion pathways invade host erythrocyte strains p falciparum vary dependency sialated red cell receptors invasion show switching sialic acid-dependent independent invasion reversible depends parasite ligand use expression p falciparum reticulocyte-binding like homolog pfrh4 correlates sialic acid-independent invasion pfrh4 essential switching invasion pathways differential activation pfrh4 represents previously unknown mechanism switch invasion pathways provides p falciparum exquisite adaptability face erythrocyte receptor polymorphisms host immune responses
