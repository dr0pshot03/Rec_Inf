lethal interactions parasites prey increase niche diversity tropical community 
ecological specialization minimize niche overlap yet herbivorous neotropical flies blepharoneura lethal parasitic wasps parasitoids exhibit extreme specialization apparent niche overlap host plants just two plant species one site peru collected flowers yielding fly pupae representing blepharoneura fly species parasitoid species bellopius species parasitoid-host associations discovered analysis molecular data multiple sympatric species specialize sex flowers fly host-plant species-which suggests extreme niche overlap however niche partitioning exposed interactions wasps flies bellopius species emerged adults one fly species yet evidence pupae preadult emergence samples show bellopius also attacked additional fly species never emerged adults flies
