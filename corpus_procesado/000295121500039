megacity emissions lifetimes nitrogen oxides probed space 
megacities immense sources air pollutants large impacts air quality climate however emission inventories many still highly uncertain particularly developing countries satellite observations allow top-down estimates emissions made nitrogen oxides nox + require poorly quantified priori information nox lifetime present method simultaneous determination megacity nox emissions lifetimes satellite measurements analyzing downwind patterns separately different wind conditions daytime lifetimes similar hours low mid-latitudes similar hours wintertime moscow derived nox emissions generally good agreement existing emission inventories higher factor saudi arabian capital riyadh
