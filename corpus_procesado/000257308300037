asymmetric solar wind termination shock
voyager crossed solar wind termination shock au southern hemisphere au closer sun found voyager north- asymmetry indicate asymmetric pressure interstellar magnetic field transient-induced shock motion solar wind dynamic pressure report intensity mev protons accelerated shock near voyager three times observed concurrently voyager indicating differences shock two locations companion papers report plasma magnetic field plasma wave lower energy particle observations shock voyager find source anomalous cosmic rays shock suggesting source elsewhere shock- heliosheath- small intensity gradient galactic cosmic ray helium indicates either gradient heliosheath local interstellar galactic cosmic ray intensity lower expected
