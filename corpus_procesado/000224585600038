low-voltage organic transistors amorphous molecular gate dielectric
organic thin film transistors tfts interest variety large-area electronic applications displays- sensors electronic barcodes- one key problems existing organic tfts large operating voltage often exceeds v due poor capacitive coupling relatively thick gate dielectric layers: dielectrics usually either inorganic oxides nitrides- insulating polymers often thicker nm minimize gate leakage currents demonstrate manufacturing process tfts -nm-thick molecular self-assembled monolayer sam gate dielectric high-mobility organic semiconductor pentacene tfts operate supply voltages less v yet gate currents lower advanced silicon field-effect transistors sio2 dielectrics results therefore increase prospects using organic tfts low-power applications portable devices moreover molecular sams may even interest advanced silicon transistors continued reduction dielectric thickness leads ever greater gate leakage power dissipation
