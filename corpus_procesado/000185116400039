self-inhibition synthesis antigen presentation epstein-barr virus-encoded ebna1 
glycine-alanine repeat domain gar epstein-barr virus-encoded nuclear antigen ebna1 prevents major histocompatibility complex mhc class restricted presentation ebna1 epitopes cytotoxic t cells effect previously attributed ability gar inhibit proteasomal degradation show vitro vivo gar also inhibits messenger rna translation ebna1 cis effect can distinguished effect proteasomal degradation hence inhibition messenger rna translation protein degradation essential prevent antigen presentation mhc class molecules thus minimizing translation ebna1 transcript cells expressing ebna1 avoid cytotoxic t cell recognition time blocking degradation maintains ebna1 expression level
