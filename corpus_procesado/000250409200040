upper mantle discontinuity topography thermal chemical heterogeneity
using high-resolution stacks precursors seismic phase ss investigated seismic discontinuities associated mineralogical phase changes approximately kilometers km deep within earth beneath south america surrounding oceans detailed maps phase boundary topography revealed deep km discontinuities down-dip direction subduction inconsistent purely isochemical olivine phase transformation response lowered temperatures mechanisms invoking chemical heterogeneity within mantle transition zone explored explain feature regions multiple reflections discontinuities detected consistent partial melt near km depth and/or additional phase changes near km depth thus origin upper mantle heterogeneity chemical thermal contributions associated deeply rooted tectonic processes
