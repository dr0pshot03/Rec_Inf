conformational variations infectious protein determine prion strain differences 
remarkable feature prion biology strain phenomenon wherein prion particles apparently composed protein lead phenotypically distinct transmissible states1- reconcile existence strains protein-only hypothesis prion transmission proposed single protein can misfold multiple distinct infectious forms one different strain1- several studies found correlations strain phenotypes conformations prion particles6-; however whether differences cause simply secondary manifestation prion strains remains unclear largely due difficulty creating infectious material pure protein35 report high-efficiency protocol infecting yeast [psi+] prion using amyloids composed recombinant sup35 fragment sup-nm using thermal stability electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy demonstrate sup-nm amyloids formed different temperatures adopt distinct stably propagating conformations infection yeast different amyloid conformations leads different [psi+] strains results establish sup-nm adopts infectious conformation entering cell fulfilling key prediction prion hypothesis5-and directly demonstrate differences conformation infectious protein determine prion strain variation
