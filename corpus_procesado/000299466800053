asymmetric segregation polarized antigen b cell division shapes presentation capacity 
activation humoral immune responses b cells acquire antigen subsequent presentation cognate t cells show mouse b cells accumulate antigen maintained polarized distribution extended periods vivo using high-throughput imaging flow cytometry observed polarization preserved b cell division promoting asymmetric antigen segregation among progeny antigen inheritance correlates ability progeny activate t cells: daughter cells receiving larger antigen stores exhibit prolonged capacity present antigen renders effective competing t cell help generation progeny differential capacities antigen presentation may implications somatic hypermutation class switching affinity maturation b cells commit effector cell fates
