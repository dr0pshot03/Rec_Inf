labeling active neural circuits vivo designed calcium integrators
identification active neurons circuits vivo fundamental challenge understanding neural basis behavior genetically encoded calcium ca2+ indicators gecis enable quantitative monitoring cellular-resolution activity behavior however indicators require online monitoring within limited field view alternatively post hoc staining immediate early genes iegs indicates highly active cells within entire brain albeit poor temporal resolution designed fluorescent sensor campari combines genetic targetability quantitative link neural activity gecis permanent large-scale labeling iegs allowing temporally precise activity snapshot large tissue volume campari undergoes efficient irreversible green-to-red conversion elevated intracellular ca2+ experimenter-controlled illumination coincide demonstrate utility campari freely moving larvae zebrafish flies head-fixed mice adult flies
