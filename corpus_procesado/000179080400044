fatigue failure polysilicon due simple stress corrosion cracking 
absence corrosive environment brittle materials silicon immune cyclic fatigue however fatigue effects well known micrometer-sized polycrystalline silicon polysilicon samples tested air investigate origins phenomenon polysilicon developed fixed-grip fracture mechanics microspecimen find evidence static stress corrosion cracking environmental sensitivity fatigue resistance also investigated cyclic loading low-cycle fatigue behavior independent ambient conditions whether air vacuum strongly influenced ratio compressive tensile stresses experienced cycle fatigue damage likely originates contact stresses processing-related surface asperities subcritical crack growth ensues cyclic loading lower far-field stresses involved high-cycle fatigue induce reduced levels fatigue damage conditions corrosive ambient laboratory air exacerbates fatigue process without cyclic loading polysilicon undergo stress corrosion cracking
