algae acquire vitamin b symbiotic relationship bacteria 
vitamin b cobalamin identified nearly years ago anti pernicious anaemia factor liver importance human health disease resulted much work uptake cellular transport utilization plants contain cobalamin cobalamin-dependent enzymes deficiencies therefore common strict vegetarians elderly susceptible autoimmune disorder prevents efficient uptake contrast many algae rich vitamin b- species porphyra yezoensis nori containing much cobalamin liver despite role cofactor algal metabolism remains unknown source vitamin organisms survey algal species revealed species require exogenous vitamin b growth implying half algal kingdom cobalamin auxotrophs show role vitamin b algal metabolism primarily cofactor vitamin b--dependent methionine synthase cobalamin auxotrophy arisen numerous times throughout evolution probably owing loss vitamin b--independent form enzyme source cobalamin seems bacteria indicating important unsuspected symbiosis
