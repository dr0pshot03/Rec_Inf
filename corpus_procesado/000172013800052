interaction response regulator arr4 phytochrome b modulating red light signaling 
arabidopsis thaliana response regulator expressed response phytochrome b action specifically interacts extreme amino-terminus photoreceptor response regulator stabilizes active pfr form phytochrome b yeast planta thus elevates level active photoreceptor vivo accordingly transgenic arabidopsis plants overexpressing response regulator display hypersensitivity red tight light wavelengths propose response regulator acts output element two-component system modulates red light signaling level phytochrome b photoreceptor
