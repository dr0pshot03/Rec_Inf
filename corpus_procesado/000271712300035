strain-driven morphotropic phase boundary bifeo3 
piezoelectric materials convert mechanical electrical energy vice versa typically characterized intimate coexistence two phases across morphotropic phase boundary electrically switching one yields large electromechanical coupling coefficients driven global environmental concerns currently strong push discover practical lead-free piezoelectrics device engineering using combination epitaxial growth techniques conjunction theoretical approaches show formation morphotropic phase boundary epitaxial constraint lead-free piezoelectric bismuth ferrite bifeo3 films electric field-dependent studies show tetragonal-like phase can reversibly converted rhombohedral-like phase accompanied measurable displacements surface making new lead-free system interest probe-based data storage actuator applications
