culling prey promotes predator recovery alternative states whole-lake experiment 
many top-predator fish stocks freshwater marine systems collapsed result overharvesting consequently communities shifted seemingly irreversible new states showed predators feeding prey exhibit food-dependent growth culling fish prey may promote predator recovery removed old stunted individuals prey-fish species large low-productive lake caused increase availability small-sized prey allowed predator recover shift community state sustained years cull ended represents experimental demonstration alternative stable state large-scale field system animals exhibit food-dependent growth shifts alternative stable states resulting overcompensating prey growth may common nature may require counterintuitive management strategies
