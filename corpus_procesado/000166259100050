chromosomal effects rapid gene evolution drosophila melanogaster 
rapid adaptive fixation new favorable mutation expected affect neighboring genes along chromosome evolutionary theory predicts chromosomal region show reduced level genetic variation excess rare alleles confirmed predictions region x chromosome drosophila melanogaster contains newly evolved gene far component sperm axoneme d simulans novel gene exist pattern genetic variation consistent selection recurrent deleterious mutations findings imply pattern genetic variation along chromosome may useful inferring evolutionary history revealing regions recent adaptive fixations taken place
