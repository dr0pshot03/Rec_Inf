evolutionary origins vertebrate appendicular muscle 
evolution terrestrial tetrapod species heralded transition locomotor strategies fish species use undulating contractions axial musculature generate propulsive force tetrapods also rely appendicular muscles limbs generate movement12 despite fossil record generating understanding way appendicular skeleton evolved provide scaffold tetrapod limb musculature3 contrast almost information musculature arose examine fin muscle formation within two extant classes fish find teleost zebrafish fin muscles arise migratory mesenchymal precursor cells possess molecular morphogenetic identity limb muscle precursors tetrapod species chondrichthyan dogfish embryos however use primitive mechanism direct epithelial somitic extensions derive muscles fin conclude genetic mechanism controlling formation tetrapod limb muscles evolved sarcopterygian radiation
