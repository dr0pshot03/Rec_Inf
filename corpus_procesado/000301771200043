megf10 megf11 mediate homotypic interactions required mosaic spacing retinal neurons 
many parts nervous system neuronal somata display orderly spatial arrangements retina neurons numerous individual subtypes form regular arrays called mosaics: less likely near neighbours subtype occur chance resulting exclusion zones separate them- mosaic arrangements provide mechanism distribute cell type evenly across retina ensuring parts visual field access full set processing elements remarkably mosaics independent other: although neuron one subtype unlikely adjacent another subtype restriction spatial relationship neighbouring neurons subtypes independence led hypothesis molecular cues expressed specific subtypes pattern mosaics mediating homotypic within-subtype short-range repulsive interactions- far however molecules identified show activity hypothesis remains untested demonstrate mouse two related transmembrane proteins megf10 megf11 critical roles formation mosaics two retinal interneuron subtypes starburst amacrine cells horizontal cells megf10 invertebrate relatives caenorhabditis elegans ced drosophila draper hitherto studied primarily receptors necessary engulfment debris following apoptosis axonal injury- results demonstrate members gene family can also serve subtype-specific ligands pattern neuronal arrays
