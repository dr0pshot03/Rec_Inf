whole-cell patch-clamp measurements spermatozoa reveal alkaline-activated ca2+ channel
mammals sperm cells become motile ejaculation swim female reproductive tract fertilization overcome various barriers motility must hyperactivated motion characterized vigorous asymmetric tail beating hyperactivation requires increase calcium flagella process probably involves plasmalemmal ion channels- numerous attempts past two decades understand sperm cell channels frustrated difficulty measuring spermatozoan transmembrane ion currents using simple approach patch-clamp spermatozoa characterize whole-spermatozoan currents describe constitutively active flagellar calcium channel strongly potentiated intracellular alkalinization current present spermatozoa lacking sperm-specific putative ion channel protein catsper1 plasma membrane protein six transmembrane-spanning ion channel superfamily specifically localized principal piece sperm tail required sperm cell hyperactivation male fertility results identify catsper1 component key flagellar calcium channel suggest intracellular alkalinization potentiates catsper current increase intraflagellar calcium induce sperm hyperactivation
