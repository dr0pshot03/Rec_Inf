transgenerational epigenetic inheritance longevity caenorhabditis elegans
chromatin modifiers regulate lifespan several organisms raising question whether changes chromatin states parental generation incompletely reprogrammed next generation thereby affect lifespan descendants histone h3 lysine trimethylation h3k4me3 complex composed ash- wdr histone methyltransferase set- regulates caenorhabditis elegans lifespan show deficiencies h3k4me3 chromatin modifiers ash- wdr set parental generation extend lifespan descendants third generation transgenerational inheritance lifespan extension members ash complex dependent h3k4me3 demethylase rbr- requires presence functioning germline descendants transgenerational inheritance lifespan specific h3k4me3 methylation complex associated epigenetic changes gene expression thus manipulation specific chromatin modifiers parents can induce epigenetic memory longevity descendants
