colloidal quantum dot spectrometer
spectroscopy carried almost every field science whenever light interacts matter although sophisticated instruments impressive performance characteristics available much effort continues invested development miniaturized cheap easy-to-use systems- current microspectrometer designs mostly use interference filters- interferometric optics limit photon efficiency resolution spectral range show many limitations can overcome replacing interferometric optics two-dimensional absorptive filter array composed colloidal quantum dots- instead measuring different bands spectrum individually introducing temporal spatial separations gratings interference-based narrow-band filters colloidal quantum dot spectrometer measures light spectrum based wavelength multiplexing principle: multiple spectral bands encoded detected simultaneously one filter one detector- respectively array format allowing process efficiently repeated many times using different filters different encoding sufficient information obtained enable computational reconstruction target spectrum illustrate performance quantum dot microspectrometer made different types quantum dots absorption features cover spectral range nanometres measuring shifts spectral peak positions small one nanometre given performance demonstrable avenues improvement ease quantum dots can processed integrated numerous finely tuneable bandgaps cover broad spectral range expect quantum dot micro-spectrometers will useful applications minimizing size weight cost complexity spectrometer critical
