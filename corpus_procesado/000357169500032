colloidal quantum dot spectrometer 
spectroscopy carried almost every field science whenever light interacts matter1 although sophisticated instruments impressive performance characteristics available much effort continues invested development miniaturized cheap easy-to-use systems1- current microspectrometer designs mostly use interference filters2- interferometric optics3 limit photon efficiency resolution spectral range23 show many limitations can overcome replacing interferometric optics two-dimensional absorptive filter array composed colloidal quantum dots14- instead measuring different bands spectrum individually introducing temporal spatial separations gratings interference-based narrow-band filters colloidal quantum dot spectrometer measures light spectrum based wavelength multiplexing principle18: multiple spectral bands encoded detected simultaneously one filter one detector9- respectively array format allowing process efficiently repeated many times using different filters different encoding sufficient information obtained enable computational reconstruction target spectrum illustrate performance quantum dot microspectrometer made different types quantum dots absorption features cover spectral range nanometres measuring shifts spectral peak positions small one nanometre given performance demonstrable avenues improvement ease quantum dots can processed integrated numerous finely tuneable bandgaps cover broad spectral range expect quantum dot micro-spectrometers will useful applications minimizing size weight cost complexity spectrometer critical
