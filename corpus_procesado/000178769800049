prolyl isomerase pin1 regulator p53 genotoxic response 
p53 activated response various genotoxic stresses resulting cell cycle arrest apoptosis well documented dna damage leads phosphorylation activation p53 refs yet p53 activated still fully understood report dna damage specifically induces p53 phosphorylation ser/thr-pro motifs facilitates interaction pin1 member peptidyl-prolyl isomerase- furthermore interaction pin1 p53 dependent phosphorylation induced dna damage consequently pin1 stimulates dna-binding activity transactivation function p53 pin1-mediated p53 activation requires ww domain phosphorylated ser/thr-pro motif interaction module isomerase activity pin1 moreover pin1-deficient cells defective p53 activation timely accumulation p53 protein exhibit impaired checkpoint control response dna damage together data suggest mechanism p53 regulation cellular response genotoxic stress
