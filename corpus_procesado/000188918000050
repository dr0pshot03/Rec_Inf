cdh1-apc controls axonal growth patterning mammalian brain 
anaphase-promoting complex apc highly expressed postmitotic neurons function nervous system previously unknown report inhibition cdh1-apc primary neurons specifically enhanced axonal growth cdh1 knockdown cerebellar slice overlay assays developing rat cerebellum vivo revealed cell-autonomous abnormalities layer-specific growth granule neuron axons parallel fiber patterning cdh1 rna interference neurons also found override inhibitory influence myelin axonal growth thus cdh1-apc appears play role regulating axonal growth patterning developing brain may also limit growth injured axons adult brain
