remote control therapeutic t cells small molecule-gated chimeric receptor 
growing interest using engineered cells therapeutic agents example synthetic chimeric antigen receptors cars can redirect t cells recognize eliminate tumor cells expressing specific antigens despite promising clinical results engineered t cells can exhibit excessive activity difficult control can cause severe toxicity designed "on-switch" cars enable small-molecule control t cell therapeutic functions still retaining antigen specificity split receptors antigen-binding intracellular signaling components assemble presence heterodimerizing small molecule titratable pharmacologic regulation allow physicians precisely control timing location dosage t cell activity thereby mitigating toxicity work illustrates potential combining cellular engineering orthogonal chemical tools yield safer therapeutic cells tightly integrate cell-autonomous recognition user control
