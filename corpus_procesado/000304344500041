warming experiments underpredict plant phenological responses climate change 
warming experiments increasingly relied estimate plant responses global climate change12 experiments provide meaningful predictions future responses reflect empirical record responses temperature variability recent warming including advances timing flowering leafing3- compared phenology timing recurring life history events observational studies warming experiments spanning four continents plant species using common measure temperature sensitivity change days per degree celsius show warming experiments underpredict advances timing flowering leafing -fold -fold respectively compared long-term observations species common study types experimental results match observational data sign magnitude observational data also showed species flower earliest spring highest temperature sensitivities trend reflected experimental data significant mismatches seem unrelated study length degree manipulated warming experiments discrepancy experiments observations however arise complex interactions among multiple drivers observational data arise remediable artefacts experiments result lower irradiance drier soils thus dampening phenological responses manipulated warming results introduce uncertainty ecosystem models informed solely experiments suggest responses climate change predicted using models re-evaluated
