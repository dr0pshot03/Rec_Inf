resolved outflow matter brown dwarf 
birth stars involves accretion also counterintuitively expulsion matter form highly supersonic outflows although phenomenon seen young stars fundamental question whether also occurs among newborn brown dwarfs: so-called failed stars masses stars planets never manage reach temperatures high enough normal hydrogen fusion occur recently evidence accretion young brown dwarfs mounted- spectra show lines suggestive outflows- report spectro-astrometric data spatially resolve outflow brown dwarf outflows characteristics appear similar smaller scale outflows normal young stars result suggests outflow mechanism universal perhaps relevant even formation planets
