continuous liquid interface production 3d objects 
additive manufacturing processes 3d printing use time-consuming stepwise layer-by-layer approaches object fabrication demonstrate continuous generation monolithic polymeric parts tens centimeters size feature resolution micrometers continuous liquid interface production achieved oxygen-permeable window ultraviolet image projection plane creates "dead zone" persistent liquid interface photopolymerization inhibited window polymerizing part delineate critical control parameters show complex solid parts can drawn resin rates hundreds millimeters per hour print speeds allow parts produced minutes instead hours
