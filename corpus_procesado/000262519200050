pulsed contractions actin-myosin network drive apical constriction 
apical constriction facilitates epithelial sheet bending invagination morphogenesis apical constriction conventionally thought driven continuous purse string like contraction circumferential actin non muscle myosin ii myosin belt underlying adherens junctions- however unclear whether force generating mechanisms can drive process show use real time imaging quantitative image analysis drosophila gastrulation apical constriction ventral furrow cells pulsed repeated constrictions asynchronous neighbouring cells interrupted pauses constricted state cell apex maintained contrast purse string model constriction pulses powered actin myosin network contractions occur medial apical cortex pull discrete adherens junction sites inwards transcription factors twist snail differentially regulate pulsed constriction expression snail initiates actin myosin network contractions whereas expression twist stabilizes constricted state cell apex results suggest new model apical constriction cortical actin myosin cytoskeleton functions developmentally controlled subcellular ratchet reduce apical area incrementally
