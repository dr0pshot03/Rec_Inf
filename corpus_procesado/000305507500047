airborne transmission influenza a/h5n1 virus ferrets 
highly pathogenic avian influenza a/h5n1 virus can cause morbidity mortality humans thus far acquired ability transmitted aerosol respiratory droplet airborne transmission humans address concern virus acquire ability natural conditions genetically modified a/h5n1 virus site-directed mutagenesis subsequent serial passage ferrets genetically modified a/h5n1 virus acquired mutations passage ferrets ultimately becoming airborne transmissible ferrets none recipient ferrets died airborne infection mutant a/h5n1 viruses four amino acid substitutions host receptor-binding protein hemagglutinin one polymerase complex protein basic polymerase consistently present airborne-transmitted viruses transmissible viruses sensitive antiviral drug oseltamivir reacted well antisera raised h5 influenza vaccine strains thus avian a/h5n1 influenza viruses can acquire capacity airborne transmission mammals without recombination intermediate host therefore constitute risk human pandemic influenza
