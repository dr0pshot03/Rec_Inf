smedwi- piwi-like protein regulates planarian stem cells 
identified two genes smedwi- smedwi- expressed dividing adult stem cells neoblasts planarian schmidtea mediterranea genes encode proteins belong argonaute/piwi protein family share highest homology proteins defined drosophila piwi rna interference rnai smedwi- blocks regeneration even though neoblasts present irradiation-sensitive capable proliferating response wounding; smedwi-2rnai neoblast progeny migrate sites cell turnover unlike normal cells fail replacing aged tissue suggest smedwi- functions within dividing neoblasts support generation cells promote regeneration homeostasis
