density triggers maternal hormones increase adaptive offspring growth wild mammal
fluctuating environments mothers may enhance fitness offspring adjusting offspring phenotypes match environment will experience independence free-ranging red squirrels natural selection offspring postnatal growth rates varies according population density selection favoring faster-growing offspring high-density conditions show exposing mothers high-density cues accomplished via playbacks territorial vocalizations led increased offspring growth rates absence additional food resources experimental elevation actual perceived density induced higher maternal glucocorticoid levels females naturally experimentally increased glucocorticoids produced offspring grew faster controls therefore social cues reflecting population density sufficient elicit increased offspring growth adaptive hormone-mediated maternal effect
