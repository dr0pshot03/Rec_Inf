subnoise detection fast random event
observation random nonrepetitive phenomena critical importance astronomy spectroscopy biology remote sensing heralded weak signals hidden noise pose basic detection challenges contrast repetitive waveforms single-instance signal separated noise averaging show fast randomly occurring event can detected extracted noisy background without conventional averaging isolated picosecond pulse received confidence level exceeding % even accompanied noise detector relies instantaneous spectral cloning single-step coherent field processor ability extract fast subnoise events expected increase detection sensitivity multiple disciplines additionally new spectral-cloning receiver can potentially intercept communication signals presently considered secure
