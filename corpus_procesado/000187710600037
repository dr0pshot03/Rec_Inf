partitioning energetics walking running: swinging limbs expensive
explaining energetics walking running difficult distribution energy use among individual muscles known estimated energy use measuring blood flow hindlimb muscles guinea fowl blood flow skeletal muscles controlled locally varies directly metabolic rate estimate swing-phase muscles consume % energy used limbs stance-phase muscles consume remaining % independent speed thus contrary previous suggestions swinging limbs requires appreciable fraction energy used terrestrial legged locomotion models integrating energetics mechanics running will benefit detailed information distribution energy use muscles
