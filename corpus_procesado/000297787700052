perceived predation risk reduces number offspring songbirds produce per year 
predator effects prey demography traditionally ascribed solely direct killing studies population ecology wildlife management predators also affect preys perception predation risk thought meaningfully affect prey demography isolated effects perceived predation risk free-living population song sparrows actively eliminating direct predation used playbacks predator calls sounds manipulate perceived risk found perception predation risk alone reduced number offspring produced per year % results suggest perception predation risk powerful enough affect wildlife population dynamics thus given greater consideration vertebrate conservation management
