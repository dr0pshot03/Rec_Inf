images asteroid lutetia: remnant planetesimal early solar system 
images obtained optical spectroscopic infrared remote imaging system osiris cameras onboard rosetta spacecraft reveal asteroid lutetia complex geology one highest asteroid densities measured far +/ grams per cubic centimeter north pole region covered thick layer regolith seen flow major landslides associated albedo variation geologically complex surface ancient surface age high density suggest lutetia likely primordial planetesimal contrasts smaller asteroids visited previous spacecraft probably shattered bodies fragments larger parents reaccumulated rubble piles
