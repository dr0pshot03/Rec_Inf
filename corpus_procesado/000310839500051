mitochondrial network size scaling budding yeast
mitochondria must grow growing cell ensure proper cellular physiology inheritance upon division measured physical size mitochondrial networks budding yeast found mitochondrial network size increased increasing cell size scaling relation occurred primarily bud mitochondria-to-cell size ratio continually decreased aging mothers successive generations however regardless mothers age mitochondrial content buds attained average ratio thus yeast populations achieve stable scaling relation mitochondrial content cell size despite asymmetry inheritance
