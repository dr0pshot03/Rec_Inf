genetic contributions stability change intelligence childhood old age
understanding determinants healthy mental ageing priority society today far know intelligence differences show high stability childhood old age estimates genetic contribution intelligence different ages however attempts discover whether genetic causes contribute differences cognitive ageing relatively uninformative- provide estimate genetic environmental contributions stability change intelligence across human lifetime used genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism snp data unrelated individuals whose intelligence measured childhood age years old age age years use statistical method allows genetic covariance estimated snp data unrelated individuals- estimate causal genetic variants linkage disequilibrium common snps account variation cognitive ability change childhood old age using bivariate analysis estimate genetic correlation intelligence age years old age estimates derived rarely available data lifetime cognitive measures warrant search genetic causes cognitive stability change
