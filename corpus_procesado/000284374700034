uncertainty principle determines nonlocality quantum mechanics 
two central concepts quantum mechanics heisenbergs uncertainty principle subtle form nonlocality einstein famously called "spooky action distance" two fundamental features thus far distinct concepts show inextricably quantitatively linked: quantum mechanics nonlocal measurements respect uncertainty principle fact link uncertainty nonlocality holds physical theories specifically degree nonlocality theory determined two factors: strength uncertainty principle strength property called "steering" determines states can prepared one location given measurement another
