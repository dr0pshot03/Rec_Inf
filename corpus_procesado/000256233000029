mars north polar deposits: stratigraphy age geodynamical response
shallow radar sharad mars reconnaissance orbiter imaged internal stratigraphy north polar layered deposits mars radar reflections within deposits reveal laterally continuous deposition layers typically consist four packets finely spaced reflectors separated homogeneous interpacket regions nearly pure ice packet/ interpacket structure can explained approximately million year periodicities mars obliquity orbital eccentricity observed similar meter maximum deflection underlying substrate response ice load implies present day thickness equilibrium elastic lithosphere greater kilometers alternatively response load may transient state controlled mantle viscosity scenarios probably require mars subchondritic abundance heat producing elements
