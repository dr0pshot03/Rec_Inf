observing brownian motion vibration-fluidized granular matter
observation rotational brownian motion fine wire immersed gas led one important ideas equilibrium statistical mechanics namely many-particle problem large number molecules colliding wire can represented just two macroscopic parameters: viscosity temperature interest arisen question whether idea mathematically developed langevin model fluctuation-dissipation theorem can also used describe systems far equilibrium report experimental investigation archetypal non-equilibrium system involving sensitive torsion oscillator immersed granular system millimetre-size grains fluidized strong external vibrations vibro-fluidized granular medium driven environment continuous injection dissipation energy immersed oscillator can seen analogous elastically bound brownian particle measuring noise susceptibility show experiment can treated first approximation equilibrium formalism gives experimental access granular viscosity effective temperature however quantities anisotropic inhomogeneous surprisingly vibrofluidized granular matter behaves thermal bath satisfying fluctuation-dissipation relation
