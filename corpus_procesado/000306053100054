recurrent hemizygous deletions cancers may optimize proliferative potential 
tumors exhibit numerous recurrent hemizygous focal deletions contain known tumor suppressors poorly understood investigate whether regions contribute tumorigenesis searched genetically genes cancer-relevant properties within hemizygous deletions identified stop go genes negatively positively regulate proliferation respectively stop genes include many known tumor suppressors whereas go genes enriched essential genes analysis chromosomal distribution revealed recurring deletions preferentially overrepresent stop genes underrepresent go genes propose hypothesis called cancer gene island model whereby gene islands encompassing high densities stop genes low densities go genes hemizygously deleted maximize proliferative fitness cumulative haploinsufficiencies hundreds thousands genes hemizygously deleted per tumor mechanism may help drive tumorigenesis across many cancer types
