sumoylation regulates kainate-receptor-mediated synaptic transmission
small ubiquitin-like modifier protein sumo regulates transcriptional activity translocation proteins across nuclear membrane identification sumo substrates outside nucleus progressing little yet known wider cellular role protein sumoylation report rat hippocampal neurons multiple sumoylation targets present synapses show kainate receptor subunit glur6 sumo substrate sumoylation glur6 regulates endocytosis kainate receptor modifies synaptic transmission glur6 exhibits low levels sumoylation resting conditions rapidly sumoylated response kainate n-methyl-d-aspartate nmda treatment reducing glur6 sumoylation using sumo-specific isopeptidase senp1 prevents kainate-evoked endocytosis kainate receptor furthermore mutated non-sumoylatable form glur6 endocytosed response kainate cos cells consistent electrophysiological recordings hippocampal slices demonstrate kainate-receptor-mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents decreased sumoylation enhanced desumoylation data reveal previously unsuspected role sumo regulation synaptic function
