permanent el nino-like conditions pliocene warm period
warm early pliocene similar million years ago recent interval climate warmer today eastern pacific thermocline deep average west-to-east sea surface temperature difference across equatorial pacific +/ degrees c much like modern el nino event thus modern strong sea surface temperature gradient across equatorial pacific stable permanent feature sustained el nino-like conditions including relatively weak zonal atmospheric walker circulation consequence play important role determining global warmth
