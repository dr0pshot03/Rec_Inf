inverse transition magnetic domain patterns ultrathin films 
inverse freezing inverse melting processes symmetric phase found lower temperatures higher temperatures inverse transitions rare report existence inverse transition effect ultrathin fe films magnetized perpendicular film plane magnetization films uniform instead manifests stripe domains opposite perpendicular magnetization- predictions relating disordering striped ground state limit monolayer film thicknesses controversial mean-field arguments- predict continuous reduction stripe width temperature increased studies- suggest topological defects dislocations disclinations might penetrate system induce geometrical phase transitions find scanning electron microscopy imaging temperature increased low-temperature stripe domain structure transforms symmetric labyrinthine structure however even higher temperatures loss magnetic order re-occurrence less symmetric stripe phase found despite widespread theoretical experimental work striped systems phase sequence microscopic instabilities driving observed
