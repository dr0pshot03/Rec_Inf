intrinsic motions along enzymatic reaction trajectory
mechanisms enzymes achieve extraordinary rate acceleration specificity long key interest biochemistry generally recognized substrate binding coupled conformational changes substrate enzyme complex aligns reactive groups optimal environment efficient chemistry although chemical mechanisms elucidated many enzymes question enzymes achieve catalytically competent state recently become approachable experiment computation show crystallographic evidence conformational substates along trajectory towards catalytically competent closed state ligand free form enzyme adenylate kinase molecular dynamics simulations indicate partially closed conformations sampled nanoseconds whereas nuclear magnetic resonance single molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer reveal rare sampling fully closed conformation occurring microsecond millisecond timescale thus larger scale motions substrate free adenylate kinase random preferentially follow pathways create configuration capable proficient chemistry preferred directionality encoded fold may contribute catalysis many enzymes
