strigolactone inhibition shoot branching 
carotenoid derived hormonal signal inhibits shoot branching plants long escaped identification strigolactones compounds thought derived carotenoids known trigger germination parasitic plant seeds stimulate symbiotic fungi present evidence carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase shoot branching mutants pea strigolactone deficient strigolactone application restores wild type branching phenotype ccd8 mutants moreover show branching mutants previously characterized lacking response branching inhibition signal also lack strigolactone response deficient strigolactones responses conserved arabidopsis agreement expected properties hormonal signal exogenous strigolactone can transported shoots act low concentrations suggest endogenous strigolactones related compounds inhibit shoot branching plants furthermore ccd8 mutants demonstrate diverse effects strigolactones shoot branching mycorrhizal symbiosis parasitic weed interaction
