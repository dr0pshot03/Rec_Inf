gefitinib-sensitizing egfr mutations lung cancer activate anti-apoptotic pathways 
gefitinib iressa astrazeneca pharmaceuticals tyrosine kinase inhibitor targets epidermal growth factor receptor egfr induces dramatic clinical responses nonsmall cell lung cancers nsclcs activating mutations within egfr kinase domain report mutant egfrs selectively activate akt signal transduction activator transcription stat signaling pathways promote cell survival effect extracellular signal-regulated kinase signaling induces proliferation nsclc cells expressing mutant egfrs underwent extensive apoptosis small interfering rna-mediated knockdown mutant egfr treatment pharmacological inhibitors akt stat signaling relatively resistant apoptosis induced conventional chemotherapeutic drugs thus mutant egfrs selectively transduce survival signals nsclcs become dependent inhibition signals gefitinib may contribute drugs efficacy
