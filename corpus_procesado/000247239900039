brain processing depends interactions neuronal groups interactions governed pattern anatomical connections yet unknown mechanisms modulate effective strength given connection found mutual influence among neuronal groups depends phase relation rhythmic activities within groups phase relations supporting interactions groups preceded interactions milliseconds consistent mechanistic role effects specific time frequency space therefore propose pattern synchronization flexibly determines pattern neuronal interactions
