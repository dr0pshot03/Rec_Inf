inhibition prostaglandin-degrading enzyme pgdh potentiates tissue regeneration 
agents promote tissue regeneration beneficial variety clinical settings stimulating recovery hematopoietic system bone marrow transplantation prostaglandin pge2 lipid signaling molecule supports expansion several types tissue stem cells candidate therapeutic target promoting tissue regeneration vivo show inhibition hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase -pgdh prostaglandin-degrading enzyme potentiates tissue regeneration multiple organs mice chemical screen identify small-molecule inhibitor pgdh sw033291 increases prostaglandin pge2 levels bone marrow tissues sw033291 accelerates hematopoietic recovery mice receiving bone marrow transplant compound also promotes tissue regeneration mouse models colon liver injury tissues pgdh knockout mice demonstrate similar increased regenerative capacity thus pgdh inhibition may valuable therapeutic strategy tissue regeneration diverse clinical contexts
