gate-variable optical transitions graphene
two-dimensional graphene monolayers bilayers exhibit fascinating electrical transport behaviors using infrared spectroscopy find also strong interband transitions optical transitions can substantially modified electrical gating much like electrical transport field-effect transistors gate dependence interband transitions adds valuable dimension optically probing graphene band structure graphene monolayer yields directly linear band dispersion dirac fermions whereas bilayer reveals dominating van hove singularity arising interlayer coupling strong layer-dependent optical transitions graphene tunability simple electrical gating hold promise new applications infrared optics optoelectronics
