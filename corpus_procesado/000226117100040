vitamin c degradation plant cells via enzymatic hydrolysis o-oxalyl-l-threonate
increasing l-ascorbate vitamin c content crops principle involve promoting biosynthesis inhibiting degradation recent progress revealed biosynthetic pathways ascorbate- degradative pathways remain unclear elucidation pathways promote understanding roles ascorbate plants especially intriguing positive correlation growth rate ascorbate oxidase products plants vitaceae ascorbate degraded via l-idonate l-threarate l-tartrate latter arising carbons ascorbate- plants however including vitaceae ascorbate degradation can occur via dehydroascorbate yielding oxalate plus l-threonate latter carbons ascorbate metabolic steps ascorbate oxalate/l-threonate subcellular location unknown show pathway operates extracellularly cultured rosa cells proceeds via several novel intermediates including o-oxalyl-l-threonate involves least one new enzyme activity pathway can also operate non-enzymatically potentially accounting vitamin losses cooking several steps pathway may generate peroxide may contribute role ascorbate pro-oxidant potentially capable loosening plant cell wall and/or triggering oxidative burst
