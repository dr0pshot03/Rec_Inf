photon-induced kondo satellites single-electron transistor 
measure differential conductance single-electron transistor set irradiated microwaves spin-entangled many-electron kondo state produces zero-bias peakin dc differential conductance quantum dot set contains unpaired electron photon energy hf comparable energy width kondo peak e charge electron times microwave voltage across dot satellites appear differential conductance shifted voltage +/-hf/e zero-bias resonance also observe overall suppression kondo features increasing microwave voltage
