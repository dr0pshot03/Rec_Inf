psd- involvement maturation excitatory synapses 
psd- neuronal pdz protein associates receptors cytoskeletal elements synapses whose function uncertain found overexpression psd- hippocampal neurons can drive maturation glutamatergic synapses psd- expression enhanced postsynaptic clustering activity glutamate receptors postsynaptic expression psd- also enhanced maturation presynaptic terminal effects required synaptic clustering psd- rely guanylate kinase domain psd- expression also increased number size dendritic spines results demonstrate psd- can orchestrate synaptic development suggestive roles psd- synapse stabilization plasticity
