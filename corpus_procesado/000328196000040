genome ctenophore mnemiopsis leidyi implications cell type evolution 
understanding ctenophore biology critical reconstructing events occurred early animal evolution toward goal sequenced assembled annotated genome ctenophore mnemiopsis leidyi phylogenomic analyses amino acid positions gene content suggest ctenophores rather sponges sister lineage animals mnemiopsis lacks many genes found bilaterian mesodermal cell types suggesting cell types evolved independently set neural genes mnemiopsis similar sponges indicating sponges may lost nervous system results present newly supported view early animal evolution accounts major losses and/or gains sophisticated cell types including nerve muscle cells
