defective tryptophan catabolism underlies inflammation mouse chronic granulomatous disease
half century ago chronic granulomatous disease cgd first described disease fatally affecting ability children survive infections various milestone discoveries since made insufficient ability patients leucocytes kill microbes underlying genetic abnormalities inherited disorder phagocytes lack nadph oxidase activity generate reactive oxygen species notably superoxide anion causing recurrent bacterial fungal infections patients cgd also suffer chronic inflammatory conditions prominently granuloma formation hollow viscera precise mechanisms increased microbial pathogenicity unclear reasons exaggerated inflammatory response- show superoxide dependent step tryptophan metabolism along kynurenine pathway blocked cgd mice lethal pulmonary aspergillosis leading unrestrained v gamma + gamma delta t cell reactivity dominant production interleukin il defective regulatory t cell activity acute inflammatory lung injury although beneficial effects induced il neutralization gamma delta t cell contraction complete cure reversal hyperinflammatory phenotype achieved replacement therapy natural kynurenine distal blockade pathway effective therapy includes co-administration recombinant interferon-gamma ifn-gamma restores production downstream immunoactive metabolites enables emergence regulatory v gamma + gamma delta foxp3+ alpha beta t cells therefore paradoxically lack reactive oxygen species contributes hyperinflammatory phenotype associated nadph oxidase deficiencies dysfunctional kynurenine pathway tryptophan catabolism yet condition can reverted reactivating pathway downstream superoxide dependent step
