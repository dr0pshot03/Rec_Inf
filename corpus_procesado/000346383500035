genome-wide characterization routes pluripotency 
somatic cell reprogramming pluripotent state continues challenge many assumptions cellular specification despite major efforts lack complete molecular characterization reprograming process address gap knowledge generated extensive transcriptomic epigenomic proteomic data sets describing reprogramming routes leading mouse embryonic fibroblasts induced pluripotency integrative analysis reveal cells transition distinct gene expression epigenetic signatures bifurcate towards reprogramming transgene-dependent independent stable pluripotent states early transcriptional events driven high levels reprogramming transcription factor expression associated widespread loss histone h3 lysine h3k27me3 trimethylation representing general opening chromatin state maintenance high transgene levels leads re-acquisition h3k27me3 stable pluripotent state alternative embryonic stem cell esc-like fate lowering transgene levels intermediate phase however guides process acquisition esc-like chromatin dna methylation signature data provide comprehensive molecular description reprogramming routes accessible project grandiose portal http://wwwstemformaticsorg
