addition human melanopsin renders mammalian cells photoresponsive
small number mammalian retinal ganglion cells act photoreceptors regulating certain non-image forming photoresponses- intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells express putative photopigment melanopsin- ablation melanopsin gene renders cells insensitive light however precise role melanopsin supporting cellular photosensitivity unconfirmed show heterologous expression human melanopsin mouse paraneuronal cell line neuro-2a sufficient render cells photoreceptive conditions melanopsin acts sensory photopigment coupled native ion channel via g-protein signalling cascade drive physiological light detection melanopsin photoresponse relies presence cis-isoforms retinaldehyde selectively sensitive short-wavelength light also present evidence show melanopsin functions bistable pigment system intrinsic photoisomerase regeneration function chromatically shifted longer wavelengths
