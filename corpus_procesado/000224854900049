adaptive divergence pigment composition promotes phytoplankton biodiversity 
dazzling diversity phytoplankton puzzled biologists decades- puzzle enlarged rather solved progressive discovery new phototrophic microorganisms oceans including picocyanobacteria pico-eukaryotes bacteriochlorophyll-based- rhodopsin-based phototrophic bacteria physiological genomic studies suggest natural selection promotes niche differentiation among phototrophic microorganisms particularly respect photosynthetic characteristics- analysed competition light two closely related picocyanobacteria synechococcus group isolated baltic sea one two red colour contains pigment phycoerythrin whereas blue-green contains high contents pigment phycocyanin report theory competition experiments reveal stable coexistence two picocyanobacteria owing partitioning light spectrum competition experiments third marine cyanobacterium capable adapting pigment composition show species persists investing pigment absorbs colour used competitors results demonstrate adaptive significance divergence pigment composition phototrophic microorganisms allows efficient utilization light energy favours species coexistence
