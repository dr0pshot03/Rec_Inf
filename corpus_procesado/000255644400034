subnanometer motion cargoes driven thermal gradients along carbon nanotubes
important issue nanoelectromechanical systems developing small electrically driven motors report artificial nanofabricated motor one short carbon nanotube moves relative another coaxial nanotube cargo attached ablated outer wall multiwalled carbon nanotube can rotate and/ translate along inner nanotube motion actuated imposing thermal gradient along nanotube allows subnanometer displacements opposed electromigration random walk effect
