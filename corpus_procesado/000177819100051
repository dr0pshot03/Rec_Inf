spatiotemporal pattern neural processing human auditory cortex 
principles auditory cortex uses decipher stream acoustic information remained elusive neural responses animal auditory cortex can broadly classified transient sustained activity examined existence similar principles human brain sound-evoked blood oxygen level-dependent signal response decomposed temporally independent transient sustained constituents predominated different portions-core belt-of auditory cortex converging unit recordings data suggest spatiotemporal pattern auditory cortex may represent fundamental principle analyzing sound information
