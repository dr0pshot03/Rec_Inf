stress signaling pathway adipose tissue regulates hepatic insulin resistance
high-fat diet causes activation regulatory protein c-jun nh-terminal kinase jnk1 triggers development insulin resistance jnk1 therefore potential target therapeutic treatment metabolic syndrome explored mechanism jnk1 signaling engineering mice jnk1 gene ablated selectively adipose tissue jnk1 deficiency adipose tissue suppressed high fat diet induced insulin resistance liver jnk1 dependent secretion inflammatory cytokine interleukin adipose tissue caused increased expression liver socs3 protein induces hepatic insulin resistance thus jnk1 activation adipose tissue can cause insulin resistance liver
