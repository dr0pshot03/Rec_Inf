sustained miniaturization anatomical innovation dinosaurian ancestors birds 
recent discoveries highlighted dramatic evolutionary transformation massive ground-dwelling theropod dinosaurs light volant birds apply bayesian approaches originally developed inferring geographic spread rates molecular evolution viruses different context: infer size changes rates anatomical innovation across skeletal characters fossils approaches identify two drivers underlying dinosaur-bird transition theropod lineage directly ancestral birds undergoes sustained miniaturization across million years least consecutive branches internodes evolves skeletal adaptations four times faster dinosaurs distinct prolonged phase miniaturization along bird stem facilitated evolution many novelties associated small body size reorientation body mass increased aerial ability paedomorphic skulls reduced snouts enlarged eyes brains
