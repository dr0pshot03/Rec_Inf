global analysis protein activities using proteome chips 
facilitate studies yeast proteome cloned open reading frames overexpressed purified corresponding proteins proteins printed onto slides high spatial density form yeast proteome microarray screened ability interact proteins phospholipids identified many new calmodulin phospholipid-interacting proteins; common potential binding motif identified many calmodulin-binding proteins thus microarrays entire eukaryotic proteome can prepared screened diverse biochemical activities microarrays can also used screen protein-drug interactions detect posttranslational modifications
