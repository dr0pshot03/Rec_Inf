ancestral chloroplast genome mesostigma viride reveals early branch green plant evolution
sequence comparisons suggest living green plants belong one two major phyla-: streptophyta land plants closest green algal relatives charophytes chlorophyta rest green algae green algae known pre-date streptophyta/chlorophyta split also earliest diverging green algae show considerable morphological variation nature unicellular flagellate ancestor two green plant phyla unknown report flagellate mesostigma viride belongs earliest diverging green plant lineage discovered date sequenced entire chloroplast dna base pairs green alga conducted phylogenetic analyses sequences derived genome mesostigma represents lineage emerged divergence streptophyta chlorophyta position supported several features chloroplast dna structure gene organization genome indicate chloroplast dna architecture extremely well conserved line leading land plants
