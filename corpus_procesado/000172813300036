structural basis water-specific transport aqp1 water channel
water channels facilitate rapid transport water across cell membranes response osmotic gradients channels believed involved many physiological processes include renal water conservation neuro-homeostasis digestion regulation body temperature reproduction members water channel superfamily found range cell types bacteria human mammals currently families water channels referred aquaporins aqp: aqp0-aqp9 report structure aquaporin aqp1 water channel angstrom resolution channel consists three topological elements extracellular cytoplasmic vestibule connected extended narrow pore selectivity filter within selectivity filter four bound waters localized along three hydrophilic nodes punctuate otherwise extremely hydrophobic pore segment unusual combination long hydrophobic pore minimal number solute binding sites facilitates rapid water transport residues constriction region particular histidine conserved among known water-specific channels critical establishing water specificity analysis aqp1 pore also indicates transport protons channel highly energetically unfavourable
