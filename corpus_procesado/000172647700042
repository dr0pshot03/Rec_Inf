oscillating rows vortices superconductors
superconductors can used dissipation-free electrical conductors long vortices pinned vortices high-temperature superconductors however behave anomalously reflecting anisotropic layered structure can move readily thus preventing practical use specifically magnetic field tilted toward layer plane special vortex arrangement chain-lattice state formed real-time observation vortices using high-resolution lorentz microscopy revealed images chain vortices begin disappear much lower temperature t-d superconducting transition temperature t-c attribute image disappearance longitudinal oscillation vortices along chains
