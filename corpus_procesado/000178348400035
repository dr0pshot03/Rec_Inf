moving visual stimuli rapidly induce direction sensitivity developing tectal neurons 
development visual system pattern visual inputs may instructive role refining developing neural circuits1- visual inputs specific spatiotemporal patterns shape circuit development remains largely unknown report developing xenopus retinotectal system receptive field tectal neurons can trained become direction-sensitive within minutes repetitive exposure retina moving bars particular direction induction direction-sensitivity depends speed moving bar can induced random visual stimuli accompanied asymmetric modification tectal neurons receptive field furthermore training-induced changes require spiking tectal neuron activation nmda n-methyl-d-aspartate subtype glutamate receptors training attributable activity-induced enhancement glutamate-mediated inputs thus developing neural circuits can modified rapidly specifically visual inputs defined spatiotemporal patterns manner consistent predictions based spike-time-dependent synaptic modification
