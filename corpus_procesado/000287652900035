intrinsic transition embryonic stem-cell differentiation neural progenitors 
neural fate generally considered intrinsic direction embryonic stem es cell differentiation however little known intracellular mechanism leads undifferentiated cells adopt neural fate absence extrinsic inductive signals show zinc-finger nuclear protein zfp521 essential sufficient driving intrinsic neural differentiation mouse es cells absence neural differentiation inhibitor bmp4 strong zfp521 expression intrinsically induced differentiating es cells forced expression zfp521 enables neural conversion es cells even presence bmp4 conversely differentiation culture zfp521-depleted es cells undergo neural conversion tend halt epiblast state zfp521 directly activates early neural genes working co-activator p300 thus transition es cell differentiation epiblast state neuroectodermal progenitors specifically depends cell-intrinsic expression activator function zfp521
