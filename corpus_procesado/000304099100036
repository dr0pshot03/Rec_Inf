resolving time electron exits tunnelling barrier
tunnelling particle barrier one fundamental ubiquitous quantum processes induced intense laser field electron tunnelling atoms molecules initiates broad range phenomena generation attosecond pulses laser-induced electron diffraction holography processes evolve attosecond timescale attosecond equivalent - seconds well suited investigation general issue much debated since early days quantum mechanics--the link tunnelling electron barrier dynamics outside barrier previous experiments measured tunnelling rates attosecond time resolution tunnelling delay times study laser-induced tunnelling using weak probe field steer tunnelled electron lateral direction monitor effect attosecond light bursts emitted liberated electron re-encounters parent ion show approach allows us measure time electron exits tunnelling barrier demonstrate high sensitivity measurement detecting subtle delays ionization times two orbitals carbon dioxide molecule measurement tunnelling process essential attosecond experiments strong-field ionization initiates ultrafast dynamics approach provides general tool time-resolving multi-electron rearrangements atoms molecules--one key challenges ultrafast science
