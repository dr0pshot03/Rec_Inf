tracing black hole mergers radio lobe morphology 
binary supermassive black holes produced galactic mergers black holes two galaxies fall center merged system form bound pair two black holes will eventually coalesce enormous burst gravitational radiation show orientation black holes spin axis change dramatically even minor merger leading sudden flip direction associated jet identify winged x-type radio sources galaxies occurred inferred coalescence rate similar overall galaxy merger rate implying order one merger event per year detected gravitational wave interferometers
