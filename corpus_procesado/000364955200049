transcription factor trapping rna gene regulatory elements 
transcription factors tfs bind specific sequences promoter-proximal distal dna elements regulate gene transcription rna transcribed dna elements dna binding tfs bind rna hence rna transcribed regulatory elements may contribute stable tf occupancy sites show ubiquitously expressed tf yin-yang yy1 binds gene regulatory elements associated rna species across entire genome reduced transcription regulatory elements diminishes yy1 occupancy whereas artificial tethering rna enhances yy1 occupancy elements propose rna makes modest important contribution maintenance certain tfs gene regulatory elements suggest transcription regulatory elements produces positive-feedback loop contributes stability gene expression programs
