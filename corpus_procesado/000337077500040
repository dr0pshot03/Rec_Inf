human genetics genetics mexico recapitulates native american substructure affects biomedical traits
mexico harbors great cultural ethnic diversity yet fine-scale patterns human genome-wide variation region remain largely uncharacterized studied genomic variation within mexico individuals representing indigenous mestizo populations found striking genetic stratification among indigenous populations within mexico varying degrees geographic isolation groups differentiated europeans east asians pre-columbian genetic substructure recapitulated indigenous ancestry admixed mestizo individuals across country furthermore two independently phenotyped cohorts mexicans mexican americans showed significant association subcontinental ancestry lung function thus accounting fine-scale ancestry patterns critical medical population genetic studies within mexico mexican-descent populations likely many populations worldwide
