three-dimensional imaging dislocations nanoparticle atomic resolution
dislocations interactions strongly influence many material properties ranging strength metals alloys efficiency light-emitting diodes laser diodes- several experimental methods can used visualize dislocations transmission electron microscopy tem long used image dislocations materials- high-resolution electron microscopy can reveal dislocation core structures high detail particularly annular dark-field mode tem image however represents two-dimensional projection three-dimensional 3d object although stereo tem provides limited information 3d dislocations x-ray topography can image dislocations three dimensions reduced resolution using weak-beam dark-field tem13 scanning tem14 electron tomography used image 3d dislocations resolution five nanometres refs atom probe tomography can offer higher-resolution 3d characterization dislocations requires needle-shaped samples can detect per cent atoms sample report 3d imaging dislocations materials atomic resolution electron tomography applying 3d fourier filtering together equal-slope tomographic reconstruction observe nearly atoms multiply twinned platinum nanoparticle observed atomic steps 3d twin boundaries imaged 3d core structure edge screw dislocations atomic resolution dislocations atomic steps twin boundaries appear stress-relief mechanisms visible conventional two-dimensional projections ability image 3d disordered structures dislocations atomic resolution expected find applications materials science nanoscience solid-state physics chemistry
