detection earth-like planets around nearby stars using petal-shaped occulter 
direct observation earth-like planets extremely challenging parent stars times brighter lie just fraction arcsecond away space twinkle atmosphere smear light gone problems light scatter diffraction telescopes remain two proposed solutions-a coronagraph internal telescope nulling interferometry formation-flying telescopes-both require exceedingly clean wavefront control optics attractive variation coronagraph place occulting shield outside telescope blocking starlight even enters optical path diffraction scatter around occulter however limited effective suppression practically sized missions- report occulter design achieve required suppression can built existing technology compact mission architecture coronagraph traded inconvenience two spacecraft daunting optics challenges replaced simple deployable sheet m diameter occulter flown formation telescope least one metre aperture terrestrial planets seen studied around stars distance ten parsecs
