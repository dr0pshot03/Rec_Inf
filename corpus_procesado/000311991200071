sexually dimorphic bdnf signaling directs sensory innervation mammary gland
neural circuits associated sexually dimorphic organs differentially assembled development unclear report sexually dimorphic pattern mouse mammary gland sensory innervation mechanism formation brain-derived neurotrophic factor bdnf emanating mammary mesenchyme signaling receptor trkb sensory axons required establishing mammary gland sensory innervation sexes early developmental stages subsequently males androgens promote mammary mesenchymal expression truncated form trkb prevents bdnf-trkb signaling sensory axons leads rapid loss mammary gland innervation independent neuronal apoptosis thus sex hormone regulation neurotrophic factor signal directs sexually dimorphic axonal growth maintenance resulting generation sex-specific neural circuit
