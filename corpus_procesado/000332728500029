ligand-controlled csp-h arylation olefination synthesis unnatural chiral alpha-amino acids 
use ligands tune reactivity selectivity transition metal catalysts csp-h bond functionalization central challenge synthetic organic chemistry herein report rare example catalyst-controlled csp-h arylation using pyridine quinoline derivatives: former promotes exclusive monoarylation whereas latter activates catalyst achieve diarylation successive application ligands enables sequential diarylation methyl group alanine derivative two different aryl iodides affording wide range beta-ar-beta-ar-alpha-amino acids excellent levels diastereoselectivity diastereomeric ratio > : configurations beta-chiral center can accessed choosing order aryl groups installed use quinoline derivative ligand also enables csp-h olefination protected alanine
