generation fock states superconducting quantum circuit 
spin systems harmonic oscillators comprise two archetypes quantum mechanics1 spin-/ system two quantum energy levels essentially nonlinear system found nature whereas harmonic oscillator represents linear infinite number evenly spaced quantum levels significant difference systems two level spin can prepared arbitrary quantum state using classical excitations whereas classical excitations applied oscillator generate coherent state nearly indistinguishable classical state2 quantum behaviour oscillator obvious fock states states specific numbers energy quanta states hard create3- demonstrate controlled generation multi photon fock states solid state system use superconducting phase qubit8 close approximation two level spin system coupled microwave resonator acts harmonic oscillator prepare analyse pure fock states six photons contrast fock states coherent states generated using classical pulses applied directly resonator
