mode-specific energy disposal four-atom reaction oh+d > hod+d 
experiments employing crossed molecular beams vibrational state resolution performed simplest four-atom reaction oh + d -> hod + d good agreement recent quantum scattering predictions mode-specific reaction dynamics observed vibration newly formed oxygen-deuterium bond preferentially excited v demonstrates quantum theoretical calculations past decade achieved remarkable accuracy three-atom reactions involving three dimensions progressed point now possible accurately predict energy disposal four-atom reactions involving six dimensions
