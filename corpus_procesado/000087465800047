neural synchrony correlates surface segregation rules
analyse image visual system must decompose scene relevant parts identifying distinct surfaces basic operation analysis believed precede object recognition two superimposed gratings moving different directions plaid stimuli may perceived either two surfaces one transparent sliding top component motion single pattern whose direction motion intermediate component vectors pattern motion- degree transparency hence perception can manipulated changing luminance grating intersections- show neurons two visual cortical areas-a18 pmls-synchronize discharges responding contours surface responding contours belonging different surfaces amplitudes responses correspond previously described rate predictions- component pattern motion contrast synchrony failed reflect transition component pattern motion induced manipulating degree transparency thus dynamic changes synchronization encode context-dependent way relations among simultaneous responses spatially superimposed contours thereby bias association distinct surfaces
