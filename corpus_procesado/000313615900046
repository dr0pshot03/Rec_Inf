nearly half exoplanets found within binary star systems reside wide binaries average stellar separations greater astronomical units one astronomical unit au earth-sun distance yet influence distant binary companions planetary evolution remains largely unstudied unlike tighter counterparts stellar orbits wide binaries continually change influence milky ways tidal field impulses passing stars report numerical simulations demonstrating variable nature wide binary star orbits dramatically reshapes planetary systems host typically billions years formation contrary previous understanding wide binary companions may often strongly perturb planetary systems triggering planetary ejections increasing orbital eccentricities surviving planets although hitherto recognized orbits giant exoplanets within wide binaries statistically eccentric around isolated stars eccentricity distributions well reproduced assume isolated stars wide binaries host similar planetary systems whose outermost giant planets scattered beyond au parent stars early internal instabilities consequently results suggest although wide binaries eventually remove distant planets many planetary systems isolated giant exoplanet systems harbour additional distant still undetected planets
