highly recurrent tert promoter mutations human melanoma
systematic sequencing human cancer genomes identified many recurrent mutations protein-coding regions genes rarely gene regulatory regions describe two independent mutations within core promoter telomerase reverse transcriptase tert gene coding catalytic subunit telomerase collectively occur % melanomas examined mutations generate de novo consensus binding motifs e-twenty-six ets transcription factors reporter assays mutations increased transcriptional activity tert promoter two-to fourfold examination cancer cell lines derived diverse tumor types revealed mutations cases % preliminary evidence elevated frequency bladder hepatocellular cancer cells thus somatic mutations regulatory regions genome may represent important tumorigenic mechanism
