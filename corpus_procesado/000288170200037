human-specific loss regulatory dna evolution human-specific traits
humans differ animals many aspects anatomy physiology behaviour however genotypic basis human-specific traits remains unknown recent whole-genome comparisons made possible identify genes elevated rates amino acid change divergent expression humans non-coding sequences accelerated base pair changes- regulatory alterations may particularly likely produce phenotypic effects preserving viability known underlie interesting evolutionary differences species- identify molecular events particularly likely produce significant regulatory changes humans: complete deletion sequences otherwise highly conserved chimpanzees mammals confirm deletions humans fall almost exclusively non-coding regions enriched near genes involved steroid hormone signalling neural function one deletion removes sensory vibrissae penile spine enhancer human androgen receptor ar gene molecular change correlated anatomical loss androgen-dependent sensory vibrissae penile spines human lineage another deletion removes forebrain subventricular zone enhancer near tumour suppressor gene growth arrest dna-damage-inducible gamma gadd45g loss correlated expansion specific brain regions humans deletions tissue-specific enhancers may thus accompany loss gain traits human lineage provide specific examples kinds regulatory alterations- inactivation events long proposed important role human evolutionary divergence
