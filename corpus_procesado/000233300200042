formation stars gravitational collapse rather competitive accretion 
two dominant models stars form gravitational collapse star-forming molecular clumps typically hundreds thousands solar masses m fragment gaseous cores subsequently collapse make individual stars small multiple systems1- contrast competitive accretion theory suggests birth stars much smaller typical stellar mass similar 05m final stellar masses determined subsequent accretion unbound gas clump4- competitive accretion models interpret brown dwarfs free-floating planets protostars ejected star-forming clumps accreted much mass; key predictions model objects lack disks high velocity dispersions form frequently denser clumps9- mean stellar mass vary within galaxy8 derive rate competitive accretion function star-forming environment based partly simulation12 determine types environments competitive accretion can occur show observed star-forming region can undergo significant competitive accretion simulations show competitive accretion assumed properties differ determined observation result shows stars form gravitational collapse explains observations failed confirm predictions competitive accretion model
