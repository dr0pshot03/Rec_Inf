self-healing pulse-like shear ruptures laboratory
models predict dynamic shear ruptures earthquake faulting occur either sliding cracks large section interface slides behind fast-moving rupture front self-healing slip pulses fault relocks shortly behind rupture front report experimental visualizations crack-like pulse-like mixed rupture modes propagating along frictionally held incoherent interfaces separating identical solids describe conditions modes develop combination simultaneously performed measurements via dynamic photoelasticity laser interferometry reveals rupture mode type exact point rupture initiation sliding velocity history rupture propagation speed
