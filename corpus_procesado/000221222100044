female mating bias results conflicting sex-specific offspring fitness 
indirect-benefit models sexual selection assert females gain heritable offspring advantages mating bias males superior genetic quality generally tested associating simple morphological quality indicator example bird tail length offspring viability however selection acts simultaneously many characters limiting ability detect significant associations especially simple indicator weakly correlated male fitness furthermore recent conceptual developments suggest benefits gained mating biases may sex-specific sexually antagonistic genes differentially influence male female reproductive ability suitable test indirect-benefit model examine associations aggregate quality indicator male mating success gender-specific adult fitness components expectation components may trade show fathers mating success cricket allonemobius socius positively genetically correlated sons mating success negatively daughters reproductive success provides empirical evidence female mating bias can result sexually antagonistic offspring fitness
