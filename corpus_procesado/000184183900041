sustained division attentional spotlight 
voluntarily directing attention specific region visual scene can improve perception stimuli location ability focus attention upon specific zones visual field described metaphorically moveable spotlight zoom lens facilitates processing stimuli within beam long-standing controversy centred question whether spotlight spatial attention unitary beam whether can divided flexibly disparate locations- evidence supporting unitary spotlight view come numerous behavioural- electrophysiological studies recent experiments however indicate spotlight spatial attention may divided noncontiguous zones visual field brief stimulus exposures < ms use electrophysiological measure attentional allocation steady-state visual evoked potential show spotlight may divided spatially separated locations excluding interposed locations extended time periods spotlight division appears accomplished early stage visual-cortical processing
