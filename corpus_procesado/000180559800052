extended longevity mice lacking insulin receptor adipose tissue 
caloric restriction shown increase longevity organisms ranging yeast mammals organisms associated decreased fat mass alterations insulin/insulin-like growth factor igf- pathways explore associations enhanced longevity studied mice fat-specific insulin receptor knockout firko animals reduced fat mass protected age-related obesity subsequent metabolic abnormalities although food intake normal male female firko mice found increase mean life-span similar to134 days % parallel increases median maximum life-spans thus reduction fat mass without caloric restriction can associated increased longevity mice possibly effects insulin signaling
