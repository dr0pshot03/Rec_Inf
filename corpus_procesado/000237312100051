recognition histone h3 lysine methylation double tudor domain jmjd2a
biological responses histone methylation critically depend faithful readout transduction methyl-lysine signal effector proteins yet understanding methyl-lysine recognition far limited study histone binding chromodomain wd40-repeat proteins double tudor domain jmjd2a jmjc domain containing histone demethylase binds methylated histone h3-k4 h4-k20 found double tudor domain interdigitated structure unusual fold required ability bind methylated histone tails cocrystal structure jmjd2a double tudor domain trimethylated h3-k4 peptide reveals trimethyl-k4 bound cage three aromatic residues two tudor motif whereas binding specificity determined side-chain interactions involving amino acids tudor motif study provides mechanistic insights recognition methylated histone tails tudor domains reveals structural intricacy methyl-lysine recognition two closely spaced effector domains
