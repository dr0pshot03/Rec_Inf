finite-frequency tomography reveals variety plumes mantle 
present tomographic evidence existence deep-mantle thermal convection plumes p-wave velocity images show least six well-resolved plumes extend lowermost mantle: ascension azores canary easter samoa tahiti less well-resolved plumes including hawaii may also reach lowermost mantle also see several plumes mostly confined upper mantle suggesting convection may partially separated two depth regimes observed plumes diameters several hundred kilometers indicating plumes convey substantial fraction internal heat escaping earth
