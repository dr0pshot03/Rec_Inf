conversion unc104/kif1a kinesin processive motor dimerization
unc104/kif1a belongs class monomeric kinesin motors thought possess unusual motility mechanism unlike unidirectional motion driven coordinated actions two heads conventional kinesins single-headed kif1a reported undergo biased diffusional motion along microtubules show unc104/kif1a can dimerize move unidirectionally processively rapid velocities characteristic transport living cells results suggest unc104/kif1a operates vivo mechanism similar conventional kinesin regulation motor dimerization may used control transport class kinesins
