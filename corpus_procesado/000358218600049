keeping cool: enhanced optical reflection radiative heat dissipation saharan silver ants
saharan silver ants cataglyphis bombycina forage extreme temperature conditions african desert show ants conspicuous silvery appearance created dense array triangular hairs two thermoregulatory effects enhance reflectivity ants body surface visible near-infrared range spectrum solar radiation culminates also emissivity ant mid-infrared latter effect enables animals efficiently dissipate heat back surroundings via blackbody radiation full daylight conditions biological solution thermoregulatory problem may lead development biomimetic coatings passive radiative cooling objects
