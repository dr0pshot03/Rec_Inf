photoentrainment pupillary light reflex mediated distinct populations iprgcs 
intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells iprgcs express photopigment melanopsin regulate wide array light-dependent physiological processes- genetic ablation iprgcs eliminates circadian photoentrainment severely disrupts pupillary light reflex plr show iprgcs consist distinct subpopulations differentially express brn3b transcription factor can functionally distinguished brn3b-negative m1 iprgcs innervate suprachiasmatic nucleus scn hypothalamus whereas brn3b-positive iprgcs innervate known brain targets including olivary pre-tectal nucleus consistent innervation patterns selective ablation brn3b-positive iprgcs severely disrupts plr impair circadian photoentrainment thus find molecularly distinct subpopulations m1 iprgcs morphologically electrophysiologically similar innervate different brain regions execute specific light-induced functions
