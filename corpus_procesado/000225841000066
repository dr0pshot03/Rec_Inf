nutrient availability regulates sirt1 forkhead-dependent pathway 
nutrient availability regulates life-span wide range organisms demonstrate mammalian cells acute nutrient withdrawal simultaneously augments expression sirt1 deacetylase activates forkhead transcription factor foxo3a knockdown foxo3a expression inhibited starvation-induced increase sirt1 expression stimulation sirt1 transcription foxo3a mediated two p53 binding sites present sirt1 promoter nutrient-sensitive physical interaction observed foxo3a p53 sirt1 expression induced starved p53-deficient mice thus mammalian cells p53 foxo3a sirt1 three proteins separately implicated aging constitute nutrient-sensing pathway
