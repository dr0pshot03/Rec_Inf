single-cell transcriptomics reveals bimodality expression splicing immune cells 
recent molecular studies shown even derived seemingly homogenous population individual cells can exhibit substantial differences gene expression protein levels phenotypic output- important functional consequences existing studies cellular heterogeneity however typically measured pre-selected rnas1 proteins simultaneously genomic profiling methods applied single cells recently- use single-cell rna sequencing investigate heterogeneity response mouse bone-marrow-derived dendritic cells bmdcs lipopolysaccharide find extensive previously unobserved bimodal variation messenger rna abundance splicing patterns validate rna-fluorescence situ hybridization select transcripts particular hundreds key immune genes bimodally expressed across cells surprisingly even genes highly expressed population average moreover splicing patterns demonstrate previously unobserved levels heterogeneity cells observed bimodality can attributed closely related yet distinct known maturity states bmdcs portions reflect differences usage key regulatory circuits example identify module highly variable yet co-regulated antiviral response genes using cells knockout mice show variability module may propagated interferon feedback circuit involving transcriptional regulators stat2 irf7 study demonstrates power promise single-cell genomics uncovering functional diversity cells deciphering cell states circuits
