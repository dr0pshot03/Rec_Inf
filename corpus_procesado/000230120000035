sound velocities hot dense iron: birchs law revisited 
sound velocities hexagonal close-packed iron hcp-fe measured pressures gigapascals temperatures kelvin nuclear inelastic x-ray scattering laser-heated diamond anvil cell compressional-wave velocities v-p shear-wave velocities v-s hcp-fe decreased significantly increasing temperature moderately high pressures v-p v-s high pressures temperatures thus fitted linear relation birchs law used extrapolate measured sound velocities densities iron earths interior result means light elements earths core inferred linear extrapolation room temperature
