ecosystem response elevated co2 levels limited nitrogen-induced plant species shift
terrestrial ecosystems gain carbon photosynthesis lose mostly form carbon dioxide co2 extent biosphere can act buffer rising atmospheric co2 concentration global climate change projections remains uncertain present stage- biogeochemical theory predicts soil nitrogen n scarcity may limit natural ecosystem response elevated co2 concentration diminishing co2-fertilization effect terrestrial plant productivity unmanaged ecosystems- recent models incorporated carbon-nitrogen interactions suggest anthropogenic n sources help sustain future co2-fertilization effect however conclusive demonstration added n enhances plant productivity response co2-fertilization natural ecosystems remains elusive manipulated atmospheric co2 concentration soil n availability herbaceous brackish wetland plant community composition dominated c sedge c grasses capable responding rapidly environmental change found n addition enhanced co2-stimulation plant productivity first year multi-year experiment indicating n-limitation co2 response also found n addition strongly promotes encroachment c plant species respond less strongly elevated co2 concentrations overall found observed shift plant community composition ultimately suppresses co2-stimulation plant productivity third fourth years although extensive research shown global change factors elevated co2 concentrations n pollution affect plant species differently- may drive plant community changes- demonstrate plant community shifts can act feedback effect alters whole ecosystem response elevated co2 concentrations moreover suggest trade-offs abilities plant taxa respond positively different perturbations may constrain natural ecosystem response global change
