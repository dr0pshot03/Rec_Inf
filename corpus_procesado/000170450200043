spanwise flow attachment leading-edge vortex insect wings
flow structure largely responsible good performance insect wings recently identified leading-edge vortex vortices become detached wing two-dimensional flow unknown mechanism must keep attached three-dimensional flapping wings current explanation analogous mechanism operating delta-wing aircraft spanwise flow spiral vortex drains energy vortex core tested hypothesis systematically mapping flow generated dynamically scaled model insect simultaneously measuring resulting aerodynamic forces report reynolds numbers matching flows relevant insects flapping wings generate spiral vortex akin produced delta-wing aircraft also rnd limiting spanwise flow fences edge baffles cause detachment leading-edge vortex data support alternative hypothesis-that downward flow induced tip vortices limits growth leading-edge vortex
