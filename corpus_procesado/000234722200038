ion distributions near liquid-liquid interface 
mean field theories ion distributions gouy-chapman theory describes distribution near charged planar surface ignore molecular-scale structure liquid solution predictions gouy-chapman theory vary substantially x-ray reflectivity measurements interface two electrolyte solutions molecular dynamics simulations include liquid structure used calculate potential mean force single ion used potential mean force generalized poisson-boltzmann equation predict full ion distributions distributions agree measurements without adjustable parameters
