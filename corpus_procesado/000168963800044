protective role ob atp-sensitive potassium channels hypoxia-induced generalized seizure 
adenosine triphosphate atp-sensitive potassium k-atp channels activated various metabolic stresses including hypoxia substantia nigra pars reticulata snr area highest expression k-atp channels brain plays pivotal role control seizures mutant mice lacking kir62 subunit k-atp channels [knockout ko mice] susceptible generalized seizures brief hypoxia normal mice snr neuron activity inactivated hypoxia opening postsynaptic k-atp channels whereas ko mice activity neurons enhanced k-atp channels exert depressant effect snr neuronal activity hypoxia may involved nigral protection mechanism generalized seizures
