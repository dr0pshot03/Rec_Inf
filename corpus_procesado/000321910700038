high-molecular-mass hyaluronan mediates cancer resistance naked mole rat 
naked mole rat heterocephalus glaber displays exceptional longevity maximum lifespan exceeding years1- longest reported lifespan rodent species especially striking considering small body mass naked mole rat comparison similarly sized house mouse maximum lifespan years45 addition longevity naked mole rats show unusual resistance cancer multi-year observations large naked mole-rat colonies detect single incidence cancer26 identify mechanism responsible naked mole rats cancer resistance found naked mole-rat fibroblasts secrete extremely high-molecular-mass hyaluronan ha five times larger human mouse ha high-molecular-mass ha accumulates abundantly naked mole-rat tissues owing decreased activity ha-degrading enzymes unique sequence hyaluronan synthase has2 furthermore naked mole-rat cells sensitive ha signalling higher affinity ha compared mouse human cells perturbation signalling pathways sufficient malignant transformation mouse fibroblasts fails transform naked mole-rat cells however high molecular-mass ha removed either knocking has2 overexpressing ha-degrading enzyme hyal2 naked mole-rat cells become susceptible malignant transformation readily form tumours mice speculate naked mole rats evolved higher concentration ha skin provide skin elasticity needed life underground tunnels trait may co-opted provide cancer resistance longevity species
