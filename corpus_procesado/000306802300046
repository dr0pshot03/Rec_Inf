human alpha-defensin promotes mucosal innate immunity self-assembled peptide nanonets
defensins antimicrobial peptides contribute broadly innate immunity including protection mucosal tissues human alpha-defensin hd highly expressed secretory paneth cells small intestine however contrast defensins lacks appreciable bactericidal activity nevertheless report hd6 affords protection invasion enteric bacterial pathogens vitro vivo stochastic binding bacterial surface proteins hd6 undergoes ordered self-assembly form fibrils nanonets surround entangle bacteria self-assembly mechanism occurs vivo requires histidine- consistent x-ray crystallography data findings support key role hd6 protecting small intestine invasion diverse enteric pathogens may explain conservation hd6 throughout hominidae evolution
