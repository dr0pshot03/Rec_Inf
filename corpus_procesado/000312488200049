evaporative cooling dipolar hydroxyl radical 
atomic physics revolutionized development forced evaporative cooling led directly observation bose-einstein condensation quantum-degenerate fermi gases ultracold optical lattice simulations condensed-matter phenomena recently substantial progress made production cold molecular gases permanent electric dipole moment expected generate systems varied controllable phases- dynamics- chemistry- however although advances made direct cooling cold-association techniques evaporative cooling achieved far due unfavourable ratios elastic inelastic scattering impractically slow thermalization rates available trapped species report observation microwave-forced evaporative cooling neutral hydroxyl oh center dot molecules loaded stark-decelerated beam extremely high-gradient magnetic quadrupole trap demonstrate cooling least one order magnitude temperature corresponding increase phase-space density three orders magnitude limited low-temperature sensitivity spectroscopic thermometry technique evaporative cooling sufficiently large initial population much colder temperatures possible even quantum-degenerate gas dipolar radical anything else can sympathetically cool may within reach
