niche engineering demonstrates latent capacity fungal-algal mutualism
mutualistic symbioses shape evolution species ecosystems catalyze emergence biological complexity yet symbioses first form unclear show obligate mutualism yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae alga chlamydomonas reinhardtii-two model eukaryotes different life histories-can arise spontaneously environment requiring reciprocal carbon nitrogen exchange capacity mutualism phylogenetically broad extending chlamydomonas fungal species furthermore witnessed spontaneous association chlamydomonas algal cells physically interacting filamentous fungi observations demonstrate specific conditions environmental change induces free-living species become obligate mutualists establishes set experimentally tractable phylogenetically related synthetic systems studying evolution symbiosis
