niemann-pick c1 like protein critical intestinal cholesterol absorption
dietary cholesterol consumption intestinal cholesterol absorption contribute plasma cholesterol levels risk factor coronary heart disease molecular mechanism sterol uptake lumen small intestine poorly defined show niemann-pick c1 like npc1l1 protein plays critical role absorption intestinal cholesterol npc1l1 expression enriched small intestine brush border membrane enterocytes although otherwise phenotypically normal npc1l1-deficient mice exhibit substantial reduction absorbed cholesterol unaffected dietary supplementation bile acids ezetimibe drug inhibits cholesterol absorption effect npc1l1 knockout mice suggesting npc1l1 resides ezetimibe-sensitive pathway responsible intestinal cholesterol absorption
