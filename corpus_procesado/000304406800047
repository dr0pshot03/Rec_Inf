metabolite profiling identifies key role glycine rapid cancer cell proliferation 
metabolic reprogramming proposed hallmark cancer yet systematic characterization metabolic pathways active transformed cells currently lacking using mass spectrometry measured consumption release core profiles metabolites media across nci cancer cell lines integrated data preexisting atlas gene expression analysis identified glycine consumption expression mitochondrial glycine biosynthetic pathway strongly correlated rates proliferation across cancer cells antagonizing glycine uptake mitochondrial biosynthesis preferentially impaired rapidly proliferating cells moreover higher expression pathway associated greater mortality breast cancer patients increased reliance glycine may represent metabolic vulnerability selectively targeting rapid cancer cell proliferation
