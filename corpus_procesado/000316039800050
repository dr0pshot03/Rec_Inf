non-optimal codon usage affects expression structure function clock protein frq 
codon-usage bias observed almost genomes thought result selection efficient accurate translation highly expressed genes1- codon usage also implicated control transcription splicing rna structure4- many genes exhibit little codon-usage bias thought reflect lack selection messenger rna translation alternatively however non-optimal codon usage may biological importance rhythmic expression proper function neurospora frequency frq protein essential circadian clock function show unlike genes neurospora frq exhibits non-optimal codon usage across entire open reading frame optimization frq codon usage abolishes overt molecular circadian rhythms codon optimization increases frq levels unexpectedly also results conformational changes frq protein altered frq phosphorylation profile stability impaired functions circadian feedback loops results indicate non-optimal codon usage frq essential circadian clock function study provides example non-optimal codon usage functions regulate protein expression achieve optimal protein structure function
