slow earthquakes triggered typhoons
first reports slow earthquake event izu peninsula japan intraplate seismically active fault since many slow earthquakes detected- suggested slow events may trigger ordinary earthquakes context supported numerical modelling broader significance terms earthquake occurrence remains unclear triggering earthquakes received much attention: strain diffusion large regional earthquakes shown influence large earthquake activity earthquakes may triggered passage teleseismic waves phenomenon now recognized common- show eastern taiwan slow earthquakes can triggered typhoons model largest earthquakes repeated episodes slow slip reverse fault just land dipping west characteristics events sufficiently similar can modelled minor variations model parameters lower pressure results small unclamping fault must close failure condition typhoon act trigger area experiences high compressional deformation paucity large earthquakes repeating slow events may segmenting stressed area thus inhibiting large earthquakes require long continuous seismic rupture
