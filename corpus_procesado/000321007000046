b cells use mechanical energy discriminate antigen affinities 
generation high-affinity antibodies depends ability b cells extract antigens surfaces antigen-presenting cells b cells express high-affinity b cell receptors bcrs acquire antigen obtain better t cell help however mechanisms b cells extract antigen remain unclear using fluid flexible membrane substrates mimic antigen-presenting cells showed b cells acquire antigen dynamic myosin iia-mediated contractions pull invaginate presenting membranes forces generated myosin iia contractions ruptured individual bcr-antigen bonds promoted internalization high-affinity multivalent bcr microclusters thus b cell contractility contributes affinity discrimination mechanically testing strength antigen binding
