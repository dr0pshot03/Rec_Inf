direct control germline stem cell division cyst growth neural insulin drosophila
stem cells reside specialized niches provide signals required maintenance division tissue-extrinsic signals can also modify stem cell activity although poorly understood report neural-derived drosophila insulin-like peptides dilps directly regulate germline stem cell division rate demonstrating signals mediating ovarian response nutritional input can modify stem cell activity niche-independent manner also reveal crucial direct role dilps controlling germline cyst growth vitellogenesis
