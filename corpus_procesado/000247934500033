genome-wide transgenic rnai library conditional gene inactivation drosophila 
forward genetic screens model organisms provided important insights numerous aspects development physiology pathology availability complete genome sequences introduction rna-mediated gene interference rnai systematic reverse genetic screens now also possible now genome-wide rnai screens mostly restricted cultured cells ubiquitous gene inactivation caenorhabditis elegans powerful approach yet applied tissue-specific manner report generation validation genome-wide library drosophila melanogaster rnai transgenes enabling conditional inactivation gene function specific tissues intact organism rnai transgenes consist short gene fragments cloned inverted repeats expressed using binary gal4/uas system generated transgenic lines covering % predicted protein-coding genes drosophila genome molecular phenotypic assays indicate majority transgenes functional transgenic rnai library thus opens prospect systematically analysing gene functions tissue stage drosophila lifespan
