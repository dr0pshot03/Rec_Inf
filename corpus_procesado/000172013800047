preservation species abundance marine death assemblages 
fossil assemblages skeletal material thought differ source live communities particularly relative abundance species owing potential bias postmortem transport time-averaging multiple generations however statistical meta-analysis marine molluscan data sets indicates although sensitive sieve mesh-size environment time-averaged death assemblages retain strong signal species original rank orders naturally accumulated death assemblages thus provide reliable means acquiring abundance data key new generation paleobiologic macroecologic questions extending ecological time-series via sedimentary cores
