genetic diversity honey bee colonies enhances productivity fitness 
honey bee queens mate many males creating numerous patrilines within colonies genetically distinct effects genetic diversity colony productivity long-term fitness unknown show swarms genetically diverse colonies patrilines per colony founded new colonies faster swarms genetically uniform colonies patriline per colony accumulated differences foraging rates food storage population growth led impressive boosts fitness ie drone production winter survival genetically diverse colonies results understanding origins polyandry honey bees benefits colony performance
