iron-based catalysts improved oxygen reduction activity polymer electrolyte fuel cells
iron-based catalysts oxygen-reduction reaction polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells poorly competitive platinum catalysts part comparatively low number active sites per unit volume produced microporous carbon-supported iron-based catalysts active sites believed contain iron cations coordinated pyridinic nitrogen functionalities interstices graphitic sheets within micropores found greatest increase site density obtained mixture carbon support phenanthroline ferrous acetate ball-milled pyrolyzed twice first argon ammonia current density cathode made best iron-based electrocatalyst reported can equal platinum-based cathode loading milligram platinum per square centimeter cell voltage > volt
