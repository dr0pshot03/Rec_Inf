nmda receptor-dependent synaptic reinforcement crucial process memory consolidation 
hippocampal ca1 region crucial converting new memories long-term memories process believed continue weeks initial learning developing inducible reversible ca1-specific knockout technique switch n-methyl-d-aspartate nmda receptor function ca1 consolidation period data indicate memory consolidation depends reactivation nmda receptor possibly reinforce site-specific synaptic modifications consolidate memory traces synaptic reinforcement process may also serve cellular means new memory transferred hippocampus cortex permanent storage
