carbonatite melts electrical conductivity asthenosphere 
electrically conductive regions earths mantle interpreted reflect presence either silicate melt water dissolved olivine basis laboratory measurements show molten carbonates electrical conductivities three orders magnitude higher molten silicate five orders magnitude higher hydrated olivine high conductivities asthenosphere probably indicate presence small amounts carbonate melt peridotite can therefore interpreted terms carbon concentration upper mantle show conductivity oceanic asthenosphere can explained volume percent carbonatite melts average agrees carbon dioxide content mid-ocean ridge basalts
