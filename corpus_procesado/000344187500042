luminal signalling links cell communication tissue architecture organogenesis 
morphogenesis process whereby cell collectives shaped differentiated tissues organs self-organizing nature morphogenesis recently demonstrated studies showing stem cells three-dimensional culture can generate complex organoids mini-guts optic-cups even mini-brains achieve cell collectives must regulate activity secreted signalling molecules control cell differentiation presumably self-assembly microenvironments niches however mechanisms allow changes tissue architecture feedback directly activity extracellular signals described investigate process tissue assembly controls signalling activity organogenesis vivo using migrating zebrafish lateral line primordium show fibroblast growth factor fgf activity within tissue controls frequency deposits rosette-like mechanosensory organs live imaging reveals fgf becomes specifically concentrated microluminal structures assemble centre organs spatially constrain signalling activity genetic inhibition microlumen assembly laser micropuncture experiments demonstrate microlumina increase signalling responses participating cells thus allowing fgf coordinate migratory behaviour cell groups tissue rear formation central lumen self-organizing property many cell types epithelia embryonic stem cells luminal signalling provides potentially general mechanism locally restrict coordinate enhance cell communication within tissues
