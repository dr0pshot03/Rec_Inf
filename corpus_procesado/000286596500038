structural basis site-specific ribose methylation box c/d rna protein complexes 
box c/d rna protein complexes rnps direct site-specific -o-methylation rna ribosome assembly- guide rna c/d rnp forms base pairs complementary substrates selects modification site using molecular ruler- despite many studies c/d rnp structure- fundamental questions c/d rnas assemble rnps guide modification remain unresolved report crystal structure entire catalytically active archaeal c/d rnp consisting bipartite c/d rna associated two substrates two copies nop5 l7ae fibrillarin -angstrom resolution substrate pairs second eleventh nucleotide nucleotide guide resultant duplex bracketed channel flexible ends methyltransferase fibrillarin binds undistorted a-form structure guide-substrate duplex specifically loads target ribose active site interaction rna duplex alone determine site specificity fibrillarin positioned non-specific specific protein interactions compared structure inactive c/d rnp extensive domain movements induced substrate loading results reveal organization monomeric c/d rnp mechanism underlying site-specific methylation activity
