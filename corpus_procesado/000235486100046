parasitic plants one ubiquitous groups generalist parasites natural managed ecosystems known species worldwide- although much known parasitic plants influence host peformance- role drivers community ecosystem-level properties remains largely unexplored parasitic plants potential influence directly productivity structure plant communities cause harm particular host plants indirectly increasing competitive status non-host species- parasite-driven above-ground effects might also important indirect consequences altering quantity quality resources enter soil thereby affecting activity decomposer organisms- show model grassland communities parasitic plant rhinanthus minor occurs widely throughout europe north america strong direct effects above-ground community properties increasing plant diversity reducing productivity also show direct effects r minor plant community marked indirect effects below-ground properties ultimately increasing rates nitrogen cycling study provides evidence parasitic plants act major driver above-ground below-ground properties grassland ecosystems
