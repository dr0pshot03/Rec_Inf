favor survival food shortage brain disables costly memory
brain regulates energy homeostasis organism resource shortage brain takes priority peripheral organs energy supply can brain also down-regulate consumption favor survival show brain drosophila specifically disables costly formation aversive long-term memory ltm upon starvation physiological state required appetitive ltm formation neural circuit level slow oscillations normally triggered two pairs dopaminergic neurons enable aversive ltm formation abolished starved flies transient artificial activation neurons training restored ltm formation starved flies price reduced survival ltm formation thus subject adaptive plasticity helps survival food shortage
