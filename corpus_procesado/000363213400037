asteroseismology can reveal strong internal magnetic fields red giant stars
internal stellar magnetic fields inaccessible direct observations little known amplitude geometry evolution demonstrate strong magnetic fields cores red giant stars can identified asteroseismology fields can manifest via depressed dipole stellar oscillation modes arising magnetic greenhouse effect scatters traps oscillation-mode energy within core star kepler satellite observed dozen red giants depressed dipole modes interpret stars strongly magnetized cores find field strengths larger similar gauss may produce observed depression one case infer minimum core field strength approximate gauss
