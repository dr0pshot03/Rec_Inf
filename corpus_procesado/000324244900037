retardation arsenic transport pleistocene aquifer
groundwater drawn daily shallow alluvial sands millions wells large areas south southeast asia exposes estimated population hundred million people toxic levels arsenic holocene aquifers source widespread arsenic poisoning across region contrast pleistocene sands deposited region years ago mostly host groundwater high levels arsenic pleistocene aquifers increasingly used safe source drinking water therefore important understand conditions low levels arsenic can maintained reconstruct initial phase contamination pleistocene aquifer near hanoi vietnam demonstrate changes groundwater flow conditions redox state aquifer sands induced groundwater pumping caused lateral intrusion arsenic contamination metres holocene aquifer previously uncontaminated pleistocene aquifer also find arsenic adsorbs onto aquifer sands -fold retardation extent contamination relative reconstructed lateral movement groundwater period findings suggest arsenic contamination pleistocene aquifers south southeast asia consequence increasing levels groundwater pumping may delayed retardation arsenic transport
