two years meridiani planum: results opportunity rover 
mars exploration rover opportunity spent years exploring meridiani planum traveling similar kilometers detecting features reveal ancient environmental conditions include well-developed festoon trough cross-lamination formed flowing liquid water strata smaller abundant hematite-rich concretions seen previously possible relict hopper crystals might reflect formation halite thick weathering rinds rock surfaces resistant fracture fills networks polygonal fractures likely caused dehydration sulfate salts chemical variations depth show siliciclastic fraction outcrop rock undergone substantial chemical alteration precursor basaltic composition observations microscopic orbital scales indicate ancient meridiani abundant acidic groundwater arid oxidizing surface conditions occasional liquid flow surface
