direct visualization formation single-molecule conjugated copolymers 
electrochemical polymerization two different kinds thiophene monomers iodine-covered gold surface created highly assembled conjugated copolymers different electronic structures scanning tunneling microscope revealed images several linkage types: diblock triblock multiblock single strand conjugated copolymers exhibited anomalous swinging motion surface technique presents possibility understanding copolymerization process different monomers single-molecular scale building single-molecule superlattices surface controlled electropolymerization
