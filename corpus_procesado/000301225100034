nuclear fuel reactor accident
nuclear accidents lead melting reactor core create heterogeneous materials containing hundreds radionuclides many short half-lives long-lived fission products transuranium elements within damaged fuel remain concern millennia currently accurate fundamental models prediction release rates radionuclides fuel especially contact water accident remain limited relatively little known fuel corrosion radionuclide release extreme chemical radiation thermal conditions subsequent nuclear accident review current understanding nuclear fuel interactions environment including studies relatively narrow range geochemical hydrological radiation environments relevant geological repository performance discuss priorities research needed develop future predictive models
