fast vesicle fusion living cells requires least three snare complexes 
exocytosis requires formation snare [soluble n-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein snap receptor] complexes vesicle target membranes recent assessments reduced model systems produced divergent estimates number snare complexes needed fusion used titration approach answer question intact cultured chromaffin cells simultaneous expression wild-type snap- mutant unable support exocytosis progressively altered fusion kinetics fusion-pore opening indicating proteins assemble heteromeric fusion complexes expressing different wild-type: mutant ratios revealed third-power relation fast synchronous fusion near-linear relation overall release thus fast fusion typically observed synapses neurosecretory cells requires least three functional snare complexes whereas slower release might occur fewer complexes heterogeneity snare-complex number may explain heterogeneity vesicular release probability
