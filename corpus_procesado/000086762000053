recycled oceanic crust observed ghost plagioclase within source mauna loa lavas
hypothesis mantle plumes contain recycled oceanic crust now widely accepted specific source components hawaiian plume inferred represent recycled oceanic basalts pelagic sediments oceanic gabbros bulk lava compositions however retain specific trace-element fingerprint original crustal component highly attenuated form report discovery exotic strontium-enriched melt inclusions mauna loa olivines complete trace-element patterns strongly resemble layered gabbros found ophiolites characterized cumulus plagioclase high strontium abundances major-element compositions melts indicate composition result assimilation present-day oceanic crust melts travelled instead gabbro transformed high-pressure eclogite subduction recycling eclogite incorporated hawaiian mantle plume trace-element signature original plagioclase present ghost signature permits specific identification recycled rock type ghost plagioclase trace-element signature demonstrates former gabbro can retain much original chemical identity convective cycle without completely mixing portions former oceanic crust
