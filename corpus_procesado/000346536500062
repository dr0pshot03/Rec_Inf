direct observation closed magnetic flux trapped high-latitude magnetosphere 
structure earths magnetosphere poorly understood interplanetary magnetic field northward condition uncharacteristically energetic plasma observed magnetotail lobes expected textbook model magnetosphere using satellite observations show lobe plasma signatures occur high-latitude magnetic field lines closed fundamental plasma process magnetic reconnection previously suggested closed flux can become trapped lobe plasma-trapping process explain another poorly understood phenomenon: presence auroras extremely high latitudes called transpolar arcs observations aurora time lobe plasma signatures reveal presence transpolar arc excellent correspondence transpolar arc trapped closed flux high altitudes provides strong evidence trapping mechanism cause transpolar arcs
