electron paramagnetic resonance individual atoms surface 
combined high-energy resolution conventional spin resonance similar nano-electron volts scanning tunneling microscopy measure electron paramagnetic resonance individual iron fe atoms placed magnesium oxide film drove spin resonance oscillating electric field gigahertz tip sample readout fe atoms quantum state performed spin-polarized detection atomic-scale tunneling magnetoresistance determine energy relaxation time t approximate microseconds phase-coherence time t approximate nanoseconds spin resonance signals different fe atoms differ much resonance linewidth traditional ensemble measurement difference appear inhomogeneous broadening
