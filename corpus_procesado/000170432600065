crystal structure neutralizing human igg hiv-: template vaccine design
present crystal structure angstrom resolution human antibody lgg1 b12 antibody b12 recognizes cd4-binding site human immunodeficiency virus hiv- gp120 one two known antibodies gp120 capable broad potent neutralization primary hiv isolates key feature antibody-combining site protruding finger-like long cdr h3 can penetrate recessed cd4-binding site gp120 docking model b12 gp120 reveals severe structural constraints explain extraordinary challenge eliciting effective neutralizing antibodies similar b12 structure together mutagenesis studies provides rationale extensive cross-reactivity b12 valuable framework design hiv vaccines capable eliciting b12-like activity
