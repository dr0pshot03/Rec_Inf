direct ligand-receptor complex interaction controls brassica self-incompatibility
many higher plants evolved self-incompatibility mechanisms prevent self-fertilization brassica self-incompatibility recognition pollen stigma controlled s locus contains three highly polymorphic genes: s-receptor kinase srk s-locus protein sp11 also called s-locus cysteine-rich protein scr s-locus glycoprotein slg srk encodes membrane-spanning serine/threonine kinase determines s-haplotype specificity stigma sp11 encodes small cysteine-rich protein determines s-haplotype specificity pollen sp11 localized pollen coat thought self-pollination sp11 secreted pollen coat interacts cognate srk papilla cell stigma elicit self-incompatibility response slg secreted stigma protein highly homologous srk extracellular domain although required s-haplotype specificity stigma slg enhances self-incompatibility response however accomplished remains controversial- show single form sp11 s haplotype s--sp11 stabilized four intramolecular disulphide bonds specifically binds stigma membrane s haplotype induce autophosphorylation srk8 srk8 slg together form high-affinity receptor complex s--sp11 stigma membrane
