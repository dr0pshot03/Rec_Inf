direct ligand-receptor complex interaction controls brassica self-incompatibility 
many higher plants evolved self-incompatibility mechanisms prevent self-fertilization1 brassica self-incompatibility recognition pollen stigma controlled s locus contains three highly polymorphic genes: s-receptor kinase srk2 s-locus protein sp113 also called s-locus cysteine-rich protein; scr4 s-locus glycoprotein slg5 srk encodes membrane-spanning serine/threonine kinase determines s-haplotype specificity stigma6 sp11 encodes small cysteine-rich protein determines s-haplotype specificity pollen478 sp11 localized pollen coat8 thought self-pollination sp11 secreted pollen coat interacts cognate srk papilla cell stigma elicit self-incompatibility response slg secreted stigma protein9 highly homologous srk extracellular domain although required s-haplotype specificity stigma slg enhances self-incompatibility response6; however accomplished remains controversial10- show single form sp11 s- haplotype s--sp11 stabilized four intramolecular disulphide bonds specifically binds stigma membrane s- haplotype induce autophosphorylation srk8 srk8 slg8 together form high-affinity receptor complex s--sp11 stigma membrane
