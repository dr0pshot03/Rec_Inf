desulfurization transportation fuels zeolites ambient conditions
deep desulfurization transportation fuels gasoline diesel jet fuels mandated u s foreign governments also needed future fuel cell applications however extremely difficult costly achieve current technology requires catalytic reactors operated high pressure temperature show cu+ ag+ zeolite y can adsorb sulfur compounds commercial fuels selectively high sulfur capacities pi complexation ambient temperature pressure thus sulfur content reduced < parts per million weight commercial diesel sorbent capacity cubic centimeters clean diesel produced per gram sorbent sulfur selectivity capacity orders magnitude higher obtained previously known sorbents
