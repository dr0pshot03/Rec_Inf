constant elevation southern tibet past million years 
uplift tibetan plateau area km wide altitude m shown modify global climate- influence monsoon intensity- mechanical thermal models homogeneous thickening lithosphere make specific predictions uplift rates tibetan plateau precise history uplift plateau yet confirmed observations present well-preserved fossil leaf assemblages namling basin southern tibet dated similar to15 myr ago allow us reconstruct temperatures within basin time using numerical general circulation model estimate moist static energy location fossil leaves reconstruct elevation namling basin myr ago +/ m +/ m depending reference data used comparable present-day altitude m conclude elevation southern tibetan plateau probably remained unchanged past myr
