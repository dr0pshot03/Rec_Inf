surface hydrophobin prevents immune recognition airborne fungal spores
air breathe filled thousands fungal spores conidia per cubic metre certain composting environments can easily exceed per cubic metre originate hundred fungal species belonging mainly genera cladosporium penicillium alternaria aspergillus- although conidia contain many antigens allergens- known airborne fungal microflora activate host innate immune cells continuously induce detrimental inflammatory responses following inhalation show surface layer dormant conidia masks recognition immune system hence prevents immune response explore used several fungal members airborne microflora including human opportunistic fungal pathogen aspergillus fumigatus vitro assays dendritic cells alveolar macrophages vivo murine experiments fumigatus surface rodlet layer composed hydrophobic roda protein covalently bound conidial cell wall glycosylphosphatidylinositol-remnants roda extracted conidia fumigatus immunologically inert induce dendritic cell alveolar macrophage maturation activation failed activate helper t-cell immune responses vivo removal surface rodlet/hydrophobin layer either chemically using hydrofluoric acid genetically delta roda mutant biologically germination resulted conidial morphotypes inducing immune activation observations show hydrophobic rodlet layer conidial cell surface immunologically silences airborne moulds
