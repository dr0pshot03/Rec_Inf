silicate-mediated formose reaction: bottom-up synthesis sugar silicates 
understanding mechanism sugar formation stabilization important constraining theories abiotic origin complex biomolecules although previous studies produced sugars small molecules formose related reactions product mixtures complex unstable demonstrated simple two-and three-carbon molecules glycolaldehyde glyceraldehyde presence aqueous sodium silicate spontaneously form silicate complexes four-and six-carbon sugars respectively silicate selects sugars specific stereochemistry sequesters rapid decomposition given abundance silicate minerals observations suggest formose-like reactions may provide feasible pathway abiotic formation biologically important sugars ribose
