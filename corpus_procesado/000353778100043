direct observation hierarchical protein dynamics 
one fundamental challenges physical biology understand relationship protein dynamics function physiological temperatures functional motions arise complex interplay thermal motions proteins environments determine hierarchy protein conformational energy landscape underlies motions based series temperature-dependent magic-angle spinning multinuclear nuclear-magnetic-resonance relaxation measurements hydrated nanocrystalline protein results support strong coupling protein solvent dynamics kelvin fast solvent motions slow protein side-chain motions fast protein backbone motions activated consecutively low activation energy small-amplitude local motions dominate low temperatures larger-amplitude anisotropic functionally relevant motions involving entire peptide units becoming dominant temperatures kelvin
