genome host-cell transforming parasite theileria annulata compared t-parva 
theileria annulata t parva closely related protozoan parasites cause lymphoproliferative diseases cattle sequenced genome t annulata compared t parva understand mechanisms underlying transformation tropism despite high conservation gene sequences synteny analysis reveals unequally expanded gene families species-specific genes also identify divergent families putative secreted polypeptides may reduce immune recognition candidate regulators host-cell transformation theileria-specific protein domain [frequently associated theileria faint] present large number secreted proteins
