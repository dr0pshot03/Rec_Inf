structural basis amp binding mammalian amp-activated protein kinase
amp-activated protein kinase ampk regulates cellular metabolism response availability energy therefore target type ii diabetes treatment senses changes ratio amp/atp binding species competitive manner thus increases concentration amp activate ampk resulting phosphorylation differential regulation series downstream targets control anabolic catabolic pathways report crystal structure regulatory fragment mammalian ampk complexes amp atp phosphate groups amp/atp lie groove surface gamma domain lined basic residues many associated disease-causing mutations structural solution studies reveal two sites gamma domain bind either amp mg center dot atp whereas third site contains tightly bound amp exchange binding studies indicate physiological conditions ampk mainly exists inactive form complex mg center dot atp much abundant amp modelling studies suggest changes concentration amp [amp] enhance ampk activity levels structure also suggests mechanism propagating amp/atp signalling whereby phosphorylated residue alpha and/or beta subunits binds gamma subunit presence amp atp bound
