distinguishing inchworm hand-over-hand processive kinesin movement neck rotation measurements
motor enzyme kinesin makes hundreds unidirectional nanometer steps without detaching freely sliding along microtubule moves investigated kinesin stepping mechanism immobilizing drosophila kinesin derivative carboxyl-terminal end neck coiled-coil domain measuring orientations microtubules moved single enzyme molecules submicromolar adenosine triphosphate concentrations kinesin-mediated microtubule-surface linkage sufficiently torsionally stiff greater equal to2+/- x - newton meters per radian stepping hypothesized symmetric hand-over-hand mechanism produce 180degrees rotations microtubule relative immobilized kinesin neck fact rotations finding inconsistent symmetric hand-over-hand movement alternative inch-worm mechanism consistent experimental results
