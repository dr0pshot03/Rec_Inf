tfeb links autophagy lysosomal biogenesis
autophagy cellular catabolic process relies cooperation autophagosomes lysosomes starvation cell expands compartments enhance degradation processes found starvation activates transcriptional program controls major steps autophagic pathway including autophagosome formation autophagosome-lysosome fusion substrate degradation transcription factor eb tfeb master gene lysosomal biogenesis coordinated program driving expression autophagy lysosomal genes nuclear localization activity tfeb regulated serine phosphorylation mediated extracellular signal-regulated kinase whose activity tuned levels extracellular nutrients thus mitogen-activated protein kinase-dependent mechanism regulates autophagy controlling biogenesis partnership two distinct cellular organelles
