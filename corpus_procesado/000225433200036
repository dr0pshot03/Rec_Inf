synaptic laminin-calcium channel interaction organizes active zones motor nerve terminals
synapse formation requires differentiation functional nerve terminal opposite specialized postsynaptic membrane show laminin beta2 component synaptic cleft neuromuscular junction binds directly calcium channels required neurotransmitter release motor nerve terminals interaction leads clustering channels turn recruit presynaptic components perturbation interaction vivo results disassembly neurotransmitter release sites resembling defects previously observed autoimmune neuromuscular disorder lambert-eaton myasthenic syndrome results identify extracellular ligand voltage-gated calcium channel well new laminin receptor also suggest model development nerve terminals provide clues pathogenesis synaptic disease
