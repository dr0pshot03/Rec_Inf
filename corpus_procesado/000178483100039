superconductivity compressed lithium k 
superconductivity high temperatures expected elements low atomic numbers based part conventional bcs bardeen-cooper-schrieffer theory1 example predicted hydrogen compressed dense metallic phase pressures exceeding gpa will become superconducting transition temperature room temperature2 pressures difficult produce laboratory setting predictions easily confirmed normal conditions lithium lightest metal elements may become superconducting lower pressures34; tentative observation superconducting transition li previously reported5 show li becomes superconducting pressures greater gpa pressure-dependent transition temperature t-c k gpa highest observed tc element; confirms expectation elements low atomic numbers will high transition temperatures suggests metallic hydrogen will high t-c results confirm earlier tentative claim5 superconductivity li correct
