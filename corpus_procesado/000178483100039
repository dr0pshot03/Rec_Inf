superconductivity compressed lithium k 
superconductivity high temperatures expected elements low atomic numbers based part conventional bcs bardeen-cooper-schrieffer theory example predicted hydrogen compressed dense metallic phase pressures exceeding gpa will become superconducting transition temperature room temperature pressures difficult produce laboratory setting predictions easily confirmed normal conditions lithium lightest metal elements may become superconducting lower pressures tentative observation superconducting transition li previously reported show li becomes superconducting pressures greater gpa pressure-dependent transition temperature t-c k gpa highest observed tc element confirms expectation elements low atomic numbers will high transition temperatures suggests metallic hydrogen will high t-c results confirm earlier tentative claim superconductivity li correct
