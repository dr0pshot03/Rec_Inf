evidence common mechanism sirt1 regulation allosteric activators 
molecule treats multiple age-related diseases major impact global health economics sirt1 deacetylase drawn attention regard target drug design yet controversy exists around mechanism sirtuin-activating compounds stacs found specific hydrophobic motifs found sirt1 substrates pgc- alpha foxo3a facilitate sirt1 activation stacs single amino acid sirt1 glu230 located structured n-terminal domain critical activation previously reported stac scaffolds new class chemically distinct activators primary cells reconstituted activation-defective sirt1 metabolic effects stacs blocked thus sirt1 can directly activated allosteric mechanism common chemically diverse stacs
