protein kinase c overactivity impairs prefrontal cortical regulation working memory 
prefrontal cortex higher brain region regulates thought behavior emotion using representational knowledge operations often referred working memory tested influence protein kinase c pkc intracellular signaling prefrontal cortical cognitive function showed high levels pkc activity prefrontal cortex seen example stress exposure markedly impair behavioral electrophysiological measures working memory data suggest excessive pkc activation can disrupt prefrontal cortical regulation behavior thought possibly contributing signs prefrontal cortical dysfunction distractibility impaired judgment impulsivity thought disorder
