topologically protected quantum bits using josephson junction arrays 
physical implementations quantum bits qubits logical elements putative quantum computer must overcome conflicting requirements: qubits manipulable external signals remaining isolated environment proposals based quantum optics emphasize optimal isolation- following solid-state route exploit variability scalability nanoscale fabrication techniques- recently various designs using superconducting structures successfully tested quantum coherent operation- however ultimate goal reaching coherent evolution thousands elementary operations remains formidable task protecting qubits decoherence exploiting topological stability qualitatively new proposal holds promise long decoherence times physical implementation remained unclear show strongly correlated systems developing isolated twofold degenerate quantum dimer liquid ground state can used construction topologically stable qubits discuss implementation using josephson junction arrays although complexity architecture challenges technology base available today topological qubits greatly benefit built-in fault-tolerance
