genetic effects captive breeding cause rapid cumulative fitness decline wild 
captive breeding used supplement populations many species declining wild suitability long-term species survival programs remain largely untested however measured lifetime reproductive success first two generations steelhead trout reared captivity bred wild released reconstructing three-generation pedigree microsatellite markers show genetic effects domestication reduce subsequent reproductive capabilities similar % per captive-reared generation fish moved natural environments results suggest even generations domestication may negative effects natural reproduction wild repeated use captive-reared parents supplement wild populations carefully reconsidered
