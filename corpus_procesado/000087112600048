spin excitation spectrum superconducting ybacuo
comprehensive inelastic neutron scattering study magnetic excitations near optimally doped high-temperature superconductor ybacuo presented spin correlations normal state commensurate crystal lattice intensity peaked around wave vector characterizing antiferromagnetic state insulating precursor ybacuo profound modifications spin excitation spectrum appear abruptly superconducting transition temperature tc commensurate resonant mode set weaker incommensurate peaks develop data consistent models based underlying two-dimensional fermi surface predicting continuous downward dispersion relation connecting resonant mode incommensurate excitations magnetic incommensurability ybacuo+x system thus simply related another high-temperature superconductor la-xsrxcuo incommensurate peaks persist well tc temperature-dependent incommensurability difficult reconcile interpretations based charge stripe formation ybacuo+x near optimum doping
