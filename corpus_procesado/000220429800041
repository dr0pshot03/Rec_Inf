nanos maintains germline stem cell self-renewal preventing differentiation 
despite much progress understanding extrinsic signaling regulates stem cell self-renewal little known cell-autonomous gene regulation controls process drosophila ovaries germline stem cells gscs divide asymmetrically produce daughter gscs cystoblasts latter develop germline cysts show removing translational repressor nanos either gscs precursors primordial germ cells pgcs causes cell types differentiate germline cysts thus nanos essential establishing maintaining gscs preventing precocious entry oogenesis functions likely achieved repressing translation differentiation factors pgcs gscs
