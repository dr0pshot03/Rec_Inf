general integrative model scaling plant growth carbon flux functional trait spectra
linking functional traits plant growth critical scaling attributes organisms dynamics ecosystems understanding selection shapes integrated botanical phenotypes however general mechanistic theory showing traits specifically influence carbon biomass flux within across plants needed building foundational work relative growth rate- recent work functional trait spectra- metabolic scaling theory derive generalized trait-based model plant growth agreement wide variety empirical data model uniquely predicts key functional traits interact regulate variation relative growth rate allometric growth normalizations angiosperms gymnosperms quantitative form several functional trait spectra relationships model also provides general quantitative framework incorporate additional leaf-level trait scaling relationships hence unite functional trait spectra theories relative growth rate metabolic scaling apply model calculate carbon use efficiency often ignored trait may influence variation relative growth rate appears vary directionally across geographic gradients together results show quantitative plant traits geometry vascular transport networks can merged common scaling theory model provides framework predicting traits covary within integrated allometric phenotype also trait variation mechanistically influences plant growth carbon flux within across diverse ecosystems
