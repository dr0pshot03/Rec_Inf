de broglie wavelength non-local four-photon state
superposition one distinctive features quantum theory demonstrated numerous single-particle interference experiments- quantum entanglement coherent superposition states multi-particle systems yields complex phenomena one important type multi-particle experiment uses path-entangled number states exhibit pure higher-order interference potential applications metrology imaging include quantum interferometry spectroscopy phase sensitivity heisenberg limit- quantum lithography beyond classical diffraction limit generally understood optical implementations schemes lower-order interference effects always decrease overall performance higher particle numbers experiments therefore limited two photons- overcome limitation demonstrating four-photon interferometer based linear optics observe interference fringes periodicity one-quarter single-photon wavelength confirming presence four-particle mode-entangled state anticipate scheme extendable arbitrary photon numbers holding promise realizable applications entanglement-enhanced performance
