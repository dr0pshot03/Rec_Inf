integrin-linked kinase adaptor essential functions mouse development
development multicellular organisms requires integrin-mediated interactions cells extracellular environment integrin binding extracellular matrix catalyses assembly multiprotein complexes transduce mechanical chemical signals regulate many aspects cell physiology integrin-linked kinase ilk multifunctional protein binds beta-integrin cytoplasmic domains regulates actin dynamics recruiting actin binding regulatory proteins alpha-and beta-parvin ilk also shown possess serine/threonine kinase activity phosphorylate signalling proteins akt1 glycogen synthase kinase beta gsk3 beta mammalian cells however functions shown genetic studies occur flies worms show mice carrying point mutations proposed autophosphorylation site putative kinase domain pleckstrin homology domain normal contrast mice point mutations conserved lysine residue potential atp-binding site kinase domain mediates ilk binding alpha-parvin die owing renal agenesis similar renal defects occur alpha-parvin-null mice thus provide genetic evidence kinase activity ilk dispensable mammalian development however interaction ilk alpha-parvin critical kidney development
