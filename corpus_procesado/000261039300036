nanoscale chemical imaging working catalyst scanning transmission x-ray microscopy
modern chemical industryuses heterogeneous catalysts almost every production process commonly consist nanometre size active components typically metals metal oxides dispersed high surface area solid support performance depending catalysts nanometre size features interactions involving active components support reactant product molecules gain insight mechanisms heterogeneous catalysts guide design improved novel catalysts thus necessary detailed characterization physicochemical composition heterogeneous catalysts working state nanometre scale scanning probe microscopy methods used study inorganic catalyst phases subnanometre resolution- detailed chemical information materials working state often difficult obtain- contrast optical microspectroscopic approaches offer much flexibility situ chemical characterization however comes expense limited spatial resolution- recent development promising high spatial resolution chemical characterization capabilities scanning transmission x ray microscopy used proof principle study characterize solid catalyst show adapting nanoreactor specially designed high-resolution electron microscopy scanning transmission x ray microscopy can used atmospheric pressure degrees c monitor situ phase changes complex iron based fisher-tropsch catalyst nature location carbon species produced expect system capable operating degrees c will open new opportunities nanometre resolution imaging range important chemical processes taking place solids gaseous liquid environments
