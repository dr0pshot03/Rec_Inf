targeting diacylglycerol degradation m1 muscarinic receptors beta-arrestins 
seven-transmembrane receptor 7tmr signaling transduced second messengers diacylglycerol dag generated response heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding protein gq terminated receptor desensitization degradation second messengers show beta-arrestins coordinate processes gq-coupled m1 muscarinic receptor beta-arrestins physically interact diacylglycerol kinases dgks enzymes degrade dag moreover beta-arrestins essential conversion dag phosphatidic acid agonist stimulation activity requires recruitment beta-arrestin-dgk complex activated 7tmrs dual function beta-arrestins limiting production diacylglycerol receptor desensitization enhancing rate degradation analogous ability recruit adenosine -monophosphate phosphodiesterases gs-coupled beta2-adrenergic receptors thus beta-arrestins can serve similar regulatory functions disparate classes 7tmrs structurally dissimilar enzymes degrade chemically distinct second messengers
