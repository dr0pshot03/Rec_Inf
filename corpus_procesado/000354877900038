practical olefin hydroamination nitroarenes 
synthesis functionalization amines fundamentally important vast range chemical contexts present amine synthesis repurposes two simple feedstock building blocks: olefins nitro hetero arenes using readily available reactants operationally simple procedure protocol smoothly yields secondary amines formal olefin hydroamination presumed radical nature process hindered amines can easily accessed highly chemoselective transformation screen substrate combinations showcases tolerance numerous unprotected functional groups alcohols amines even boronic acids process orthogonal aryl amine syntheses buchwald-hartwig ullmann classical amine-carbonyl reductive aminations tolerates aryl halides carbonyl compounds
