enterotypes human gut microbiome 
knowledge species functional composition human gut microbiome rapidly increasing still based cohorts little known variation across world combining newly sequenced faecal metagenomes individuals four countries previously published data sets identify three robust clusters referred enterotypes hereafter nation continent specific also confirmed enterotypes two published larger cohorts indicating intestinal microbiota variation generally stratified continuous indicates existence limited number well-balanced host-microbial symbiotic states might respond differently diet drug intake enterotypes mostly driven species composition abundant molecular functions necessarily provided abundant species highlighting importance functional analysis understand microbial communities although individual host properties body mass index age gender explain observed enterotypes data-driven marker genes functional modules can identified host properties example twelve genes significantly correlate age three functional modules body mass index hinting diagnostic potential microbial markers
