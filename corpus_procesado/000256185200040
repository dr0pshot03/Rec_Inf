anatase tio2 single crystals large percentage reactive facets 
owing scientific technological importance inorganic single crystals highly reactive surfaces long studied1- unfortunately surfaces high reactivity usually diminish rapidly crystal growth process result minimization surface energy typical example titanium dioxide tio2 promising energy environmental applications14- available anatase tio2 crystals dominated thermodynamically stable {} facets per cent according wulff construction10 rather much reactive {} facets8-- demonstrate fluorine terminated surfaces relative stability reversed: {} energetically preferable {} explored effect systematically range non metallic adsorbate atoms first principle quantum chemical calculations basis theoretical predictions synthesized uniform anatase tio2 single crystals high percentage per cent {} facets using hydrofluoric acid morphology controlling agent moreover fluorated surface anatase single crystals can easily cleaned using heat treatment render fluorine-
