towards proteome-scale map human protein-protein interaction network 
systematic mapping protein-protein interactions interactome mapping initiated model organisms starting defined biological processes expanding scale proteome- although far complete maps revealed global topological dynamic features interactome networks relate known biological properties suggesting human interactome map will provide insight development disease mechanisms systems level describe initial version proteome-scale map human binary protein-protein interactions using stringent high-throughput yeast two-hybrid system tested pairwise interactions among products similar currently available gateway-cloned open reading frames detected similar interactions data set called ccsb-hi1 verification rate similar % revealed independent co-affinity purification assay correlates significantly biological attributes ccsb-hi1 data set increases similar % set available binary interactions within tested space reveals new connections disease-associated proteins work represents important step towards systematic comprehensive human interactome project
