interaction solar wind earths magnetosphere gives rise bright polar aurorae geomagnetic storms relation solar wind dynamics outer planets magnetospheres poorly understood jupiters magnetospheric dynamics aurorae dominated processes internal jovian system whereas saturns magnetosphere generally considered internal solar-wind-driven processes hypothesis however tentative limited simultaneous solar wind magnetospheric measurements report solar wind measurements immediately upstream saturn one-month period combined simultaneous ultraviolet imaging find unlike jupiter saturns aurorae respond strongly solar wind conditions contrast earth main controlling factor appears solar wind dynamic pressure electric field orientation interplanetary magnetic field playing much limited role saturns magnetosphere therefore strongly driven solar wind solar wind conditions drive differ drive earths magnetosphere
