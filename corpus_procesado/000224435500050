general mechanism perceptual decision-making human brain 
findings single-cell recording studies suggest comparison outputs different pools selectively tuned lower-level sensory neurons may general mechanism higher-level brain regions compute perceptual decisions example monkeys must decide whether noisy field dots moving upward downward decision can formed computing difference responses lower-level neurons sensitive upward motion sensitive downward motion- use functional magnetic resonance imaging categorization task subjects decide whether image presented face house test whether similar mechanism also work complex decisions human brain brain computation might performed activity within left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex greater easy decisions difficult decisions covaries difference signal face house-selective regions ventral temporal cortex predicts behavioural performance categorization task findings show even complex object categories comparison outputs different pools selectively tuned neurons general mechanism human brain computes perceptual decisions
