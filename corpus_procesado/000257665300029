positive feedback g1 cyclins ensures coherent cell cycle entry 
budding yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae start checkpoint integrates multiple internal external signals none decision enter cell cycle show start behaves like switch due systems level feedback regulatory network contrast current models proposing linear cascade start activation transcriptional positive feedback g1 cyclins cln1 cln2 induces near simultaneous expression similar gene g1/ s regulon nuclear cln2 drives coherent regulon expression whereas cytoplasmic cln2 drives efficient budding cells cln1 cln2 genes deleted frequently arrest unbudded cells incurring large fluctuation induced fitness penalty due lack cytoplasmic cln2 insufficient g1/ s regulon expression thus positive feedback amplified expression cln1 cln2 simultaneously drives robust budding rapid coherent regulon expression similar g1/ s regulatory network mammalian cells comprised non orthologous genes suggests either conservation regulatory architecture convergent evolution
