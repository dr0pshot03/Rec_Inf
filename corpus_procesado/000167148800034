impact specialized enemies dimensionality host dynamics 
although individual species persist within web interactions species data usually gathered focal species ask whether evidence species interactions detected understood patterns dynamics species alone theory predicts strong coupling prey specialist predator/parasite lead increase dimensionality preys dynamics whereas weak coupling describe rare test prediction two natural enemies added separately replicate populations moth biological reasons identify prediction increased dimensionality confirmed parasitoid wasp added although increase subtleties previously appreciated prediction failed added virus thus imprint interactions may discerned within time-series data component species system
