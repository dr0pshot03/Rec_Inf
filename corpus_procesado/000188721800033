conserved kinetochore protein shugoshin protects centromeric cohesion meiosis 
meiosis comprises pair specialized nuclear divisions produce haploid germ cells accomplish sister chromatids must segregate together first meiotic division meiosis requires sister chromatid cohesion persists centromeres factors protect centromeric cohesion meiosis remained elusive identify sgo1 shugoshin protector centromeric cohesin rec8 fission yeast also identify homologue sgo1 budding yeast provide evidence shugoshin widely conserved among eukaryotes moreover identify sgo2 paralogue shugoshin fission yeast required faithful mitotic chromosome segregation localization sgo1 sgo2 centromeres requires kinase bub1 identifying shugoshin crucial target kinetochore function bub1 findings provide insights evolution meiosis kinetochore regulation mitosis meiosis
