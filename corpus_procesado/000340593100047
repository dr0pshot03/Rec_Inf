histone chaperone asf1a required maintenance pluripotency cellular reprogramming 
unfertilized oocytes intrinsic capacity remodel sperm nuclei somatic cells discoveries cells can change phenotype differentiated embryonic state using oocytes specific transcription factors recognized two major breakthroughs biomedical field show asf1a histone-remodeling chaperone specifically enriched metaphase ii human oocyte necessary reprogramming human adult dermal fibroblasts hadfs undifferentiated induced pluripotent stem cell also show overexpression just asf1a oct4 hadfs exposed oocyte-specific paracrine growth factor gdf9 can reprogram hadfs pluripotent cells report underscores importance studying unfertilized mii oocyte means understand molecular pathways governing somatic cell reprogramming
