liquid marbles 
transport small amount liquid solid simple process owing nature contact two phases setting liquid droplet motion requires non-negligible forces contact-angle hysteresis generates force opposing motion often results deposition liquid behind drop different methods levitation-electrostatic electromagnetic acoustic even simpler aerodynamic techniques-have proposed avoid wetting problem proved rather cumbersome propose simple alternative consists encapsulating aqueous liquid droplet hydrophobic powder resulting liquid marbles found behave like soft solid show dramatically reduced adhesion solid surface result motion can generated using gravitational electrical magnetic fields moreover viscous friction associated motion small can achieve quick displacements droplets without leaks features potential benefit microfluidic applications also permit study drop non-wetting situation-an issue renewed interest following recent achievement super-hydrophobic substrates
