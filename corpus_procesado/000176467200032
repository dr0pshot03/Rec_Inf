strongly correlated superconductivity 
high-temperature superconductivity doped mott insulators cuprates contradicts conventional wisdom electron repulsion detrimental superconductivity doped fullerene conductors also strongly correlated recent discovery high-critical-temperature presumably s-wave superconductivity c field effect devices even puzzling examine dynamical mean-field solution model electron-doped fullerenes shows strong correlations can indeed enhance superconductivity close mott transition argue mechanism responsible enhancement common wider class strongly correlated models including cuprate superconductors
