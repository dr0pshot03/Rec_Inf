cardiolipin polyspecific autoreactivity two broadly neutralizing hiv- antibodies 
design human immunodeficiency virus- hiv- immunogen can induce broadly reactive neutralizing antibodies major goal hiv- vaccine development although rare human monoclonal antibodies mabs exist broadly neutralize hiv- hiv- envelope immunogens induce antibody specificities demonstrate two broadly reactive hiv- envelope gp41 human mabs 4e10 polyspecific autoantibodies reactive phospholipid cardiolipin thus current hiv- vaccines may induce types antibodies autoantigen mimicry conserved membrane-proximal epitopes virus results may important implications generating effective neutralizing antibody responses using hiv- vaccines
