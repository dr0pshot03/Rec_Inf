role experience oscillations transforming rate code temporal code 
vast majority brain areas firing rates neurons averaged several hundred milliseconds several seconds can strongly modulated provide accurate information properties inputs referred rate code however biophysical laws synaptic plasticity require precise timing spikes short timescales < ms hence critical understand physiological mechanisms can generate precise spike timing vivo relationship temporal code rate code propose mechanism temporal code can generated interaction asymmetric rate code oscillatory inhibition consistent predictions model rate temporal- codes hippocampal pyramidal neurons highly correlated furthermore temporal code becomes robust experience resulting spike timing satisfies temporal order constraints hebbian learning thus oscillations receptive field asymmetry may critical role temporal sequence learning
