closed-loop control epilepsy transcranial electrical stimulation
many neurological psychiatric diseases associated clinically detectable altered brain dynamics aberrant brain activity principle can restored electrical stimulation epilepsies abnormal patterns emerge intermittently therefore closed-loop feedback brain control leaves aspects brain functions unaffected desirable demonstrate seizure-triggered feedback transcranial electrical stimulation tes can dramatically reduce spike-and-wave episodes rodent model generalized epilepsy closed-loop tes can effective clinical tool reduce pathological brain patterns drug-resistant patients
