fasting launches crtc facilitate long-term memory formation drosophila 
canonical aversive long-term memory ltm formation drosophila requires multiple spaced trainings whereas appetitive ltm can formed single training appetitive ltm requires fasting prior training increases motivation food intake however found fasting facilitated ltm formation general; aversive ltm formation also occurred single-cycle training mild fasting applied training fasting-dependent ltm fltm spaced training-dependent ltm spltm required protein synthesis cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element-binding protein creb activity however spltm required creb activity two neural populations-mushroom body dal neurons-whereas fltm required creb activity mushroom body neurons fltm uses creb coactivator crtc whereas spltm uses coactivator cbp thus flies use distinct ltm machinery depending hunger state
