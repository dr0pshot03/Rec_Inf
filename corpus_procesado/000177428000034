influence chemical boundary layer fixity spacing lifetime mantle plumes 
seismological observations provide evidence lowermost mantle contains superposed thermal compositional boundary layers laterally heterogeneous whereas thermal boundary layer forms consequence heat flux earths outer core origin intrinsically dense chemical boundary layer remains uncertain observed zones ultra-low seismic velocity suggest dense layer may contain metals partial melt thus reasonable expect dense layer relatively low viscosity also thought instabilities thermal boundary layer lead intermittent formation rise mantle plumes flow ascending plumes can deform dense layer leading turn gradual entrainment- use analogue experiments show presence dense layer bottom mantle induces lateral variations temperature viscosity turn determine location dynamics mantle plumes dense layer causes mantle plumes become spatially fixed entrainment low-viscosity fluid enables plumes persist within earth hundreds millions years
