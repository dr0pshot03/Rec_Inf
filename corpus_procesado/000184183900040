complex hybrid origin genetic caste determination harvester ants 
caste differentiation division labour hallmarks insect societies root ecological success kin selection predicts caste determination result environmentally induced differences gene expression prediction largely supported empirical data however two exceptional cases genetically determined caste differentiation recently found harvester ants- show genetic caste determination evolved populations complex hybridization events identified four distinct genetic lineages consisting unique blends genomes parental species presumably pogonomyrmex barbatus p rugosus crosses lineages h1 h2 j1 j2 give rise workers whereas queens develop within-lineage matings although historical gene flow evident genetic exchange among lineages lineages parental species longer occurs unusual system caste determination seems evolutionarily stable
