variations younger dryas atmospheric radiocarbon explicable without ocean circulation changes 
concentration radiocarbon c- atmosphere depends production rate cosmic rays intensity carbon exchange atmosphere reservoirs example deep oceans holocene past similar years shown fluctuations atmospheric radiocarbon concentrations caused mostly variations solar magnetic field- recent progress extending radiocarbon record backwards time- indicated especially high atmospheric radiocarbon concentrations younger dryas cold period years present high concentrations interpreted result reduced exchange deep-ocean reservoir caused drastic weakening deep-ocean ventilation- present high-resolution reconstruction atmospheric radiocarbon concentrations derived annually laminated sediments two polish lakes lake gosciaz lake perespilno records indicate maximum atmospheric radiocarbon concentrations early younger dryas smaller previously believed might caused variations solar activity indication deep-ocean ventilation younger dryas significantly different todays
