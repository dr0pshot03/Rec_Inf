observation conformation-specific pathways photodissociation iodopropane ions 
many molecules can rotate freely around single bonds thereby interconvert different conformations gauche anti -disubstituted ethane classic example conformational isomerism- even though rotation occurs rapidly room temperature product selectivity seen reactions explained conformation-dependent reaction mechanisms : reactant molecules differing conformation located different positions reaction path may undergo different reactions direct verification effect difficult energy barrier separating conformational isomers low ambient conditions reactants one conformation will present using temperatures low enough suppress interconversion different conformations gauche--iodopropane ions anti--iodopropane ions selectively generated show kinetic energy released photodissociation iodopropane ions depends strongly conformation ions thermodynamic arguments ab initio calculations indicate difference kinetic energy release results differences reaction mechanism gauche--iodopropane ions forming propyl ions anti--iodopropane ions forming protonated cyclopropane ions findings suggest well-known concept conformation selection forms basis simple scheme reaction control thus providing cases attractive alternative involved schemes utilize phase pulse shape laser beams control chemical reactions-
