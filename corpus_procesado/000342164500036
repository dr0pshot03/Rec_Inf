evidence global electron transportation jovian inner magnetosphere 
jupiters magnetosphere strong particle accelerator contains ultrarelativistic electrons inner part thought accelerated whistler-mode waves excited anisotropic hot electrons > kiloelectron volts injected outer magnetosphere however electron transportation inner magnetosphere well understood analyzing extreme ultraviolet line emission inner magnetosphere show evidence global inward transport flux tubes containing hot plasma high-spectral-resolution scanning observations io plasma torus inner magnetosphere enable us generate radial profiles hot electron fraction gradually decreases decreasing radial distance despite short collisional time scale thermalize rapidly indicates fast continuous resupply hot electrons responsible exciting whistler-mode waves
