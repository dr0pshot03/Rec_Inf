decay aftershock density distance indicates triggering dynamic stress 
majority earthquakes aftershocks yet aftershock physics well understood many studies suggest static stress changes trigger aftershocks recent work suggests shaking dynamic stresses may also play role measure decay aftershocks function distance magnitude mainshocks order clarify aftershock triggering process find short times main-shock low background seismicity rates allow good aftershock detection decay well fitted single inverse power law distances km consistency trend indicates triggering mechanism working entire range static stress changes distant aftershocks negligible suggests dynamic stresses may triggering aftershocks infer observed aftershock density consistent probability triggering aftershocks nearly proportional seismic wave amplitude data fitted well models combine static stress change evolution frictionally locked faults
