early tagging cortical networks required formation enduring associative memory
although formation stabilization long-lasting associative memories thought require time-dependent coordinated hippocampal-cortical interactions underlying mechanisms remain unclear present evidence neurons rat cortex must undergo tagging process upon encoding ensure progressive hippocampal-driven rewiring cortical networks support remote memory storage process ampa-and n-methyl-d-aspartate receptor-dependent information-specific capable modulating remote memory persistence affecting temporal dynamics hippocampal-cortical interactions post-learning reinforcement tagging process via time-limited epigenetic modifications resulted improved remote memory retrieval thus early tagging cortical networks crucial neurobiological process remote memory formation whose functional properties fit requirements imposed extended time scale systems-level memory consolidation
