first chemical enrichment universe formation hyper metal-poor stars 
recent discovery hyper-metal-poor hmp star metalticity fe/h smaller / solar ratio together one earlier hmp star raised challenging question whether hmp stars actual first-generation tow-mass stars universe argue hmp stars second-generation stars formed gases chemically enriched first-generation supernovae key solution unusual abundance patterns hmp stars similarities differences can reproduce abundance features core-collapse faint supernova models include extensive matter mixing fallback explosions
