glutamate-dependent neuroglial calcium signaling differs young adult brain
extensive literature shows astrocytes exhibit metabotropic glutamate receptor mglur5-dependent increases cytosolic calcium ions ca2+ response glutamatergic transmission turn modulate neuronal activity ca2+-dependent release gliotransmitters findings based studies young rodents led concept tripartite synapse astrocytes actively participate neurotransmission using genomic analysis immunoelectron microscopy two-photon microscopy astrocytic ca2+ signaling vivo found astrocytic expression mglur5 developmentally regulated undetectable postnatal week contrast mglur3 whose activation inhibits adenylate cyclase calcium signaling expressed astrocytes developmental stages neuroglial signaling adult brain may therefore occur manner fundamentally distinct exhibited development
