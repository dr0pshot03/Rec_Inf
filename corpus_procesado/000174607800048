spike-timing-dependent synaptic modification induced natural spike trains 
strength connection two neurons can modified activity way depends timing neuronal firing either side synapse- spike-timing-dependent plasticity stdp studied systematically varying intervals pre postsynaptic spikes studied stdp operates context natural spike trains found visual cortical slices contribution pre-/postsynaptic spike pair synaptic modification depends interval pair also timing preceding spikes efficacy spike synaptic modification suppressed preceding spike neuron occurring within several tens milliseconds direction magnitude synaptic modifications induced spike patterns recorded vivo response natural visual stimuli well predicted incorporating suppressive inter-spike interaction within neuron thus activity-induced synaptic modification depends relative spike timing neurons also spiking pattern within neuron natural spike trains timing first spike burst dominant synaptic modification
