n-terminal acetylation cellular proteins creates specific degradation signals 
retained n-terminal methionine met residue nascent protein often n-terminally acetylated nt-acetylated removal n-terminal met met-aminopeptidases frequently leads nt-acetylation resulting n-terminal alanine ala valine val serine ser threonine thr cysteine cys residues although majority eukaryotic proteins example % human proteins cotranslationally nt-acetylated function extensively studied modification largely unknown using yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae found nt-acetylated met residue act degradation signal degron targeted doa10 ubiquitin ligase moreover doa10 also recognized nt-acetylated ala val ser thr cys residues several examined proteins diverse functions contained n-terminal degrons termed acn-degrons prevalent class degradation signals cellular proteins
