pre-mrna splicing mrna export linked direct interactions uap56 aly 
recent studies indicate splicing pre-messenger rna export mrna normally coupled vivo- splicing conserved mrna export factor aly recruited spliced mrna-protein complex mrnp targets mrna export present known aly recruited spliced mrnp show conserved dead-box helicase uap56 functions spliceosome assembly- interacts directly highly specifically aly moreover uap56 present together aly spliced mrnp significantly excess uap56 potent dominant negative inhibitor mrna export excess uap56 also inhibits recruitment aly spliced mrnp furthermore mutation aly blocks interaction uap56 prevents recruitment aly spliced mrnp data suggest splicing factor uap56 functions coupling splicing export machineries recruiting aly spliced mrnp
