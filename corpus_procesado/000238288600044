element partitioning: role melt structure composition
segregated coexisting gabbroic granitic melts centrifuging high pressures temperatures measured trace element compositions melts laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry results demonstrate effect melt structure contributes one order magnitude crystal/melt partition coefficients partitioning alkali alkaline earth elements strongly depends field strength: amphoteric lone pair electron elements partition polymerized granitic melt rare earth transition high field strength elements coordinated nonbridging oxygens partition remarkably similar gabbroic melt regular solution model predicts effects
