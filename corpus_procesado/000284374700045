calcium-permeable ampa receptor dynamics mediate fear memory erasure 
traumatic fear memories can inhibited behavioral therapy humans extinction training rodent models prone recur conditions however treatments generate permanent effect behavior suggests emotional memory erasure occurred neural basis disparate outcomes unknown found central component extinction-induced erasure synaptic removal calcium-permeable alpha-amino--hydroxyl--methyl--isoxazole-propionate receptors ampars lateral amygdala transient up-regulation form plasticity involves phosphorylation glutamate receptor subunit ampa receptor defines temporal window fear memory can degraded behavioral experience results reveal molecular mechanism fear erasure relative instability recent memory
