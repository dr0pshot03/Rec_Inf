nuclear lamin-a scales tissue stiffness enhances matrix-directed differentiation 
tissues can soft like fat bears little stress stiff like bone sustains high stress whether systematic relationship tissue mechanics differentiation unknown proteomics analyses revealed levels nucleoskeletal protein lamin-a scaled tissue elasticity e levels collagens extracellular matrix determine e stem cell differentiation fat soft matrix enhanced low lamin-a levels whereas differentiation bone stiff matrix enhanced high lamin-a levels matrix stiffness directly influenced lamin-a protein levels although lamin-a transcription regulated vitamin a/retinoic acid ra pathway broad roles development nuclear entry ra receptors modulated lamin-a protein tissue stiffness stress thus increase lamin-a levels stabilize nucleus also contributing lineage determination
