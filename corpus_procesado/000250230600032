manipulation host-cell pathways bacterial pathogens 
bacterial pathogens operate attacking crucial intracellular pathways hosts pathogens usually target one intracellular pathway often interact several points pathways commandeer fully although different bacterial pathogens tend exploit similar pathway components host way hijack host cells usually differs knowledge pathogens target distinct cytoskeletal components immune-cell signalling pathways rapidly advancing together understanding bacterial virulence molecular level studying bacterial pathogens subvert host-cell pathways central understanding infectious disease
