organogenesis dish: modeling development disease using organoid technologies
classical experiments performed half century ago demonstrated immense self-organizing capacity vertebrate cells even complete dissociation cells can reaggregate reconstruct original architecture organ recently outstanding feature used rebuild organ parts even complete organs tissue embryonic stem cells stem cell-derived three-dimensional cultures called organoids organoids can grown human stem cells patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells potential model human development disease furthermore potential drug testing even future organ replacement strategies summarize rapidly evolving field outline potential organoid technology future biomedical research
