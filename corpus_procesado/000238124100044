near-synchronous interhemispheric termination last glacial maximum mid-latitudes
isotopic records polar ice cores imply globally asynchronous warming end last glaciation however exposure dates show large-scale retreat mid-latitude last glacial maximum glaciers commenced time hemispheres timing retreat consistent onset temperature atmospheric co2 increases antarctic ice cores suggest global trend rising summer temperatures end last glacial maximum obscured north atlantic regions hypercold winters associated unusually extensive winter sea ice
