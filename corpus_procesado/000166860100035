cell biology principles buffering genetic variation
genetic research used inbred organisms explored complexity natural genetic variation present outbred populations translation genotype phenotype complicated gene interactions observed epistasis canalization robustness buffering analysis double mutations inbred experimental organisms suggests principles gene interaction may apply natural variation well buffering variation one gene often due small number genes function biochemical process however buffering can also result genes functioning processes extrinsic primary gene
