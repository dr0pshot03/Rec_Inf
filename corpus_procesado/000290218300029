crystal structure oxygen-evolving photosystem ii resolution angstrom 
photosystem ii site photosynthetic water oxidation contains subunits total molecular mass kda structure photosystem ii reported resolutions angstrom resolutions provided much information arrangement protein subunits cofactors insufficient reveal detailed structure catalytic centre water splitting report crystal structure photosystem ii resolution angstrom electron density map located metal atoms mn4cao5 cluster together ligands found five oxygen atoms served oxo bridges linking five metal atoms four water molecules bound mn4cao5 cluster; may therefore serve substrates dioxygen formation identified water molecules photosystem ii monomer formed extensive hydrogen-bonding networks may serve channels protons water oxygen molecules determination high-resolution structure photosystem ii will allow us analyse understand functions great detail
