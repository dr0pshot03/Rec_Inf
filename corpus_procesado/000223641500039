decline surface temperature salinity western tropical pacific ocean holocene epoch
present-day climate surface water salinities low western tropical pacific ocean increase towards eastern part basin salinity surface waters tropical pacific ocean thought controlled combination atmospheric convection precipitation evaporation ocean dynamics interannual timescales significant variability associated el nino/southern oscillation cycles however little known variability coupled ocean atmosphere system timescales centuries millennia combine oxygen isotope mg/ca data foraminifers retrieved three sediment cores western tropical pacific ocean reconstruct holocene sea surface temperatures salinities region find decrease sea surface temperatures similar to0 degreesc past yr whereas sea surface salinities decreased similar to1 practical salinity units data imply either pacific basin whole become progressively less salty present salinity gradient along equator developed relatively recently
