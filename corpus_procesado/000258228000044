escape adaptive conflict duplication anthocyanin pathway gene
gene duplications recognized important source evolutionary innovation adaptation since least haldane varying fates may partly explain vast disparity observed genome sizes expected fates gene duplications involve primarily non-adaptive substitutions leading either non-functionalization one duplicate copy subfunctionalization neither yields novel function significant evolutionary problem thus elucidating mechanisms adaptive evolutionary change leading evolutionary novelty currently widely recognized adaptive process involving gene duplication neo-functionalization neo-f one copy undergoes directional selection perform novel function duplication alternative understudied adaptive fate proposed escape adaptive conflict eac single-copy gene selected perform novel function maintaining ancestral function gene constrained improving either novel ancestral function detrimental pleiotropic effects function duplication one copy free improve novel function whereas selected improve ancestral function first present two criteria can used distinguish neo-f eac using tests positive selection assays enzyme function demonstrate adaptive evolutionary change duplicated gene anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway morning glories ipomoea best interpreted eac finally argue phenomenon likely occurs often previously believed may thus represent important mechanism generating evolutionary novelty
