radar imaging binary near-earth asteroid kw4 
high-resolution radar images reveal near-earth asteroid kw4 binary system similar -kilometer-diameter primary alpha unconsolidated gravitational aggregate spin period similar hours bulk density similar grams per cubic centimeter porosity similar % oblate shape dominated equatorial ridge objects potential-energy minimum similar -kilometer secondary beta elongated probably denser alpha average orbit alpha circular radius similar kilometers period similar hours average rotation synchronous long axis pointed toward alpha librational departures orientation evident exotic physical dynamical properties may common among near-earth binaries
