transcription rna interference formation heterochromatin
transcription heterochromatin seems oxymoron surely silenced form chromatin transcribed frequent reports low-level transcription heterochromatic regions several hundred genes found regions drosophila strikingly recent investigations implicate rna interference mechanisms targeting maintaining heterochromatin mechanisms inherently dependent transcription silencing chromatin might involve transacting sources crucial small rnas carry rna interference cases transcription region silenced seems required apparent contradiction
