skew mantle upwelling beneath east pacific rise governs segmentation
mantle upwelling essential generation new oceanic crust mid-ocean ridges generally assumed upwelling symmetric beneath active ridges however use seismic imaging show isotropic anisotropic structure mantle rotated beneath east pacific rise isotropic structure defines pattern magma delivery mantle crust find segmentation rise crest transform faults correlates well distribution mantle melt azimuth seismic anisotropy constrains direction mantle flow rotated nearly degrees anticlockwise plate-spreading direction mismatch locus mantle melt delivery morphologic ridge axis results systematic differences areas on-axis off-axis melt supply conclude skew asthenospheric upwelling transport governs segmentation east pacific rise variations intensity ridge crest processes
