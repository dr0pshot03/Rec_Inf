femtosecond multidimensional imaging molecular dissociation
coupled electronic vibrational motions governing chemical processes best viewed molecules point view-the molecular frame measurements made laboratory frame often conceal information random orientations molecule can take used combination time-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy multidimensional coincidence imaging spectroscopy ab initio computation trace complete reactant-to-product pathway-the photodissociation nitric oxide dimer-from molecules point view femtosecond time scale method revealed elusive photochemical process involving intermediate electronic configurations
