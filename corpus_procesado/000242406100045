microfluidic digital pcr enables multigene analysis individual environmental bacteria
gene inventory metagenomic techniques allowed rapid exploration bacterial diversity potential physiologies present within microbial communities however remains nontrivial discover identities environmental bacteria carrying two genes interest used microfluidic digital polymerase chain reaction pcr amplify analyze multiple different genes obtained single bacterial cells harvested nature gene encoding key enzyme involved mutualistic symbiosis occurring termites gut microbiota used experimental hook discover previously unknown ribosomal rna based species identity several symbionts ability systematically identify bacteria carrying particular gene link two genes interest single species residing complex ecosystems opens new opportunities research environment
