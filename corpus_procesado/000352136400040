redox cycling feii feiii magnetite fe-metabolizing bacteria 
microorganisms primary control redox-induced cycling iron environment despite ability bacteria grow using feii feiii bound solid-phase iron minerals currently unknown whether changing environmental conditions enable sharing electrons mixed-valent iron oxides bacteria different metabolisms show magnetic spectroscopic measurements phototrophic feii-oxidizing bacterium rhodopseudomonas palustris tie- oxidizes magnetite fe3o4 nanoparticles using light energy process reversible co-cultures anaerobic feiii-reducing bacterium geobacter sulfurreducens results demonstrate fe ions bound highly crystalline mineral magnetite bioavailable electron sinks electron sources varying environmental conditions effectively rendering magnetite naturally occurring battery
