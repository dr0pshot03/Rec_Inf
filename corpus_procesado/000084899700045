molecular imprinting bulk microporous silica
molecular imprinting aims create solid materials containing chemical functionalities spatially organized covalent non-covalent interactions imprint template molecules synthesis process subsequent removal imprint molecules leaves behind designed sites recognition small molecules making material ideally suited applications separations chemical sensing catalysis- now molecular imprinting bulk polymers- polymer silica surfaces reported extension methods wider range materials remains problematic example formation substrate-specific cavities within bulk silica conceptually straightforward difficult accomplish experimentally describe imprinting bulk amorphous silicas single aromatic rings carrying three aminopropyltriethoxysilane side groups generates occupies microporosity attaches functional organic groups pore walls controlled fashion triethoxysilane part molecules side groups incorporated silica framework sol-gel synthesis subsequent removal aromatic core creates cavity spatially organized aminopropyl groups covalently anchored pore walls find imprinted silicas act shape-selective base catalysts strategy can extended imprint functional groups give access wide range functionalized materials
