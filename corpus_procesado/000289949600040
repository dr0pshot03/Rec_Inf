system continuous directed evolution biomolecules
laboratory evolution generated many biomolecules desired properties single round mutation gene expression screening selection replication typically requires days longer frequent human intervention evolutionary success dependent total number rounds performed means performing laboratory evolution continuously rapidly dramatically enhance effectiveness although researchers accelerated individual steps evolutionary cycle- previous example continuous directed evolution landmark study wright joyce continuously evolved rna ligase ribozymes vitro replication cycle unfortunately easily adapted biomolecules describe system enables continuous directed evolution gene-encoded molecules can linked protein production escherichia coli phage-assisted continuous evolution pace evolving genes transferred host cell host cell modified bacteriophage life cycle manner dependent activity interest dozens rounds evolution can occur single day pace without human intervention using pace evolved t7 rna polymerase rnap variants recognize distinct promoter initiate transcripts atp instead gtp initiate transcripts ctp one example pace executed rounds protein evolution course days starting undetectable activity levels two cases enzymes three target activities emerged less week pace three cases pace-evolved polymerase activities exceeded comparable wild-type t7 rnap wild-type promoter representing improvements several hundred-fold greatly accelerating laboratory evolution pace may provide solutions otherwise intractable directed evolution problems address novel questions molecular evolution
