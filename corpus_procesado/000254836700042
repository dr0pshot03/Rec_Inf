agonist toll-like receptor radioprotective activity mouse primate models
toxicity ionizing radiation associated massive apoptosis radiosensitive organs investigate whether drug activates signaling mechanism used tumor cells suppress apoptosis can protect healthy cells harmful effects radiation studied cblb502 polypeptide drug derived salmonella flagellin binds toll-like receptor tlr5 activates nuclear factor-kappa b signaling single injection cblb502 lethal total-body irradiation protected mice gastrointestinal hematopoietic acute radiation syndromes resulted improved survival cblb502 injected irradiation also enhanced survival lower radiation doses noteworthy drug decrease tumor radiosensitivity mouse models cblb502 also showed radioprotective activity lethally irradiated rhesus monkeys thus tlr5 agonists potentially improve therapeutic index cancer radiotherapy serve biological protectants radiation emergencies
