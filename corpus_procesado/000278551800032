nuclear reprogramming pluripotent state three approaches
stable states differentiated cells now known controlled dynamic mechanisms can easily perturbed adult cell can therefore reprogrammed altering pattern gene expression hence fate typical another cell type shown three distinct experimental approaches nuclear reprogramming: nuclear transfer cell fusion transcription-factor transduction using approaches nuclei terminally differentiated somatic cells can induced express genes typical embryonic stem cells can differentiate form cell types body remarkable discovery cellular plasticity important medical applications
