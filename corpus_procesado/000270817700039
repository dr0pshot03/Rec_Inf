intracellular dynamics hippocampal place cells virtual navigation
hippocampal place cells encode spatial information rate temporal codes examine mechanisms underlying hippocampal coding measured intracellular dynamics place cells combining vivo whole-cell recordings virtual-reality system head-restrained mice running spherical treadmill interacted computer-generated visual environment perform spatial behaviours robust place-cell activity present movement along virtual linear track whole-cell recordings identified three subthreshold signatures place fields: asymmetric ramp-like depolarization baseline membrane potential increase amplitude intracellular theta oscillations phase precession intracellular theta oscillation relative extracellularly recorded theta rhythm intracellular dynamics underlie primary features place-cell rate temporal codes virtual-reality system developed will enable new experimental approaches study neural circuits underlying navigation
