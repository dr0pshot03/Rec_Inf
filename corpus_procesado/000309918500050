foxo3-irf7 gene regulatory circuit limits inflammatory sequelae antiviral responses
antiviral responses must tightly regulated defend rapidly infection minimizing inflammatory damage type interferons ifn-i crucial mediators antiviral responses transcription regulated variety transcription factors principal among family interferon regulatory factors irfs irf gene regulatory networks complex contain multiple feedback loops tools systems biology well suited elucidate complex interactions give rise precise coordination interferon response used unbiased systems approach predict member forkhead family transcription factors foxo3 negative regulator subset antiviral genes prediction validated using macrophages isolated foxo3-null mice genome-wide location analysis combined gene deletion studies identified irf7 gene critical target foxo3 foxo3 identified negative regulator irf7 transcription demonstrated foxo3 irf7 ifn-i forma coherent feed-forward regulatory circuit data suggest foxo3-irf7 regulatory circuit represents novel mechanism establishing requisite set points interferon pathway balances beneficial effects deleterious sequelae antiviral response
