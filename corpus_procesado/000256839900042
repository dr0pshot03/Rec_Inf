entangled states trapped atomic ions 
process information using quantum-mechanical principles states individual particles need entangled manipulated one way use trapped laser-cooled atomic ions attaining general-purpose quantum computer however distant goal recent experiments show just entangled trapped ions can used improve precision measurements entanglement systems can scaled larger numbers ions simulations intractable classical computer might become possible
