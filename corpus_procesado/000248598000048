hebbian stdp mushroom bodies facilitates synchronous flow olfactory information locusts 
odour representations insects undergo progressive transformations decorrelation- receptor array presumed site odour learning mushroom body- odours represented sparse assemblies kenyon cells large population using intracellular recordings vivo examined transmission plasticity synapse made kenyon cells onto downstream targets locusts find individual synapses excitatory undergo hebbian spike-timing dependent plasticity stdp- a+/ ms timescale placed context odour-evoked kenyon cell activity hz oscillatory population discharge form stdp enhances synchronization kenyon cells targets thus helps preserve propagation odour-specific codes olfactory system
