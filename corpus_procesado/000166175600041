earths missing niobium may core
earths metallic core segregated silicate mantle moderately siderophile iron-loving elements vanadium chromium thought entered metal phase thus causing observed depletions elements silicate part earth contrast refractory lithophile elements calcium scandium rare-earth elements known present proportions silicate portion earth chondritic meteorites thought represent primitive planetary material hence lithophile elements apparently enter core niobium always considered lithophile refractory yet observed depleted relative elements type crust upper mantle observation used infer existence hidden niobium-rich reservoirs earths deep mantle show however niobium vanadium partition virtually identical fashion liquid metal liquid silicate high pressure thus significant fraction earths vanadium entered core thought similar fraction niobium hidden reservoir need sought earths deep mantle
