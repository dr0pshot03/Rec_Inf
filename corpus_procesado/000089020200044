ant-like task allocation recruitment cooperative robots 
one greatest challenges robotics create machines able interact unpredictable environments real time possible solution may use swarms robots behaving self-organized manner similar workers ant colony1- efficient mechanisms division labour particular series-parallel operation transfer information among group members6 key components tremendous ecological success ants78 show general principles regulating division labour ant colonies indeed allow design flexible robust effective robotic systems groups robots using ant-inspired algorithms decentralized control techniques foraged efficiently maintained higher levels group energy single robots benefits group living decreased larger groups probably interference foraging intriguingly similar relationship group size efficiency documented social insects9- moreover food items clustered groups robots recruit robots ant-like manner efficient groups without information transfer suggesting group dynamics swarms robots may follow rules similar governing social insects
