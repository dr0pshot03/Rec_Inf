positive feedback sharpens anaphase switch 
onset anaphase sister chromatid cohesion dissolved abruptly irreversibly ensuring chromosome pairs disjoin almost simultaneously regulatory mechanisms generate switch like behaviour unclear anaphase initiated ubiquitin ligase anaphase promoting complex apc triggers destruction securin thereby allowing separase protease disrupt sister chromatid cohesion- demonstrate cyclin dependent kinase cdk1 dependent phosphorylation securin near destruction box motif inhibits securin ubiquitination apc phosphatase cdc14 reverses securin phosphorylation thereby increasing rate securin ubiquitination separase known activate cdc14 refs results support existence positive feedback loop increases abruptness anaphase consistent model show mutations disrupt securin phosphoregulation decrease synchrony chromosome segregation results also suggest coupling securin degradation changes cdk1 cdc14 activities helps coordinate initiation sister chromatid separation changes spindle dynamics
