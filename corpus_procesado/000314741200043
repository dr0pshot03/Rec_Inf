studying arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia patient-specific ipscs 
cellular reprogramming somatic cells patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cellsipscs enables vitro modelling human genetic disorders pathogenic investigations therapeutic screens- however using ipsc-derived cardiomyocytes ipsc-cms model adult-onset heart disease remains challenging owing uncertainty regarding ability relatively immature ipsc-cms fully recapitulate adult disease phenotypes arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia/cardiomyopathy arvd/c inherited heart disease characterized pathological fatty infiltration cardiomyocyte loss predominantly right ventricles associated life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias % affected individuals desmosome gene mutations commonly pkp2 encoding plakophilin ref median age presentation arvd/c years used previously published methods generate ipsc lines fibroblasts two patients arvd/c pkp2 mutations mutant pkp2 ipsc-cms demonstrate abnormal plakoglobin nuclear translocation decreased beta-catenin activity cardiogenic conditions yet abnormal features insufficient reproduce pathological phenotypes arvd/c standard cardiogenic conditions show induction adult-like metabolic energetics embryonic/glycolytic state abnormal peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma ppar-gamma activation underlie pathogenesis arvd/c co-activating normal ppar-alpha-dependent metabolism abnormal ppar-gamma pathway beating embryoid bodies ebs defined media established efficient arvd/c vitro model within months model manifests exaggerated lipogenesis apoptosis mutant pkp2 ipsc-cms ipsc-cms homozygous pkp2 mutation also calcium-handling deficits study first demonstrate induction adult-like metabolism critical role establishing adult-onset disease model using patient-specific ipscs using model revealed crucial pathogenic insights metabolic derangement adult-like metabolic milieu underlies arvd/c pathologies enabling us propose novel disease-modifying therapeutic strategies
