first-order liquid-liquid phase transition phosphorus 
first-order structural phase transitions common crystalline solids whereas first-order liquid-liquid phase transitions transitions two distinct liquid forms different density entropy exceedingly rare pure substances- bur recent theoretical experimental studies shown evidence transition several materials including supercooled water- liquid carbon report sit x-ray diffraction observation liquid-liquid transition phosphorus involving abrupt pressure-induced structural change two distinct liquid forms addition known form liquid phosphorus-a molecular liquid comprising tetrahedral p molecules-we found polymeric form pressures cpa changing pressure results reversible transformation low-pressure molecular form high-pressure polymeric form transformation sharp rapid occurring within minutes pressure range less gpa transformation two forms liquid coexist features strongly suggestive first-order liquid-liquid phase transition
