mutations increase life span c-elegans inhibit tumor growth
mutations gld cause lethal germline tumors nematode caenorhabditis elegans find wide variety mutations extend c elegans life span confer resistance tumors long life spans daf-/insulin-receptor mutants shortened gld mutations attribute finding decreased cell division increased daf-/p53 dependent apoptosis within tumors mutations increase life span restricting food intake inhibiting respiration affect apoptosis reduced tumor cell division unexpectedly none longevity mutations affected mitosis normal germlines finding suggests cellular changes lead longevity preferentially antagonize tumor cell growth
