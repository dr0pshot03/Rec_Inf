characterization two classes small molecule inhibitors arp2/ complex 
polymerization actin filaments directed actin-related protein arp/ complex supports many types cellular movements however questions remain regarding relative contributions arp2/ complex versus mechanisms actin filament nucleation processes path finding neuronal growth cones lack simple methods inhibit arp2/ complex reversibly living cells describe two classes small molecules bind different sites arp2/ complex inhibit ability nucleate actin filaments ck binds arp2 arp3 appears block movement arp2 arp3 active conformation ck inserts hydrophobic core arp3 alters conformation classes compounds inhibit formation actin filament comet tails listeria podosomes monocytes two inhibitors different mechanisms action provide powerful approach studying arp2/ complex living cells
