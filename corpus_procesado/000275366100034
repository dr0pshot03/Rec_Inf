electron liquids solids one dimension 
even though bulk metallic systems contain large number strongly interacting electrons properties well described within landaus fermi liquid theory non-interacting quasiparticles although many higher-dimensional systems can successfully understood basis non-interacting theories possible one-dimensional systems confined narrow channels electron interaction gives rise exotic phenomena spin-charge separation emergence correlated-electron insulators strongly correlated electronic behaviour recently seen experiments one-dimensional carbon nanotubes nanowires behaviour challenges theoretical description systems
