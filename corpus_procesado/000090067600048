integration multiple signals cooperative regulation n-wasp-arp2/ complex 
protein n-wasp [a homolog wiskott-aldrich syndrome protein waspi regulates actin polymerization stimulating actin-nucleating activity actin-related protein / arp2/ complex n-wasp tightly regulated multiple signals: costimulation cdc42 phosphatidylinositol -bisphosphate pip2 yields potent polymerization found regulation requires n-wasps constitutively active output domain vca two regulatory domains: cdc42-binding domain previously undescribed pip2-binding domain absence stimuli regulatory modules together hold vca-arp2/ complex inactive "closed" conformation state cdc42 pip2-binding sites masked binding either input destabilizes closed state enhances binding input cooperative activation mechanism shows combinations simple binding domains can used integrate amplify coincident signals
