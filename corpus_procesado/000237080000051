targeting c-reactive protein treatment cardiovascular disease 
complement-mediated inflammation exacerbates tissue injury ischaemic necrosis heart attacks strokes common causes death developed countries large infarct size increases immediate morbidity mortality survivors acute event larger non-functional scars adversely affect long-term prognosis thus important unmet medical need new cardioprotective neuroprotective treatments previously shown human c-reactive protein crp classical acute-phase protein binds ligands exposed damaged tissue activates complement increases myocardial cerebral infarct size rats subjected coronary cerebral artery ligation respectively rat crp activate rat complement whereas human crp activates rat human complement administration human crp rats thus excellent model actions endogenous human crp report design synthesis efficacy -bisphosphocholine-hexane specific small-molecule inhibitor crp five molecules palindromic compound bound two pentameric crp molecules crosslinking occluding ligand-binding b-face crp blocking functions administration -bisphosphocholine-hexane rats undergoing acute myocardial infarction abrogated increase infarct size cardiac dysfunction produced injection human crp therapeutic inhibition crp thus promising new approach cardioprotection acute myocardial infarction may also provide neuroprotection stroke potential wider applications include inflammatory infective tissue-damaging conditions characterized increased crp production binding crp exposed ligands damaged cells may lead complement-mediated exacerbation tissue injury
