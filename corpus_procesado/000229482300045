importance threading dislocations motion domain boundaries thin films
thin films often present domain structures whose detailed evolution subject debate analyze evolution copper films contain rotational stacking domains ruthenium real-time observation low-energy electron microscopy shows stacking domains evolve seemingly complex way stacking boundaries move preferred directions motion extremely uneven become stuck reach rotational boundaries show behavior occurs stacking-boundary motion impeded threading dislocations study underscores coarse-scale evolution thin films can controlled defects
