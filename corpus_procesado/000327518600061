long-distance integration nuclear erk signaling triggered activation dendritic spines
late phase long-term potentiation ltp glutamatergic synapses thought underlie long-lasting memory requires gene transcription nucleus however mechanism signaling initiated synapses transmitted nucleus induce transcription remained elusive found induction ltp three seven dendritic spines rat ca1 pyramidal neurons sufficient activate extracellular signal-regulated kinase erk nucleus regulate downstream transcription factors signaling individual spines integrated wide range time > minutes space > micrometers spatially dispersed inputs multiple branches activated nuclear erk much efficiently clustered inputs one branch thus biochemical signals individual dendritic spines exert profound effects nuclear signaling
