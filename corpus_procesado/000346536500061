element-specific anisotropic growth shaped platinum alloy nanocrystals 
morphological shape chemistry biology owes existence anisotropic growth closely coupled distinct functionality although much known principal growth mechanisms monometallic shaped nanocrystals anisotropic growth shaped alloy nanocrystals still poorly understood using aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy reveal element-specific anisotropic growth mechanism platinum pt bimetallic nano-octahedra compositional anisotropy couples geometric anisotropy pt-rich phase evolves precursor nanohexapods followed slower step-induced deposition m-rich m ni co etc phase concave hexapod surface forming octahedral facets finding explains earlier reports unusual compositional segregations chemical degradation pathways bimetallic polyhedral catalysts may aid rational synthesis shaped alloy catalysts desired compositional patterns properties
